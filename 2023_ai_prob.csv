9,806554,5,"A basic, but fun little mouse that is absolutely worth it","How much should a computer mouse cost? If I was asked this question a week ago, I'd probably estimate about $10-$15 for a basic mouse, and I could even imagine $20-$30 (or even more) for a super fancy, 20-button, ergonomic, ultra-responsive space mouse. At the time of this review, this mouse is $5. That price would be understandable if this was one of those old school non-optical, trackball mice (with the ball at the bottom). But this mouse is sleek...it's rechargeable (via included micro-USB...though I would prefer if it was the more popular USB-C)...it can be connected with Bluetooth or USB receiver (I've tried both, and they are responsive and without issues, so far)...it changes LED colors...and it's silent. Admittedly, this is not a particularly high-end mouse. For example, there is no forward-back option, there are no programming buttons, it's not shaped with the ergonomic curves, and the scroll wheel is not textured (which I prefer over a smooth one). This mouse is an attractive matte color, it is very portable/low-height, it has 3 DPI levels (nothing too sensitive, but more than adequate for my needs), and both the left and right click buttons are fairly quiet. Functionally, it glides smoothly on my Roccat mousepad, and I have had no issues with connectivity yet. In all honesty, despite the shortcomings, I really appreciate this mouse, and for the price, it is an absolute bargain.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n2YJ9YI8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n2YJ9YI8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n2YJ9YI8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rJv8pkSTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rJv8pkSTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rJv8pkSTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BVM83MFF,B0C96F9MWJ,AGSIU3JOYC6CJLFFB7APDN3UGSHQ,2023-03-09 06:27:17.509,0,False,0.009365594014525414

99,502635,4,"Overkill for what I am doing, but why not!","I had a set of the ZenWifi XT8s (Triband Wifi 6 = no 6ghz). Got this to boost wifi in the house AND get the 10gbe ports for LAN use. (Streaming from a NAS, etc.). It's overkill, but I wanted to transfer files fast. I followed DongKnowsTech dot com and had the Mesh setup pretty quickly. Did have to restart everything a few times, but no biggie. Upgraded firmware to latest and set up network. Everything is working fine, EXCEPT the 10gbe ports seem finnicky. To be more specific, they seem to slow down over time. I can reboot the router, and get 950mbps, but after awhile, it will drop to 800, then 650, etc. This is WAN btw. I really have not test LAN speed, but appears to be pretty quick. A quick reboot of the router fixes the issue temporarily. I installed the latest Merlin firmware, and the issue seems to persist. I am thinking this will be fixed in a future firmware release, but who knows. Frankly, however, there is no real world difference between 600 mbps and 900. They are both plenty fast. You do want to get what you are paying your ISP for though. Wifi is great, even though we only have one device (a laptop) in the house capable of 6ghz (Wifi 6e). Otherwise, the main purpose of this (for me) is the Multi-gigabit LAN capability and AiMesh compatability. I have this paired with a TRENDnet TEG-S762 10g switch to feed the AiMesh nodes at 2.5g.  All cables are Cat 8 (supposedly). Overall, a very powerful router, although expensive.

We started dropping the internet signal intermittently . It would reboot automatically. I contacted Xfinity about this issue since they are my provider. They were very good about trying to fix the issue. They installed a signal monitor for several days and found that it was a problem with this modem. It has a 2 year warranty through Motorola. At this time I am having some difficulty reaching them for support. Hopefully it will get replaced.<br /><br />Wanted to add some info: I had contact with motorola support. I had to send them reports from the modem. They told me that some of my bonded channels had too much power and was out of range for the modem. my internet provider had been to my residence and placed a signal monitor on for a few days after checking that all connections were good. It showed that the signals and power levels were all within their parameters. My xfinity tech sent me the report which I sent to the motorola tech. I was wanting them to replace it and I would try another unit but now I am just stuck with the Motorola tech saying that their equipment is fine.  In my opinion, the motorola equipment is built with too tight of tolerances. They really don't stand behind their product. I was asked for an opinion about the service I received from Motorola. I explained everything that I have laid out here and have received no response.<br />Just thought I would put this out there so everyone else would know. Buyer beware.

143,70730,1,Mixed feelings,"I have had the first generation, as well as the second generation fire TV cube. I was very excited to purchase the third generation.<br /><br />After having use this product for about a month, I would not recommend upgrading if you already have a second generation. The reason for this is that I am not seen any performance improvement. The addition of a USB port is nice, but is USB 2.0 and this is highly disappointing.  The HDMI input may have some nice applications for people, but it does not provide value for me. The ethernet addition is also nice but 100 Mbps is also highly disappointing.  Modern Wi-Fi provides far faster speeds.<br /><br />There is another strange thing occurring with my Sony XBR TV around power management that was not occurring with the prior generations. This is one of the more frustrating issues. The device control with the third generation based on my experience is worse than prior generations.<br /><br />I considered returning the device and probably should have, but I will continue to use it with an open mind. It would have been nice to have seen a thunderbolt port and gigabit ethernet. It is highly surprising that such old technology are the added upgrades.<br /><br />***Adding to this review with great disappointment in regard to Amazon's trade in policy.  I have chosen to return the FireTV cube.  I would regret holding onto the device due to its mediocrity.  Amazon does not permit the reuse of the trade in value or provide any recuperation of the value of the trade in.  I will be -1 device at the completion of the return.

145,862603,5,So fun to use. Impressive zoom,"This is so fun. I cannot believe the things I am able to see, and how close up I can get to them.<br /><br />The attachment is really well thought out allowing me to attach and look through any of the lenses on my iPhone 13 Max Pro. The mini tripod is also extremely handy. I use this constantly even when not using the monocular.<br /><br />One of the coolest things I noticed about this was when I was filming in a heavily wooded area. I was able to zoom in on a squirrel and must have been 200ft away, and then also zoom out, and focus in on a spider web between the trees that was about 30 feet in front if me. The spider web had enough detail where I could make out the dew on it.<br /><br />Another really cool thing I did with this is zoomed into the clouds. They seemed impossibly far away, but looking back at the footage I was able to see a bird soaring around up there that wasnt even visible to my naked eye.<br /><br />One thing I will say though, is that this seemed to perform better when filming under the trees in the shade. When I brought it out to the beach, it still filmed very nicely, but it was better with the sun to my bad. I think if the sun hits the lens directly it can cause some extra colors, or unwanted effects.<br /><br />This is very fun for just messing around, but could also go a very long way with a nice tripod too.",[],B0BFGTKKKY,B0BZVHP68H,AG3Z7W7B7GJRGSFLXDXPSPPHLX2A,2023-04-22 20:49:36.005,1,False,0.013410727493464947

They look similar to connections provided with other cameras but there doesn't seem to be a standard for these 4-pin ""micro DIN"" connectors. This unfortunately makes the screen useless without the included camera. If you're thinking about wiring this up to some other video source, it won't work.

I have been using my Remarkable2 tablet for several years and absolutely love it. The one feature I wish it had was to download my books. I suppose you can on the Remarkable2 but it’s a lot of trouble and as far as I know doesn’t support kindle.<br />Anyway, I preordered this back in September and received it a week before Christmas. I already have a bad taste in my mouth due to the price drop and not being refunded the difference but I digress.<br /><br />I do like the bigger Kindle screen however it’s a little too cumbersome to travel with. I like to throw my kindle in my purse or my bag so I can read while I’m waiting for appointments or on my lunch break. The scribe is too big for that or at least in my opinion.<br /><br />My heartache comes from the notebook itself. My remarkable allows me to create multiple folders and notebooks, so far I haven’t found that feature on Kindle. It writes ok, but I wish there were more options for the type of pen I wanted to use. Remarkable has a highlighter, calligraphy, pencil, thin, medium and thick options. Kindle scribe is very limited.<br />I was hoping that Kindle would give us the option to make notes right on the page but it doesn’t, you have to create a sticky note and then it saves the notes to a separate book in your library. Which is fine I guess but if I download a workbook, I would like to have the option to write on those pages instead of having to continue to make notes on a separate page.<br />To sum it up, I won’t return this because I do like the bigger screen for reading but I’m also having a bit of buyers remorse. If you are looking for an E Ink tablet to replace paper then spend the hundred extra dollars or so and buy the Remarkable2.<br />Hopefully Amazon is reading these reviews and will take note when doing a software upgrade.",[],B09BS26B8B,B0BDSVYL1Z,AENGDIH3LDDAFB6UIKMQ7WDZQ4VA,2023-01-13 12:42:27.604,4,True,0.007417275104671717

426,11790,5,One of the best prelubed switch options,"Just to provide some more context on these switches:<br /><br />These are clearly Haimu-made switches using their customary Nylon blend for both the top and bottom housing, and their POM blend for the stems. The factory prelube for a lot of these Haimu switches and other such as the Zuoce Rococo, the Haimu x Geon switches, and the Moondrop switches is pretty solid and smooth, and they're one of the few prelubed switches that are basically good to go right out of the box. The Browns here are NOT a light tactile but more of a med-heavy tactile, and all of Haimu's tactiles have a relatively sharper P-shaped bump rather than a longer D-shaped bump. Haimu's plastic blend also gives their switches a higher pitched sound profile in comparison to a lot of other switches. Finally, since these are Haimus, the silent Linear and Silent Tactiles here also have their slotted stem leg design and holes in the bottom housing to minimize the sound. These can also be found on the Haimu Heartbeat and Whisper switches. I mention all of this to basically note that Haimu is kinda a one-trick pony right now, but the trick is a very good one. Pick your Haimu switches based on things like spring weighting, accessibility (these being on Amazon with Prime shipping makes them super accessible), maybe even color scheme, whatever. But know that for the most part, any Haimu switch you get is going to have similar sound profiles and similar stock smoothness. Hope this helps!",[],B0BHWJXGK5,B09Q8LQ74Y,AEZ5SQ2SSSXOCFT6O52MSTBGEP4Q,2023-01-04 17:31:22.835,10,True,0.004423807840794325

456,820403,4,Good wireless headset little over dialed in highs,"I have the TH10 so I thought I would try these TH11. I was thinking they were the better of the two because of the higher number. But actually these have a 40mm speaker and the TH10 has a 50mm speaker.<br /><br />Thankfully they both sound  basically identical which is odd. Notice I said thankfully. That's because the TH10s headset is a bit tight on my head. Whereas these TH11 have less tight hold and around the ears they have more cushion and it's much softer.  So even though these have 10mm smaller speakers I think I'll use these since they sound the same.<br /><br />Just like the other model this Bluetooth tv headset comes with plenty of options to hook it up. And set up is very easy. It is very much plug and play.<br /><br />I am pretty sure both the TH10 and TH11 use the exact same transmitter box. That's not a bad thing because the transmitter works flawlessly. No static or drop outs. And the range is excellent. I can walk to the kitchen, bathroom, all over and keep the signal.<br /><br />The reason for four stars instead of five is only because these like the other model have the highs dialed in a little to much. I have another brand that has small in-ear earbuds and they seem to have more bass and the highs are more balanced. But these work perfectly fine. And I feel over ear headphones are a bit healthier for the ears then having ear buds plugged down in them every night.

With the lack of dedicated graphics hardware, don't expect to play PS3 games or AAA titles through Steam or the like.  Just not going to happen.<br /><br />My only gripe is the Wifi.

640,420456,5,Very solid board.,"The MSI z790i is probably the best ITX Z board money can buy.  It helps overclocking your cpu and ram really well.  The shortcuts to UV and OC are really handy especially for those less technologically saavy and want the best efficiency or performance with a few clicks.  There is a small fan and it is not obnoxious like other motherboards.  The temps for components on the board are well within spec and the worst is the PCH usually in the 60s and 70s.  I definitely recommend this board over the ROG strix z790 due to the daughterboard issues, the clunky hive module many do not like and the price of it is clearly not competitive for the features presented.  OTOH the MSI z790i is priced very nice and will get you going where you need to go quick.<br /><br />If I had one gripe with this board is I wished the connections were placed different or at least a little more easily accessible.  ITX boards can be challenging in a SFF build and say having all the fan headers placed close together AND in a spot where it's easy to reach all 3 would have been much nicer but that is the price paid for ITX.  Also, XMP has had no problems or hiccups whatsoever.  Once trained boot is quick especially if you're using a high quality gen 4 drive.  You'll be asking yourself what sorcery is this when it boots in ~15 seconds or games where you used to have to wait about 15-20 seconds will load in less than 5 seconds.  The other minor grip I have is I wished the theme of this board more closely resembled that of the MSI z690i.  That board looks very nice.  The silvery whiteness of this board can throw a big wrench into your black themed build.<br /><br />Nonetheless, if you're on the fence about a Z series board this is the one to get, especially if you don't know how to UV.  If you're on the fence between this and a B series board, MSI or Asus might be up your alley if you want to save some money so you can get a better gpu.  Mind you, B boards cannot OC and UV'ing will have to be done manually and most of the guides are for the Asus B boards.

There was one time where an airpod slipped out of my ear and fell under the treadmill so I had to stop working out just to go grab the AirPod.<br /><br />It’s rather annoying because I bought these tips to replace the ones that Apple gives you with the AirPods. Unfortunately, these did not do any justice because the pieces are a bit too small for my ears and thus the AirPods still continue to fall out. I wish they could make these in a bigger size so that I wouldn’t have to worry about my AirPod slipping out every time I’m doing exercise. It’s a shame that by now after all these years, Apple has not come up with a better product, or at least some sort of attachment that we can use to prevent the AirPods from falling out.

I have already confirmed no change in temps for my GPU.<br />*Bridge cable appears to be decent quality and is also flexible enough to move around a little.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*If you have a current gen GPU (RTX 4000 series in particular) you are definitely going to lose the rear fan slot - look at my pic (thats an MSI gaming trio RTX 4070ti).  The rear fan doesn't even come close to fitting with my GPU.  I could install the fan on the outside of the case, that is actually an option and there is a slot to get the fan wires back through into the case, but I'm not sure yet if I want to do that or how it would look.<br />*One of the tabs on the left side of the mount (that interlocks with the case) is located where the mobo I/O shield is.  This shouldn't be there because it actually interferes with installation.  I had to flatten it out with pliers to get it to install correctly.  I guess it would install right if you put this mount in BEFORE your motherboard install, but otherwise it doesn't.<br />*Its expensive for what it is.  There are a lot of whole cases that don't cost this much.  But if you have a O11 mini and you like the look, its worth having the one that is made specifically for this case.<br /><br />NOTE: Depending on your GPU you may have to loosen the little screws holding the PCIe port down to the bottom plate, mine was too far back and the GPU wouldn't mount up properly.  For a second I thought it wasn't going to fit, but luckily the port position can be slid forward/backward by a few millimeters as needed.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71K-eTOyn3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71K-eTOyn3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71K-eTOyn3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08TRB3672,B096M9B19G,AGB7XMIOA356ZM537X7ASL56R7XQ,2023-02-02 02:04:44.423,1,True,0.004472355358302593

To be clear, I had this installed by a professional - I saw other reviews where people said that the actual installation was difficult, but my guy had no issue.

The adhesive looks good and no problems.  Heat transfer also looks good with the LEDs running nice and cool.<br /><br />On a side note, it does say to use the entire tube once opened.  I didn't need the full tube for the LEDs though.  I just made sure that there wasn't any air in the tube and re-capped.

848,93810,5,"The Points Guy: Quick Tips, Help, Info - Surprisingly Astonishing","Hopefully this helps you!!! I like to rate items I buy as a review and give any helpful tips I was able to piece together to help the next person.<br />Glad to say this was a great buy. All in all was happy with my purchase and that’s saying something as I’m a very picky buyer. I pay for something and I want it to be worth it. I figure if I use my time to earn money then I’m paying for items with time so how much of my time is something worth. For example if 8 hours of work equal $250 and an item cost $250, to me it is equivalent to 8 hours of my life I’m never getting back. Electricity bill is equal to a days worth of work and mortgage is equal to 11 days worth of work and so on.<br />This is one of those things that’s worth every minute of work I had to trade to buy it. Don’t think you will regret buying if you do.<br /><br />The packaging is A1. Comes with every cord you'll need for setup connection with a monitor or console and even comes with a screen protector when not in use.

895,198942,4,A back zipper pocket for wallet and cellphone,"This backpack:<br />- Front size has 3 zipper pockets and 1 pocket (with 2 buckets); The thing that puzzles me is why are there 2 buckets in one of the front pockets. No zipper there, just a flap down pocket with 2 buckets. In my personal option, Velcro may be more ideal instead of buckets.<br /><br />- Right and left size each has a pocket for water bottle or small umbrella. These pockets are not netted but sewed together by a solid fabric. This appears to be sturdier than netted one.<br /><br />- Inside has 1 zipper pocket, laptop pocket, and 2 medium size pockets for notebooks/pens etc. The material separating the laptop pocket and the main compartment appears to be thinner than my other backpack. Not sure how much protection it can provide for the laptop.<br /><br />- Back has a zipper pocket for wallet, cellphone, etc. This is by far my favorite part. This pocket is almost half the height of the backpack, thus, a lots of small value items can put here.<br /><br />- Total of 7 buckets (2 in front, 4 on the side and 1 on the back) which add a little extra weight.<br /><br />- The paddling on the strap seems a little thin when compared to my other backpacks.

Comes with a bunch of little attachments of vary length that you can use to create a narrower and more powerful blast.  It absolutely is great for blowing out tiny spaces (inside dusty computers, etc), and has a wide attachment that can be used to inflate something like a pool float!  I don't have a technical measure of force, but it is significantly more powerful than a hair dryer (for example), and with the small sized nozzles it almost hurts to ""air nozzle"" your skin.  Even more useful to me is the vacuum feature, which I need for my cars (especially to get in between seats / etc.).  My only wish is that the vacuum attachment was a little longer, but it is long enough to work well for 98% of the carpet spots in my cars.

927,952731,5,Works fine.  Fits snugly in some keystone mounts,They get the job done and work fine.  I like how you don't need to buy a tool for a one time job.  Basically you strip back the cat5 or cat6 wire and wire using the  typology on the back of the keystone.  Once you get the wires organized then just push down the lever and it has a couple catches on each wire to ensure 100% connectivity.  The keystone plates that I picked up work but they are very snug and will take a bit of force to snap in place.  Overall they work fine and do the job.  Also a really great value over other cat6 keystone jacks plus toolless as well which was a big reason why I got these. If there is a problem with the wire all you need to do is simply lift the lever and redo the wire again and clamp it back down.  Very happy with these and easy to use.  Great value and price point for a 10 pack.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NHQhmU5KL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NHQhmU5KL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NHQhmU5KL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BNQPRR82,B0BR3V89TZ,AHRSODUSP52WWQH4XOHM6QS3IX5A,2023-03-23 15:58:16.599,0,False,0.02443533018231392

I found it to be an easy install and a perfect OEM style fit and finish! I found when using the included tool the process was not much more involved than  replacing a cell phone case. You use the tool to snap the old pads off.

I end up either having to flip the cover closed or lean the iPad forward and try to sneak it over the top, both of which inevitably mess up what I have onscreen.
