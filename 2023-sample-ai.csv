806554,5,"A basic, but fun little mouse that is absolutely worth it","How much should a computer mouse cost? If I was asked this question a week ago, I'd probably estimate about $10-$15 for a basic mouse, and I could even imagine $20-$30 (or even more) for a super fancy, 20-button, ergonomic, ultra-responsive space mouse. At the time of this review, this mouse is $5. That price would be understandable if this was one of those old school non-optical, trackball mice (with the ball at the bottom). But this mouse is sleek...it's rechargeable (via included micro-USB...though I would prefer if it was the more popular USB-C)...it can be connected with Bluetooth or USB receiver (I've tried both, and they are responsive and without issues, so far)...it changes LED colors...and it's silent. Admittedly, this is not a particularly high-end mouse. For example, there is no forward-back option, there are no programming buttons, it's not shaped with the ergonomic curves, and the scroll wheel is not textured (which I prefer over a smooth one). This mouse is an attractive matte color, it is very portable/low-height, it has 3 DPI levels (nothing too sensitive, but more than adequate for my needs), and both the left and right click buttons are fairly quiet. Functionally, it glides smoothly on my Roccat mousepad, and I have had no issues with connectivity yet.

525611,3,Issue with getting Motorola product support,"Unit was very easy to install and set up. I have had this unit for approx. 4 months. Was working very well until the last 3 weeks. We started dropping the internet signal intermittently . It would reboot automatically. I contacted Xfinity about this issue since they are my provider. They were very good about trying to fix the issue. They installed a signal monitor for several days and found that it was a problem with this modem. It has a 2 year warranty through Motorola. At this time I am having some difficulty reaching them for support. Hopefully it will get replaced.<br /><br />Wanted to add some info: I had contact with motorola support. I had to send them reports from the modem. They told me that some of my bonded channels had too much power and was out of range for the modem. my internet provider had been to my residence and placed a signal monitor on for a few days after checking that all connections were good. It showed that the signals and power levels were all within their parameters. My xfinity tech sent me the report which I sent to the motorola tech. I was wanting them to replace it and I would try another unit but now I am just stuck with the Motorola tech saying that their equipment is fine.

They installed a signal monitor for several days and found that it was a problem with this modem. It has a 2 year warranty through Motorola. At this time I am having some difficulty reaching them for support. Hopefully it will get replaced.<br /><br />Wanted to add some info: I had contact with motorola support. I had to send them reports from the modem. They told me that some of my bonded channels had too much power and was out of range for the modem. my internet provider had been to my residence and placed a signal monitor on for a few days after checking that all connections were good. It showed that the signals and power levels were all within their parameters. My xfinity tech sent me the report which I sent to the motorola tech.

504783,5,MINI-TRIPOD Review,"This review is for the mini-tripod for $15.99, not the current product of web cam. The seller should not re-use product pages because they might get bad reviews for one product and good reviews for the other, then both products would get combined mediocre reviews.<br /><br />The mini tripod is fantastic.

775495,4,Nice camera and screen but proprietary connections all around,"This kit is designed to give you a camera for your car or truck when you don't have a built-in screen.<br /><br />The camera mounts to standard license plate holes (once you figure out how to run a wire into the trunk). There are white ""night vision"" LEDs attached to the camera and they turn on and off automatically based on the brightness. The camera image is clear and colorful, obviously don't expect HD quality.<br /><br />The screen is a variant of the ubiquitous mini LCDs you can find. It's decently clear and has some settings to configure the image, including the usual brightness/contrast and several mirror/flip settings which you would need depending on which way you face the included camera. There is a windshield suction cup mount as well as a screw-on mount provided in the box.<br /><br />Connections between the screen and camera are proprietary.

11790,5,One of the best prelubed switch options,"Just to provide some more context on these switches:<br /><br />These are clearly Haimu-made switches using their customary Nylon blend for both the top and bottom housing, and their POM blend for the stems. The factory prelube for a lot of these Haimu switches and other such as the Zuoce Rococo, the Haimu x Geon switches, and the Moondrop switches is pretty solid and smooth, and they're one of the few prelubed switches that are basically good to go right out of the box. The Browns here are NOT a light tactile but more of a med-heavy tactile, and all of Haimu's tactiles have a relatively sharper P-shaped bump rather than a longer D-shaped bump. Haimu's plastic blend also gives their switches a higher pitched sound profile in comparison to a lot of other switches. Finally, since these are Haimus, the silent Linear and Silent Tactiles here also have their slotted stem leg design and holes in the bottom housing to minimize the sound. These can also be found on the Haimu Heartbeat and Whisper switches. I mention all of this to basically note that Haimu is kinda a one-trick pony right now, but the trick is a very good one. Pick your Haimu switches based on things like spring weighting, accessibility (these being on Amazon with Prime shipping makes them super accessible), maybe even color scheme, whatever.

420456,5,Very solid board.,"The MSI z790i is probably the best ITX Z board money can buy.  It helps overclocking your cpu and ram really well.  The shortcuts to UV and OC are really handy especially for those less technologically saavy and want the best efficiency or performance with a few clicks.  There is a small fan and it is not obnoxious like other motherboards.  The temps for components on the board are well within spec and the worst is the PCH usually in the 60s and 70s.  I definitely recommend this board over the ROG strix z790 due to the daughterboard issues, the clunky hive module many do not like and the price of it is clearly not competitive for the features presented.  OTOH the MSI z790i is priced very nice and will get you going where you need to go quick.<br /><br />If I had one gripe with this board is I wished the connections were placed different or at least a little more easily accessible.  ITX boards can be challenging in a SFF build and say having all the fan headers placed close together AND in a spot where it's easy to reach all 3 would have been much nicer but that is the price paid for ITX.  Also, XMP has had no problems or hiccups whatsoever.  Once trained boot is quick especially if you're using a high quality gen 4 drive.  You'll be asking yourself what sorcery is this when it boots in ~15 seconds or games where you used to have to wait about 15-20 seconds will load in less than 5 seconds.  The other minor grip I have is I wished the theme of this board more closely resembled that of the MSI z690i.  That board looks very nice.  The silvery whiteness of this board can throw a big wrench into your black themed build.<br /><br />Nonetheless, if you're on the fence about a Z series board this is the one to get, especially if you don't know how to UV.  If you're on the fence between this and a B series board, MSI or Asus might be up your alley if you want to save some money so you can get a better gpu.

It can also be charged via a power bank and can be used while charging if need be. The light itself is pretty bright and I have been using this a lot when filming and taking photos. It's very easy to use and operate. There a are a lot of different ways to use this and mounting is very easy and versatile with the included mini tripod and the built in magnets. The tripod is very well made and also fits easily into the carry case. The magnets are very strong and I had no fear of the light falling when in use.

708041,5,Great earbuds for the price,Recently my niece teen had lost/got stolen her Apple AirPods she had got for Christmas and she wasn’t getting another set.

I’m not saying they are better or anything like that. But she told me that she loved these and the fact that she could control right from the earbuds.  She loved how easy it was to connect to her phone as well. She loved how they fit in her ears and had no complaints so far.<br /><br />These are a decent price and definitely lower than Apple if not half the price. I can’t see myself paying top dollar for name brands for something so small that can be stolen so easily or lost. Especially when a teen owns them.

Now I am outside the 1-month return window and can't find any way to contact the seller to explain the issue or ask for an exception to the return policy.<br /><br />It is unfortunate, because the headphones fit well and the sound is fine.  I previously had a pair that lasted almost a year, but since then every unit I've received has been junk."",""id"":18287471}}"

I'm sure these will last me for years, but I'd definitely buy again, if I needed another set. It should be noted that I'm using them for my work computer, so my needs are specific. I turn off the computer every night, and use it only for work, so I don't have any idea about the sleep mode or gaming use, but for my purpose, these are great."",""id"":18287499}}"

458803,4,Nice Radio,"I bought this bc it looked rugged and has weather band and short band capabilities.<br />Once I received it however, it wasn't so rugged. It's all plastic and and ""rugged"" features are purely cosmetic.<br />I was honestly impressed with the sound. You don't expect the clarity and volume to come from this radio. I tried FM radio and I connected my phone via Bluetooth. It's definitely louder than my phone.<br />I tried using the short wave but I didn't have any luck. I have a list of all short band stations but I couldn't pick them up. The radio comes with a coil of wire to aid in better reception.

Once you get the wires organized then just push down the lever and it has a couple catches on each wire to ensure 100% connectivity.  The keystone plates that I picked up work but they are very snug and will take a bit of force to snap in place.  Overall they work fine and do the job.  Also a really great value over other cat6 keystone jacks plus toolless as well which was a big reason why I got these.
