768733,5,"A little finicky, but it works! One PC (RTX 4090) to two TVs @ 4k 120 Hz HDR/VRR","I'm using this splitter to have my gaming PC drive two displays - a 50"" Samsung QN90B in the bedroom, and a 75"" Samsung Q90T in the living room. I want to be able to move between rooms without changing connections on my GPU or fiddling around with Windows 11 multi-monitor annoyances.<br /><br />4 stars instead of 5 because it was fiddly to get working and it's a fairly expensive piece of kit. That may be the fault of HDMI tech in general, but I still didn't expect to spend an afternoon troubleshooting this for the money. Had to fully power down everything and try different boot sequences between the TVs / PC / Splitter, as well as different points in the sequence to switch the TVs into ""game mode"", before I managed to get both TVs to accept a 4k120 Hz HDR/VRR signal, but I eventually got it working.<br /><br />In case it's ever of use to anyone else, my setup worked with the following order:<br />Use the less capable TV (the Q90T) as ""OUT1"", the more capable TV (the QN90B) as ""OUT2"", with EDID set to ""Copy"" and OUT2 output at 4k<br />Shut everything down<br />Power the splitter<br />Power the two TVs, any order<br />Power the PC<br />Wait for signal on the Q90T (OUT1), switch it to ""Game Mode"" once there is signal and confirm 4k120 HDR/VRR<br />If no signal on QN90B (OUT2), manually toggle ""Game Mode"" setting to get signal. If this fails, go back to step 1 and repeat until success (I never had to attempt more than twice).<br /><br />Only other downside is that I can't make use of the 144 Hz refresh rate on my Samsung QN90B, but I'm OK with that; the difference between 120 HZ and 144 Hz is minor, and I didn't expect to be able to run two displays at different refresh rates off a splitter.<br /><br />--EDIT - Now 5 Stars!--<br />I contacted support, and they promptly provided updated firmware which resolved all my issues getting both TVs to accept signal. I now have 4k 120 Hz VRR/HDR on both screens with zero hassles from this adapter. Great stuff!",[],B0B5ZQK9BZ,B0B5ZQK9BZ,AETH2D76KIEXTOSL4RO5AHSYWRAA,2023-02-14 20:54:09.586,2,True,512
578781,5,A very good camera on the price-performance scale,"Ok, I have to admit I’m getting to be a fan of SV3C.  This is the third camera I have purchased from them for various rental properties, and this PTZ security camera is spot-on when it comes to performance vs. cost.<br /><br />Right out of the box the installation process was a breeze. The camera comes with everything you need to get it set up, including mounting hardware and power cable/adaptor – you just supply the ladder.  I had it connected to my WiFi network in minutes, so it went from box to live feed on my phone in less than an hour.<br /><br />The PTZ (pan, tilt, zoom) functionality on this camera is top notch. It lets me easily control the camera from my phone and move it around to get a better view of the area being monitored.  This camera is being used in the back of a rental property looking out for wildlife, specifically coyotes, and kids using ATV’s and motorcycles in my fields. With the PTZ feature, I can easily move the camera around to get a better view of the surrounding area, and with the cloud feature and motion detection, I can review film over the course of the day to find out in anyone is trespassing on my land.  Best of all, the camera can be set to follow an object as it moves across the field of view, set off an alarm, and/or turn on a light.<br /><br />The image quality of the camera is also excellent, especially the smart full-color night vision (when motion is detected). It has 5 megapixel HD resolution, which means the video footage is crystal clear even when digitally zoomed in. The camera rotates 355 degrees, which allows it to capture an entire six acres from one vantage point on my barn. In terms of durability, the camera seems to be very well-made. It already had its first battle against the weather – almost 3” of rain – and came out without fogging up or other issues.  This is critical for Massachusetts as we can get some rather extreme weather at times.<br /><br />Overall, I’m extremely happy with this latest PTZ security camera from SV3C. It is a high-quality product that’s easy to install and use, and it provides excellent image quality and coverage. I would definitely recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable security camera at an affordable price.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DOjKIV-YL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DOjKIV-YL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DOjKIV-YL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lbrp6Nl0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lbrp6Nl0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lbrp6Nl0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qaLHTNUYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qaLHTNUYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qaLHTNUYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BGHWFMNZ,B0BGHWFMNZ,AG5IPWIIC4KCRZ6DWNPJWJPZBJ2Q,2023-01-04 14:35:44.857,4,True,512
98291,5,A nice heads-up display,"I was not sure about this thing when we ordered it. In the box are the display with a long cord with plug ends on it, a tool to open a panel in the car, and some instructions.  It was nice that it came with the tool. Installing this thing was really easy. I even was able to install it while the car was still in the garage…not a lot of space to open the doors all the way. I needed a flashlight, and that was it. You open the panel on the back of the center console from the back seat. There is only one cable there with a connector.  You undo this connector and then connect the cable with the new display to it. The connectors only fit in one way, so you can’t mess this up. Then you just run the cable along the driver side to the front. You wedge it into the air vent centered behind the steering wheel. I was a little skeptical about this and thought it would come out, but it is a good fit. Nothing gets damaged…no screws or glue or double sided tape which is nice. Remember the cord comes out the RIGHT side of the display and goes behind it to the left. If you do not do this it will be upside down. After this is in and centered, tuck the cord in. I tucked it in around the side plastic trim and then under the floor mats in the back. You only see the cord in two spots. You see it right where it comes out of the air vent and goes over to the side panel for about 2 inches and then you see 1 inch of it right where it goes from the back of the driver’s seat to the center console near the base. Not too bad. I like how I did not have to take 1/2 the car apart to hide this cord. I also like that the display changes light intensity to match the light intensity of the normal display screen. This is nice for night and day driving, so you can see it but it is not blinding. It has turn signals, speed, seatbelt warning, and gear. When the car is stopped it will tell you battery percent. I am glad I got this thing.  I will say, the instructions it comes with are not really good. The pictures are so small you have no idea what you are looking at. Seriously, just look at the video on Amazon.  It is way more instructive than the instructions that are included. Aside from crummy instructions, this thing",[],B0BNJTG5R4,B0BNJTG5R4,AHKVIZZ7ILOTEGQ5TZ2NVNGOESBA,2023-02-26 14:41:47.457,0,False,512
260353,5,"Quality Optical Components, Bright & Clear Images,","If you've been looking for a quality monocular, this model is a great choice for the price.  It's rated at 10 x 42.  Objects viewed will appear 10 times closer.  The 42 refers to the size in millimeters of the large glass lens at the end of the scope.  The larger the outer lens is, the more light that can enter resulting in a brighter object being viewed.  I was impressed with this monocular's internal construction using high quality glass BAK4 prisms and FMC coatings.  These two features are typically found on higher-end optical devices and the end result is clearer and brighter images.<br /><br />But as this monocular is designed for outdoor use, the chamber is encased in a thick, rubberized coating which is rated at IPX7 waterproof.  An IPX7 rating means the device can physically survive a dunk in water 2-3' deep but not if immersed in flowing water or driving wind and rain conditions when force is involved.<br /><br />I like many design features such as the small supplied insert that screws into the 1/4-20 tripod socket beneath the scope.  A supplied wrist lanyard can be looped into this insert adding a little extra safety when handling the device.  A small tripod is also included and is good for desktop use especially when viewing objects near eye level.  If you're looking at birds overhead or stars at night, I recommend using a monopod or tripod to help steady the view.  Ten power is about the maximum you can hand-hold and external stabilization is always a big help.  The scope also comes with a phone holder allowing you to take photographs through the lens.  I've included a photo but due to cloudy skies at night, I haven't been able to take a picture of the moon yet. Comes with handy small tripod, carrying pouch, wrist lanyard, durable lens covers.  Easy to focus with large knurled knob.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Monoculars by design are a cross between a spotting scope, binocular and telescope.  This one juggles the constraints of each one and in the end, is versatile, durable and optically accurate.  I think it works best in combination with a monopod for birding and general observation.  For star gazing or when using it as a spotting scope, you'll want a tripod.  Rugged design and waterproof makes it good for camping or the beach.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61F-xqK44LL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61F-xqK44LL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61F-xqK44LL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VeEpWb7wL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VeEpWb7wL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VeEpWb7wL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XwGv58k7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XwGv58k7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XwGv58k7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DKYCFDBxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DKYCFDBxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DKYCFDBxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dr6WFsJRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dr6WFsJRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dr6WFsJRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kBZrqrmCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kBZrqrmCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kBZrqrmCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BTNQLYJJ,B0BTNQLYJJ,AFN7TLKO5YF2DGRTUSGXQVCKS3FA,2023-02-19 05:43:59.979,0,False,512
680939,5,Wonderful Indoor Security Camera!,"Hey everyone! It's your favorite Amazon reviewer, Sean 'The Tester' Chao, back again with a new product! Today we're looking at blurams' Security Camera 2K.<br /><br />- Build: This product is very well-made.  The material used is hard, durable plastic.  The moving components, to include the swivel, does so seamlessly.  Our inspection did not identify any manufacturer defect with our test product, nor did we find any notable design flaw.  We assess that this product will last 3+ years if treated with proper care.<br />- Price: At the time of writing, this product is priced comparably to similar products on the market. The indoor security camera  niche is highly saturated, and we observed comparable products coming in at both lower and higher price points.  However, this product differentiates itself with an exceptional in-house app support, high resolution imagery, multiple practical features (e.g. two-way chatting, siren, motion detection), and 360 degree swivel. Additionally, blurams is an established brand, thereby commanding it a premium price when compared to many of its competitors.  For this reason, we consider this product to be a great value.<br />- Function: This product works as intended. We were able to use the blurams app to control the camera without any issue.  We do note that the initial pairing process does take a few attempts, particularly with the camera reading the QR code to sync into the account.  Beyond that initial sync process, though, we were very satisfied with the control and cloud recording for this device.  We'd like to note that the app alone makes this a worthwhile investment, as it is a very polished product, and becomes even more so as you add more blurams products to your home.<br />- Aesthetics: This product is compact and is unassuming when placed in the background.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a great security camera.  It is compact, packed with features, and is priced competitively.  We therefore recommend this to anyone looking for this type of product.<br /><br />This product earns the 'Sean's Supreme Seal.'<br /><br />**Seals are rated on this scale**<br />Poor: No Seal<br />Average: 'Sean's Satisfactory Seal'<br />Good: ""Sean's Superior Seal'<br />Excellent: ""Sean's Supreme Seal'",[],B0B7J3ZQQ1,B0B7J3ZQQ1,AEUUTS44JD7LRSSA53ZDZINXYJWQ,2023-02-17 18:52:41.887,0,False,512

376299,4,Nice earbuds - wish play time was just a bit longer,I’ve looked at enough earbuds these days to have developed what is for me a good set of criteria to judge them and only one of those criteria is how they sound.<br /><br />1) How they sound – of course this is important!<br />These earbuds sound pretty good! Mostly that’s because they have sufficient bass something that is not common with earbuds that do not also have an equalizer app. These are by no means super-audiophile level earbuds but they do not disappoint like so many inexpensive earbuds do. These get a thumbs up on sound.<br /><br />2) Playing time<br />These earbuds are rated to last 5 hours before needing to go back into the case and they do last that long. That’s a little too short for me because I use them to help me sleep using Apple iPhone Background sounds (which is fantastic!) and I will literally wake up to the sound of the earbuds telling me to charge them. But it’s not terrible – I just pop in the other earbud and it’s back to zzzzz-ing.<br /><br />3) The case<br />The case with these earbuds opens easily and with sufficient clearance to make getting the earbuds out of the case easy. This is important because I have earbuds where the top of the case does not get far enough out of the way so you can get the darn things out! These earbuds also rest high enough out of their charging position so that there is plenty to grab to get them out. USB-C connection to charge it – check! I like the case.<br /><br />4) Fit<br />For me the earbuds mostly fit well but one slipped out a couple of times even after trying different ear tips. A little annoying but everyone is different and considering how many really good (and expensive) earbuds turn up in Lost-And-Found’s this is not an issue specific to this product.<br /><br />5) Overall<br />For me 5 stars means it’s a great product and only the somewhat limited play time bumps this down a notch. This will probably not make a difference for most people who listen on and off during the day and can pop the ‘buds back in the case for a top-off. I can easily recommend these.,[],B0BRBXN4PK,B0BZ3J6XD6,AEEKMQV4NEMRGSKAXHUKWWD2QT6Q,2023-03-24 22:48:25.060,0,False,512
859808,4,"Great SSD, but not much has changed","I'll start by saying that in terms of being fast, it's fast. If you come from a mechanic hard drive, it's like going from a horse carriage to a Lamborghini. Even from a SATA SSD, you'll feel some gains. If you currently have an M.2 ssd, unless you're doing very specific transfer tasks, you're not going to 'feel' a difference. Windows boot will be similar, and game loading will still be limited to the game developers optimization for pc. I upgraded from a 980 Pro, and knew I wouldn't see a difference, but I need it another SSD anyways. The reason this gets four stars is because of the fact that these should all be coming with heatsinks nowadays. The fact that I couldn't even purchase the heat sink version because of the sold out is so annoying. I would have had no problem paying an extra 10 or $20 for a heat sink but Samsung should have just made them all with heatsinks by default and show that they are truly a premium brand when it comes to solid state drives. So as you'd expect, it gets toasty and I see no difference in heat compared to the 980 pro, so Samsung gimmicky cooling solution nonsense on their website is just that, nonsense. The heatsink is what will make a difference, not their 'utting-edge thermal control algorithm technology'. As far as advertised speeds go, I typically get anywhere from 6500 to 6800 read and 5500 to 6500 write. That's typical as it's very rare that you'll get your SSD to push its top limits, and you're never going to feel a speed difference that small. Random read and random write speeds for benchmarking are all over the place, and these are the important speeds, but they fluctuates depending on heat and 8 million other factors going from bios settings to whatever windows is doing at any given time. All in all, it is the fastest SSD on the market and you can't go wrong, but if you're looking for a speed boost you're not going to see one coming from an M.2 drive. I would however consider upgrading from a pci 3.0 drive if you've made the switch to a pci 4.0 motherboard.  If you're able to get the heat sink version definitely 100% get it. Because of this card it's ridiculously hot. Not hot to wear it will get damaged, but hot enough to slow down speeds. Then again, it's still fast and it's Inferno conditions.",[],B0BHJF2VRN,B0C6N3GWW6,AFV2VENASG67HBBHI23QZTYATAHA,2023-03-25 11:26:12.479,18,True,512

751586,5,Does a Good Job!,"I recently used this kit on two different builds, one that was 6 years old and a new one.  It did a great job.<br /><br />Old Build:<br />The cleaner turned a dark blue/green color and was non-transparent after the 8 hours it ran through the loop.  Once it was rinsed and the Superflush run through for 24 hours, the PETG tubing and acrylic reservoir shined like new.  Both had become a little cloudy over the years but now they're clear.<br /><br />New Build:<br />Following the same process produced the same results.  The cleaner again, turned blue/green but this time was still transparent.  The GPU water-block top is clear acrylic, and even though it's a new block, I can see that the nickel channels are noticeably brighter.  All of the acrylic tubing and nickel parts gleam now.<br /><br />The instructions aren't on the bottles, so you'll want to download the manuals from EK.  In them it calls for a 15-minute rinse of the cleaner using the Superflush but to continue rinsing until all of the foam is gone then refill with Superflush and run for 24 hours.  That said, the cleaner foams a lot once you start flushing, so in my case it took several refill/rinse cycles and there wasn't enough Superflush mixture to use it for all of the rinse cycles.  So, I rinsed each loop for 15 minutes x2 with Superflush and for the remainder of the rinse cycles I used distilled water.  Once the foam was completely gone, I refilled with Superflush and let them run for 24 hours.<br /><br />One thing that happed in the new loop that didn't with the old one, flux washed out of one of the radiators and the sticky residue collected on the GPU water-block.  OCD got the best of me and I didn't trust that the Superflush would remove it, so once the rinse cycles were complete, I opened the GPU block and cleaned off the flux, but now I think the Superflush would have removed it.  The instructions state you might manually flush the radiators with the cleaner before they're installed but mine were already installed so it wasn't an option.<br /><br />After the cleaning, I refilled both loops with Cryofuel Clear and am very happy with the results.

It has feel of an item made oveseas for about $0.35 each in quantities of 100k.<br /><br />The seller claims the hub is compliant with USB v 3.0.

At 5 GB/s, data transmission rates can potentially reach 5 GHz.  The fact is that very few individuals will ever really more than a 250 MB/s data transfer rate, which is half of USB 2.0.<br /><br />Funny, right?  The hub is made so cheaply that I am sure there is no shielding, the cable is not shielded and there are no ferrites to knock down radiated noise from ""5 GHz,""  which unless you are using a true 10 GHz hardware backbone (like telecom), you have no chance that you will be sitting back in your easy-chair, patting yourself on the back for ""making it"" with the likes of Bill Gates or Michael Dell while watching five billion binary digits per second transfer 25 year-old ""B"" movies and other items that scream ""delete me.""

It does give an amazing quality image for the price though.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Has a great image quality during day and nighttime (didn't except such a good quality night time image for this price)<br />- Can add an SD card to store recordings on-device<br />- Small form-factor<br /><br />Cons:<br />- RTSP support was dropped and you have to use some old beta firmware that they no longer have on their website. As someone who hates cloud (if I was going to break into your house I will just jam your wifi and bam, you have no security video of the event) this was a huge bummer. The beta RTSP firmware does work but this should be an officially supported thing and it's really not hard to add. They just want to milk you for that cloud subscription.<br />- No ability to set static IP address. Huge bummer for a security camera.<br />- You can only configure this via their cloud app that requires internet and tracks everything you do.<br />- Forces you to install the mobile app to configure the device. As someone who is security conscious I absolutely hate mobile apps. Just give me a web interface I can access over my LAN.<br />- If the company cloud system goes down your camera is a fancy paper weight<br /><br />This device basically takes the shaver and blades model by selling the device at a loss (or barely any profit) and make it up in cloud subscription sales. I would totally pay an extra bit of money to get a device that doesn't require their cloud at all and lets you access the streams over the LAN from the camera.<br /><br />I enabled RTSP and blocked all internet access to the device from my router. This makes it as secure as it can get for now. I just hate that I can't configure the device now because the app has to use the internet to communicate with the camera. I will not be buying more of these products unless they change things.<br /><br />I would never use one of these for an actual security camera due to the above limitations. I am just using it to monitor my bearded dragon cage so it is fine. I will never buy one of these products again unless they change.",[],B08R59YH7W,B0C1VP1GGK,AE6REA76QJZQVSPZ2BTZ7PK3QMYA,2023-01-23 18:00:07.240,8,True,512
383745,5,Nice beginner to intermediate fitness tracker.  Lots of watch functions and records key trackers.,"This is a very nice fitness tracker for anyone in any age range looking to try their first watch/fitness tracker.  I wanted one because my doctor told me I need to increase my daily activity.  I got it mainly to track my daily steps, total walking distance, calories burned, and heart rate.  Which this does very well.  It also tracks other indicators as well.  You can link it to your phone and accept/reject calls, etc.  But, I mainly wanted to know how my activity levels are over time.  It seems to be accurate, but I couldn't really check scientifically.<br /><br />This tracker only takes a few minutes to setup and create an account for the App on your phone.  It has a lot of permissions and allows you to connect to many different social media accounts, which I didn't do.  It has a nice magnetic charge that you plug into any USB port and attach to the watch.  It also comes with a plastic screen protector you can attach.  There are a lot of different options you can set for the watch through the App, as well as a number of different watch faces to choose from.<br /><br />The watch and band are comfortable, but it can get a little warm after awhile, because it is just plastic.  But after using it for a week I hardly knew it is there anymore.  It has all of the functions available easily from the watch face.  This includes your email, phone, text, weather, etc.  Initially, I choose to setup the minimum options and not use it to make phone calls, etc.  I just wanted to see how well the health/fitness tracker information was at first.  But, after a couple weeks I added the ability to call/receive phone calls and text messages.  These are ""nice to have"" things and they worked well.  Making a call was easy and talking via the watches microphone worked surprisingly well.  (It made me think I was Maxwell Smart from the old TV show ""Get Smart."")<br /><br />Overall, I think it is a very good fitness tracker for the price.  The watch and App work well.  I didn't see any power drain on my phone's battery from the App or being linked to my phone all the time.  I would certainly recommend this watch/fitness tracker to anyone.  I think it would be great for a Middle School or High School student too.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L03y0YdsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L03y0YdsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L03y0YdsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cAQC1mVgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cAQC1mVgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cAQC1mVgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61f4FgcSL1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61f4FgcSL1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61f4FgcSL1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kFIQ+CiyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kFIQ+CiyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kFIQ+CiyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vtX6W59vL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vtX6W59vL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vtX6W59vL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xAa2+aSJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xAa2+aSJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xAa2+aSJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yFNF+yYjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yFNF+yYjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yFNF+yYjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yrdJOYa0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yrdJOYa0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yrdJOYa0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71C4OQPncpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71C4OQPncpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71C4OQPncpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BLN53WGB,B0BLN53WGB,AFS7VS3EUKQG5KFAMEQDEO5H5GEQ,2023-01-01 18:50:43.423,0,False,512
13496,2,Frustrating experience for a device that I love to pick up,"I had been watching the youtubes and the reddits to see how people like and use their Surface Duos.<br />At the price, I decided to pick up one up to use as a consumption device.<br />I love the geekiness of being able to open and close two screens without a crease, but I now can see the benefit of a seamless screen of the other folding devices.<br />The gap between the screens goes beyond hardware, Microsoft explicitly states that the gap extends to the os and software. If the app does not support dual screen or spanning, you will be missing content; text, videos, games, you name it.<br />Folks have mentioned the plastic of the case that is around the USB port is very thin and already is cracking, which is sadly a known issue with the first gen Surface Duo.<br />I like that I can use my two button Surface Pen with the purple cap. The writing is nice and clean on OneNote.<br />Would have been nice to have the camera on the back, but I don't use the camera on my regular phone enough and would use for document scanning at most, just make sure not to blind yourself by accidentally turning on the led flash.<br />USE the bumper case! The glass finish on the back is beautiful, but it gave me anxiety when placing on difference surfaces. The included bumper case gives a small amount of a lip to raise the glass back off the surface you place the phone on.<br />The OS is currently on Android 12, and is fine when in landscape mode. There are still bugs that make using two screen frustrating. The keyboard will usually show up on the correct screen text needs to be typed in to, but sometimes, the keyboard will resize and zoom in, or pop up on the other screen.<br />Rotating is an act of frustration, the accelerometer is too sensitive and will rotate incorrectly even when placing in laptop mode and placing on the table. I had to turn off auto rotate when I am WFH, as I want to use the device in laptop mode, but the screen will switch between landscape and portrait mode, even when I don't want it to. Other devices like android tablets and iPads work with no issue rotating the screen accordingly.<br />So, despite all these issues, why am I keeping the Surface Duo?<br />It's a good representation of what Microsoft was hoping a dual screen device would be; thin, light, multi-productivity, with Microsoft flair.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lji4NQkkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lji4NQkkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lji4NQkkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lsw5RIIuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lsw5RIIuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lsw5RIIuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tvNiQxdgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tvNiQxdgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tvNiQxdgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B094PPCP8V,B099FLM4W8,AF7DPBOL6KVPOXPODFA23IPZXTBA,2023-04-07 17:30:13.101,0,True,512
508486,4,Great but less portable than I hoped for,"This monitor is great. It's thin, light weight, the aluminum housing feels plenty strong and lends a reassuring rigidity to the monitor, the speakers are surprisingly not bad, and it comes with all the cables you need.<br />The picture quality is quite good - 1080p at 15.6"" is pretty ideal in my book. You don't have any weird scaling to deal with but you also don't have to squint to see anything. The colors are solid and look good. I wouldn't trust it for color accurate work but for watching a video it was quite good. The speakers were way better than I expected - I was playing sound from my 2017 workstation class laptop and the speakers sounded pretty comparable in quality. Not good enough for audio mixing but impressively decent for how thin the display is and for the fact that the speakers face away from you. The full size HDMI port means you'll never have to rely on a single cable and can instead use any regular HDMI cable which is a huge win and the two USB C ports, are both full function despite one being labelled for power only.<br /><br />Where I'm slightly disappointed is that for most devices I think you'll have to bring along more than just one USB C cable. I was able to power on the display but not have anything show up using both my phone and my Switch. Looking through the instructions they do recommend using both a power and data cable for nearly every use case. I did get it to power on and display an image with use a single USB C type cable plugged into a Thunderbolt 3 port but I would recommend always bringing the power brick with you just in case.<br />The downside of that is that the fabric sleeve doesn't have a pocket for the large power brick. Despite only needing a 5V 3A brick the included power brick is larger than some of my 40W USB PD charging bricks. And without a nice spot to store that massive brick in the sleeve, I find myself either tossing it in with the screen (far from ideal) or using another pocket in my backpack to bring the brick along. Certainly not a deal breaker and somewhere expected for a display without a battery but still disappointing.<br /><br />Overall this is a solid screen and I really do like it. It's a huge boon for mobile productivity and can even boost mobile entertainment thanks to it's halfway decent speakers (again, way better than I expected).  But if you want the most portable option, you'll probably want to look somewhere else",[],B0BW3FR9XJ,B0CCY3NK1Z,AHKKN6QCUWESPVFACIN3LHDWGBYA,2023-03-12 21:26:58.247,0,False,512
643018,1,"Terrible product, worse customer service, no real warranty","STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY AND ITS PRODUCTS. You get what you pay for could not be more accurate. I received the product with the drive already loose in the enclosure, and with much lower transfer speeds than advertised and expected. Two months later the drive is completely unreadable and cant be initialized, erased  or repaired by 4  operating systems and so loose in the housing a slight pull removed the whole thing.<br /><br />I contacted the company with photos explaining the situation, thinking clearly the photos show one of the two chips either arrived damaged or overheated. How else could you possible explain the giant plastic bubble with the chip solder moving and coming off. There's no way I could have added plastic to the chip. right? But unfortunately not.<br /><br />Initially they told me to ship it in (at my own expense which would be about 1/2 the price of the  product. But since I cant initialize the drive I can't wipe or encrypt it and was pretty sure there was personal data on it.<br /><br />They assured me they would shred it immediately..... implying I should trust the company who sent me this garbage and that I couldn't dispose of it myself. I responded saying I understand the policy but don't know why they would prefer I warn other customers on amazon instead of replacing it leaving a positive review,  creating a customer who probably would have purchased many more drives from them.<br /><br />The issue was escalated and instead of replacing the drive or just repeating that they couldn't make an exception to the ship in policy which would have been bad but at least understandable, THEY DECIDED TO DOUBLE DOWN AND  BLAME ME for their defective/overheating failed drive and said due to product damage they wouldn't even warranty it if I wanted to ship it to them.<br /><br />Pictures clearly show the damaged chip and solder with literally everything else undamaged, which I still cant't figure out how damage to specific parts and the solder under the chip could be caused by me.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this. Either spend the extra $10 for a Samsung or sandisk drive, with incredible durability, read/write speeds, and probably customer service who doesn't lie or if you're a risk taker without an extra $10 ,purchase this knowing the terrible quality of the product and the complete lack of reasonable customer service or and terms of their ""lifetime warranty"".","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ThQy3QaeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ThQy3QaeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ThQy3QaeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vkAMoe-LL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vkAMoe-LL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vkAMoe-LL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B091YV4JQN,B0BSN4FRW4,AEBY2VPN3AR6Y2KX6QGGKIVPE7CA,2023-03-12 16:19:10.785,3,True,512
321288,1,This Tracker is a No-hitter,"DOOGEE is Chinese manufacturer of budget and rugged smart phones. They have a good reputation for their class of products. I have never used any DOOGEE products, but considering my awareness of the brand, I ordered this fitness watch when I saw it was available. It arrived one day after the order was placed and it was nicely packaged. The watch uses the VeryFit App, claims waterproof level of 5ATM and has 14 sport modes, more than any other fitness watches that I have evaluated. The small, folded manual unfolded to reveal a quick start guide printed in 6 languages: English, Japanese, German, French, Spanish, and Italian. Went downhill from there.<br /><br />Strike 1. The guide included minimal information for Power-on/off, Charging, Download the App, and Pairing. No information about using any of the sport modes or general use of the watch. The watch prompts with a QR code to load the VeryFit App which is supposed to provide instruction for the Sport modes but not all 14 modes are listed in App. I was not impressed with the instructions provided.<br />Strike 2. To charge the watch the band must be removed from the bottom side of the face to expose a USB male connector that plugs into a USB Type A charger. Problem here was that I needed to look at the small image of the watch in the guide to determine the side band that needed removal. There is no text identification for which band needs removal. The band was so tightly attached to the watch that I could not pull it off by hand. Just would not budge and thought I was breaking the watch. I had to use a thin metal spreading tool to wedge the band from the watch but finally removed it and got to see the USB Charging plate. After 2 weeks of testing I still need to remove the band with a wedge. Just pulling at the band feels like it will break the watch or the band.<br />Strike 3. Due to the shape of the watch, when connected to a multi-port charger it blocked one of the other charging ports. Awkward way to charge the watch and prevents using any other type of band.<br /><br />Usually three strikes and you're out, but there's a multi-Strike 4. The screen is one of the smallest I've seen, the touch response is slow ,the screen display time is very short, and does not show the charge level.

147931,4,The Alexa App is terrible,"I love this product. I bought one echo dot 3, and immediately fell in love. I now own several of version 3 and several of version 5, along with a couple echo sow 5s. I love them all. Get one, or several. You won’t regret it. What I don’t like is the Alexa app. I’ve been programming computers since 1969, and have used every human interface imaginable, including punching in hex codes from the front panel while the machine was running. The Alexa app is, by far, the worst I have ever used. Yes, it’s even worse than punching in hex codes. It obviously was never designed. People just added stuff whenever they felt like it, without regard to anything that anyone else had done. For example, when you make a change, sometimes you have to save the change, sometimes it just happens immediately. You never know which is which. When you need to save, you never know where to look for the save button. Sometimes it’s at the top, sometimes it’s at the bottom, sometimes it’s big, sometimes it’s tiny and barely noticeable.  You will notice that you can display “all devices” from several locations, but the displays are all different, and there are things you can do from one display that you can’t from another. Good luck on remembering where you found the one you actually needed. And then there’s the “help” feature. Once you manage to find it, you’ll find lots of “make sure your device is plugged in” instructions and other brainless nonsense. There are occasional references to menu selections that don’t exist. Once you follow the instructions, you will find that nothing happens. This is not always the case, but it happens more often than not. This is because two or more features are working at cross purposes to one another. Apparently they were developed by two different groups that never talked to each other. The Alexa app needs to be redesigned from the ground up. The documentation needs to be thoroughly scrubbed. Sets of instructions need to be tested to make sure they actually work. Instructions need to be created for things that people actually want to do. No, I don’t want to order 25 tons of paper clips, and I don’t want you to tell me how to do it.

At any rate SmallRig offered me a full refund, but I asked for a replacement unit instead, because I do like the product, the 1st one just didn't last. So they sent me what looks like a refurbished replacement, I only ssy it looks refurbished because a couple of screws on the focus motor looked like they were rounded out a bit, like they had been removed and replaced.

186872,4,Very nice but expect to adapt to them,"At the time of this writing these are one of my favorite headphones to use! However it didn’t start out that way because they are different enough from regular headphones that I needed to adapt to their differences.<br />A. When I first received these I was disconcerted by the fact that they do not hold snug to the back of my head or neck which is what I was used to with regular types. They kind of flopped about and I was annoyed that I couldn’t wear my ponytail in certain ways without it interfering with the headphones. It really irritated me. With use however I got used to the fact that these need more room for movement in order to stay in the right position for bone conduction. Now I don’t even notice it.<br />B. I am starting to have low vision issues due to an eye condition. This made it hard for me to figure out what slots, tabs and buttons were for which function. As you can see in one of my photos, I accidentally ripped a button off the side while trying to figure out where the charging port was. I don’t know what that button was for, but the headphones work fine for me without it.<br />C. I had no idea what to expect from bone conduction sound. The sound quality was good enough that I didn’t know until reading about bone conduction headphones later that it can be an issue. I was miffed at first that others can hear what I am listening too. I thought these would make the sound private like with other headphones. I was also upset that I couldn’t hear people clearly in my environment like other reviews claim. I still need to pause my audio or take off the headphones if someone needs to speak to me. The sound needs to be really low for me to be able to have music going AND be able to hear others. This still confuses me, but it’s still slightly better than regular headphones. The other factor that may be playing a large part in my struggle here is that I have ADHD so it is ALWAYS hard for me to focus on two sound events at once. So it is likely not an issue with these headphones, but just an issue with my own brain. I just cannot have music going on in my ear if I am going to try to converse with and understand someone talking to me.

605089,4,Suction cup won't stick to the windshield,"This was  a gift from a friend, so I got to pick which dash cam I wanted, and I carefully spent over a week looking at different options, then settling for the Vanture Dash cam although it was at the top of our budget, I saw the reviews, but risked it anyway because their app had 3 stars unlike most dash cams out there with 2 or less stars,  I actually tried installing it, to be honest the features are a little confussing but not too complicated,  the camera would not stick to the windshield no matter what right out of the box, spent over a hour trying different things while losing sunlight, I needed the camera to work that day for an event, I was extremely disappointed, so I went to order some adhesive online, which is going to now take an extra 3 days for delivery, hopefully the hardwire kit is easy enough to install while I wait, otherwise I will return it, I liked the camera itself, but like many are saying if the camera won't stick to anything it is useless, I don't know about you, but in today's economy time is money, and I don't like waisting either!!!!!<br /><br />One last thing, the video looks REALLY good, but I noticed the angle in the front don't seem to cover the entire hood of my SUV, there are blind spots on each front sides, and I wanted a camera that I could view from the app ""while I was in my home or work"", but the app ONLY works if your within 6 meters or around 2 ft of the camera, maybe it will work once I get it to stick to the windshield and get a powerbank or install the hardwire,  I want to monitor the surroundings of my vehicle no matter where I am, if not I will return it,  People need to use the app when they are AWAY from the camera.  for the price being over $229 it should have a better suction cup or feature that makes it reliable, I feel cheated a little,  because of the headache it caused and the non transparency of the features, I think it is a good camera and maybe they are evolving to fix issues, I would recomenned this camera but be prepared to tweak it to your liking if you need features as I mentioned above.<br /><br />Update: I got the adhesive and mounted the camera to the windshield and so far I am very happy with the camera so I upgraded my star rating for the review.",[],B09LLLF8PG,B0BJJQQWKV,AE4CKJ45OLC2B75IYTY6O3TJXFDQ,2023-01-28 00:40:37.834,0,False,512
374201,4,Awesome high performance- low batterry life- colling fan bearing failures,"Im writing this review because I purchased this laptop on 03/22/2022. Today is March 1, 2023. I am two weeks away from having owned this pc for a year. The pros- super fast everything- awesome graphics- doesnt hurt the pocket as much as other gaming laptops. The cons? Battery life SUCKS- it is basically on an IV- you can adjust the settings but even on the optimal or silent condiotions, this CPU and GPU are so powerful they drain the battery in 2 hours or less- even when your not doing anything serios. Just using excel or word- battery drain. The only other con that i have that I ant pepl to be aware of- about 2 weeks ago I started having fan noise- bearings failing. I am now trying to find OEM replacements. This things spins fans at over 6000RPMs. . . yes, that is correct- 6000RPMs. I can not find fans that are rated for that high of RPMs and I need them before my PC melts down- I have always used a cooling pad as support and kept the guts clean and treated this ting like a newborn baby in terms of gentleness. It is just a parts issue- not a user/operator error. I am a MEchatronics Engineering Student and a programmer as well as a controls system specialost so my computer is my every day tool and with that said- my purposes demand quality and power as much as reliability and I take very good care of my equipment. This PC has not let me down- besides the fact that the fan bearings are barking now. I also want to mention that this little PC will support up to 4 extended displays wit hno issues, run multiple intense programs and take it  all with a beating- has never went over 70 degrees celcius and i rin this littlpe puppy overclocked to the max- hence the fan issue- however that is what this PC is meant/designed/built for. If anyone knows were i can find cooling fans PLEASE let me know. I really want to replace them with high performance fans and not just run of  the mill aftermarket general condition types fans. Thanks!!!!!! I deinately wisay that I do not think you will be dissapointed in your purchasse of this PC. Ii have only ""gamed"" on it once or twice- EVE Online and it performed flawlessly.

999335,2,Your New Earbuds May Not Work - AVOID!,"I've owned between three to four pairs of the Jabra Elite Active 65t over the last several years. They're great earbuds for working out, but with two usability complaints:<br /><br />1. After sweating a lot when working out the earbuds may fall off when your head is facing downwards (such as when doing a plank or pushups). Not a big deal in my case, as you can start feeling the earbuds loosening, so you can push them back in.<br /><br />2. Sometime when pulling the earbud out, the earpad would often get stuck in my ear. One time it was rather scary, as I couldn't get it out and a doctor needed a tool to remove it (He did gift me the tool in case it happened again, and probably a laugh he saved until I was out the door).<br /><br />Either way, if you're reading this, it's likely because the earbuds are more affordably priced as Jabra has made newer models since.<br /><br />Do NOT buy them.<br /><br />I bought a new pair as my original Active 65t could only remain on for a little over 30min after having owned them from 3-to-4 years, with its capacity to hold a charge slowly dwindling over time.<br /><br />I should have kept them.<br /><br />This new pair of earbuds would never turn on. Their LEDs would not show low battery, despite charging the case overnight. I got a replacement for another new-in-box pair, and the same issue occurred. Went through the same steps on Jabra's website to attempt to fix the issue, repeated them when dealing with customer service, at which point they told me to try to get an exchange.<br /><br />My uneducated guess is that this paid being a model several years old, and already having some battery issues with them in the past, their battery has simply died over time even if never used.<br /><br />At this point I just gave up and got the Beats Pro on an online recommendation. Took seconds to pair to my iPhone, and though I've only used them once so far, they work like a charm.<br /><br />Please note I also own the Jabra Elite 75t for regular home use, and they work just fine.<br /><br />Just avoid the Elite Active 65t.",[],B07BHF993Q,B08V47HYBW,AHHRTTWBY6FUYTFXW7REGJZLWD2A,2023-01-08 03:38:30.111,0,True,512
805440,4,"Nice Sound, Nice Price","In the world of BT speakers, you want several things.  Portability to take your music or podcasts with you.  Long play time.  You want the music to keep playing for as long as the party lasts.  Quality sound.  You want deep bass sound, nice highs and smooth undistorted vocals.  And among the most important, affordability.<br /><br />Well, congratulations, you've found the SBOSENT Bluetooth Portable Speaker and your bases are covered for not a lot of money.<br /><br />This speaker is rugged.  You can take it with you camping or hiking or to the beach or virtually anywhere.  It's built tough with a hard, rubberized coating that will protect your investment for a long time.  The speaker is water resistant and the seal that protects the speakers connections is tight and will resist everything except being submerged for an extended period of time.  Rain and splashes will bounce right off.<br /><br />In addition to the BT feature, the SBOSENT Bluetooth Portable Speaker can play music from an SD card, or  by way of AUX in cord (for devices that don't use BT technology) and it also has the ability to play FM radio, though I find that connecting the supplied AUX cord will serve as an antenna and allow for more stations and clearer reception.<br /><br />The speaker also has up to 8 hours of play time.  Obviously using the speakers lights or raising the volume will shorten play time, but if you are looking to extend play time, turning off the lights or lowering the volume will help.<br /><br />Nice, full sound.  The bass is deep, the mids are clear and you can hear the high(er) end of the music spectrum as cymbals ring out.  Nice sound.  You're not going to rock a stadium, but this speaker plays clearly even at louder volumes.<br /><br />At just $26 per speaker (you can get two of these, connect them to each other, then to your BT device, for a truer stereo sound), this speaker is a great deal.  It's rugged, it plays music or podcasts in a variety of ways, it's portable enough to go wherever you go and you can connect to FM radio for weather updates or emergency situation information.  And up to 8 hours of play time.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great value and will provide years of service.",[],B0BMGHWRWX,B0BZ132TRF,AFEELGA7N5BK7NVWR4VOHCRCGCVQ,2023-03-26 17:41:28.263,0,False,512
760770,4,Versatile device that works fairly well,"A very flexibly device that works surprisingly well.<br /><br />Biggest surprise is that you can only share audio if both people have 3.5mm devices - only the 3.5mm ports or the USB C audio port can be used at one time. So if one person has a 3.5mm headphone and the other has a USB C audio headphone, you can't share the audio.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Tested both 3.5mm ports with multiple headphones (Apple OEM, Sennheiser, Bose with Apple in-line controls, cheap no-name). All work perfectly with equal volume from both.<br />+ Tested the USB C audio port with both a native USB C headphone and regular headphones with a USB C to 3.5mm  adapter.  Worked with both.  In-line controls even worked for both the native USB C headphone and those used via Adapter.<br />+ Both 3.5mm audio ports can be used at the same time<br />+ Apple OEM devices in-line controls work - volume, start/stop<br />+ Can provide power to PD-enabled device and use audio ports (see limitation below)<br />+ Power port supports full PD power throughput (tested to 30w)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Does not charge non-PD devices, regardless of power type (PD, non-PD) provided<br />- Cannot use both the USB C audio with any of the 3.5mm audio ports at the same time<br />- Bose Apple in-line controls do not work, but the music does play<br />- With USB C audio port - you have to connect the adapter first, then USB C audio device to the adapter for the USB C audio to engage.  Otherwise seems they don't work.<br />- My copy seems to have a minor grounding problem - there is a faint background hum on the 3.5mm ports.  Detectable when used with noise-cancelling headphones.  Same headphones do not have the problem on other adapters.<br /><br />If you have an iPad, this is a good device.  The audio works well with my low-end Android 12 tablet, but it's a non-PD power device so I can't power it from this.<br /><br />If you device supports PD power, this is a very versatile device that works well.",[],B0BVFHSTHV,B0C4525ZZ5,AFVDEVDNHSXHQPIP5AK2YRLJ2OYA,2023-03-07 21:14:38.783,0,False,512
770502,4,"When it works, it works great - but the HEAT is disturbing","The signal is clear, stutter-free. Looks great on my HD TV. However, the audio is just so-so, nothing spectacular... but I guess it's mostly intended for presentations and such...<br /><br />My gripe with the transmitter is that it's absurdly shaped, needs external power (although I just plug it into the USB of my laptop) and heats up well above comfortable. It will burn if left on your leg (I'm watching a film transmitted to the TV while using my laptop for searching) PS: If your laptop has screen-mirroring you don't have to use the dongle/transmitter. You can log onto the receiver with WiFi, then click on the Control Panel icon and select mirroring - or extended display. Also, the receiver can log into your WiFi network so you still have online access and can stream your favorite shows on Amazon Prime...or whatever you use ;)<br /><br />The receiver, when connected to a screen/TV, puts a splash screen up that has instructions on how to pair the set (if they become unpaired - from the factory default) your devices, etc., and what the lights mean and how to troubleshoot. There's also an on-screen menu you can access by logging onto the receiver via WiFi and entering the IP of the device in a browser. It has lots of options!<br /><br />Portable devices can connect to the receiver directly via Wifi. Screen mirroring works well but a bit awkward looking in portrait mode on a widescreen TV (the default). I like the external display option with my laptop.<br /><br />This is NOT 4K! Advertising like it is, is dishonest. It (allegedly) can decode 4K but you're still viewing in 1080p 60Hz. As stated, the image is crisp and clean. I find it quite impressive.<br /><br />Lastly, the advertisements I've seen online state this device does not heat up like the others. I can't imagine other products heating up more than this one. It's really hot! How long it will last is anyone's guess. The receiver seems to remain comfortably warm.<br /><br />For the price it seems a good buy. I'm happy with the quality of the image and its convenience. But the shape of the transmitter/dongle sticking out of my laptop is ridiculous and the heat may be a deal-breaker for some.",[],B0B6BB4TP2,B0B6BB4TP2,AF3RGRSHGZADWRV6XKHVJQSSRWOA,2023-02-03 09:47:47.610,0,False,512

Just the case with the computer inside and a power cable.  The unit was not pristine.  There were scrapes and wear marks on the edges of the front panel.  Even the chrome HP logo was starting to fall off.  A little glue please??  Anyways, you get the main board, processor, mechanical 500GB hard drive (are you kidding in 2023??), one stick of 8gig ddr4-2100.  Well, I had the above input devices laying around so that was ok.  I had some memory sticks so I bumped it up to 16gb DDR4 dual channel.  You have no overclocking in the BIOS so limited to 2100 mhz on the mem.(HP business computer after all).  There is a NVME connector so out went the mech. HD and in with 1TB NVME.  There is a connector for a WiFi card on the MB but I had USB dongles for WiFI and Bluetooth laying around.  I added a low profile video card to the PCI-E 16 port.  Hard to remove the cover from the port to the outside but with a bit of work it was almost impossible to remove.  I ended bending the low quality pot metal case part but finally got the cover off the port and mounted the card.  I also had an Intel I7-6700 processor available, so I swapped that out for the I5 they include.<br />Bottom line...You don't get much but the price is cheap.  I would not have bought it if I did not have a lot of better spare parts lying around.  If you are looking for a computer for like Internet only or maybe some retro gaming this is fine.  This would not be a good choice for a novice computer user or gamer.  The list of what you don't get is much bigger than what you do.  Remember...you can't upgrade the OS because it won't run Windows 11 - no TPM 2.0.  Upgrader's dream but poor choice for the end user looking for a complete system.  This is not it.

920282,5,Exceptional Upgrade for the Price,"This projector upgrade is well worth the current price of $99. The attached photos were taken in a room light enough to read a book with, the picture is very sharp and bright, I am sure in a movie night setting where it would be darker the picture would only improve. These pictures were also taken at a full 100"" on the provided screen, not tightened or properly secured for an actual movie viewing. The first thing that came to mind at first sight was, it reminded me of when we first went from Standard Def to HD televisions when they came out (compared to previous model). Testing from 20 + feet away, also showed a relatively clear life-sized projection I intend to use for digital Halloween projections and is exactly what I was looking to add for this years decorating. Keep in mind this is not a $1,000 projector, I own 4 low-end models all under $100 and this, by far, takes the prize.<br />Addressing other reviews:<br />I scanned previous reviews for this projector and only found one poor review, which was probably user error in regards to connectivity with an Apple product. Another con was continuity on clarity within the corners of the screen. When setting up these projectors, do your best to project as straight as possible for best overall clarity  using as little keystone necessary and, again, keep in mind this is not a $1,000 projector. Lastly, people commented on a lack of mount threads for tripods or wall mounts, to mount this projector, remove the built in front height adjuster screw and you will be able to mount.<br />WiFi and Bluetooth additions to this projector work as they should, no need to add wired speakers, and also the ability to mirror your phone is an exemplary feature add for the price, usually you would pay another $50-$75 for these features and still not get the Lumens showcased here. The projector even feels more solid, which I noticed immediately, taking out of the box. The remote is basic, keystone basic, speaker basic, typical fan noise, play around with it for a night and these insignificant perceived flaws will not matter/disappear. Remember the price point and this projector is a no brainer.<br />I honestly have no complaints on this projector keeping the price point in mind. I would have seriously expected to pay $75-$100 more for one of this quality.

645175,5,"Wow!  High quality, works as intended, and actually weatherproof!","Kudos to WAVLINK for taking the weatherproofing claim seriously.  I previously tested an ""outdoor"" wifi extender that claimed to be weatherproof, and literally all they had done was put a plastic shield over the ethernet port.  This device is FAR better designed than that.  There is a single ethernet cable running to the device using power over ethernet, and the cable is tightly sealed by a thick foam rubber gasket and a plastic cover.  Each of the 4 antennas also has a rubber gasket around it to keep water out.  The POE injector is designed to live inside the house, garage, etc, and you use a long ethernet cable to get the wifi extender outdoors.  This is a very well thought out design.  In my case, I temporarily have the extender propped up inside the garage because it's the middle of winter - when spring comes around I will move it outside.<br /><br />To configure it as a wifi extender you plug it in, join to it's SSID, and then log in to the admin web page - there is no required mobile app.  The web page requires you to change the admin password and set the country and time zone.  Then it lets you configure the wifi.<br /><br />I like that when searching for local SSID's to mirror, it clearly calls out which are 5ghz and which are 2.4ghz.  I also like that when mirroring it creates two separate SSID's with the 5ghz and 2.4ghz in the name - so for the devices you are extending to, you can tell them which network to connect to.  There is a power meter (3 LED's) on the device itself so you can tell how much of a network signal it is collecting.  In my case it seems to do quite well - I have it in the garage about 80 feet away from my router and it is showing 3 LED's - full strength.<br /><br />Overall, I am shocked at how well thought out and easy to use this extender is.  I started working on configuring this about half an hour ago, and I had planned to tinker with it most of the morning.  Instead, here I am half an hour later writing up a positive review - it's all assembled, configured, and parked in the garage.<br /><br />Fantastic job WAVLINK!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715EjclXnrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715EjclXnrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715EjclXnrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MYA6ox0IL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MYA6ox0IL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MYA6ox0IL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bDsEhXA5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bDsEhXA5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bDsEhXA5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71x0XVTCDRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71x0XVTCDRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71x0XVTCDRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BM5VRSLY,B0BM5VRSLY,AHXJ7JLYLCBA2NKC6CEYPJ4AZEVQ,2023-01-21 16:00:18.882,0,False,512
214539,5,Just what I was looking for!,"I love this TV. I shopped a great deal for a new TV, and I really liked the FireTV. I read a ton of reviews, and researched a lot. I was concerned about other people's issues with the volume, as my husband has significant hearing loss. We have not had any issues with it though. He listens to the TV at about level 43 volume, and me at around a level 26, and each can hear it fine.<br />As the primary user of the TV, I really love the color, and the picture. I did take the advice of others that reviewed the TV and adjusted what version of sound mode I preferred.<br />This is our first Smart TV, and our first 4K TV, so the picture is a highly noticeable difference. Even on shows/movies/sports not done in 4K.<br />We don't use Alexa at all, so I have no opinion on that function. It is actually the main reason I didn't upgrade to the Omni series TV.<br />We have fiber optic internet, that I have chosen to hardwire to the TV. We are able to still use wi-fi to connect our (phone) remote app, and it works well. (When I have magically misplaced the remote.)<br />The direct app buttons on the remote are used more by my cat than myself. She stands on the remote, and inevitably she has selected Hulu. I simply forget they're there. Otherwise it's the same as my Fire Stick remote.<br />When signing into the TV, it offered to mirror my Fire Stick, and I allowed that. It made life a lot simpler!<br />Also, as another reviewer had recommended, I turned off the backlight, and all my blacks got blacker, and richer! That was great advice, thank you whom ever suggested that!<br />I do recommend that you occasionally (at least once a week) go into Device & Software, and Restart your TV. This helps my TV a lot. It has storage, and RAM. It needs cleared occasionally. (This is different than clearing your cache.)<br />On a final note, this is a great price! But, I got mine via the warehouse, where there was said to be slight cosmetic damage. Knowing that it could only be on the back of the TV and I would never see it, I ordered it! I have yet to find said damage, and saved some more money. Completely pleased with this purchase!",[],B08P3QB66R,B0971YMVC8,AEOT5ZYDSCL2GOVUZTUTZIRQWWEQ,2023-03-03 06:32:04.694,5,True,512
450884,5,like a solid block that stores data,"[[VIDEOID:4ceed20e94fe3e22dc132253e2edd4b9]] ~ ~ SHORT & SWEET NOTES<br /><br />My first impression with this was, ""this feels SOLID."" And it is. I popped the NVMe tray out to see how much might've been empty space and its sparing: only enough for the tray itself. The rest appears to be forged from a single billet - you can feel it in your hand! It's sturdy and won't be damaged lightly.<br /><br />I've used other external casings like this one, advertised as having aluminium shells for heat reduction - but none were even close to as thick as this is.<br />It doesn't have anything in the way of gimmicks (USB ports for your USB things, audio jacks, thermal readouts, etc), likely because it's just solid metal. If you want something that'll keep your data safe and soak up that extra heat this is it.<br /><br />The tray itself pops out without any trouble; there's a latch and you press on it and out it goes. It slides right back in just the same (you have to move the latch slider again). It comes with a short USB-c/USB-a cable. The whole set-up is nice looking, and even the logo emblazoned on the side doesn't have a tacky design.<br /><br />I'm happy with this and would totally recommend it as a travel drive - for when you need something bigger or more reliable than a flash drive but need to know it's okay with being thumped about a bit. And this will do that for me juuuuust right!<br /><br />----SIDE STUFF<br /><br /> - The cable it comes with is a 3.0 cable, which if I'm not mistaken won't hit the max advertised 6 Gigabits/second. I didn't knock a point off for this because to me, it's an easily remedied fix and the cable wasn't my focus - but it is still a minor negative.<br /> - A chip on the inside notes '25,000 MHz'. I'm guessing this is bus speed? but I'm not certain.<br /> - the listing says this but as a reminder, this won't work for M-key slotted drives. It must be either B-key or B+M key.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51dV7fl2ggL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51dV7fl2ggL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51dV7fl2ggL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51m2ngbTzbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51m2ngbTzbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51m2ngbTzbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611J09VjNwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611J09VjNwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611J09VjNwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Yf4M1gdAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Yf4M1gdAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Yf4M1gdAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B58XVK62,B0C5V1CT5T,AGSOEDVV3U5DDAYDKFKLZLQV5GGQ,2023-03-09 20:01:24.525,0,False,512
145368,5,This is a high quality product for a great price.  Why HDMI 2.1 matters.,"It's enough to say that this fully supports HDMI 2.1 because the standard speaks for itself. Your eyes can see a lot more detail than you realize. The newest tvs support large pixel densities on large screens which makes it easy to pick out single pixels that don't display correctly. At the highest densities each pixel can carry up to 10 or 11 bits of data to support HDR And your refreshing the screen 30 to 60 times per second. A 4k screen is really 3840 pixels across and 2180 pixels vertically.  Thats about 8.3 megapixels.  Or about 99.5 mb/s per refresh.  Or 6 Gb/s at 60 hz.  An 8k screen will be approaching 24 Gb/s.  If you are gaming, devices can try to push the refresh rate higher.<br /><br />It's easy to say so what, I am not running these resolutions or refresh rates. But you have to recognize that the only way that you can handle high signals is through special cables. The reason cable companies use that thick coaxial cable is because of a unique property that allows special constructions to act as lossless and low interference conductors. But for most flexible cables we have to use something called twisted pairs. Each of those pairs has to have a very special rate of twisting and separation and a ground plane shield to keep interference at a minimum. Every time you bend a cable especially if it's a sharp bend you cause a signal distortion. That can cause a few bits to arrive a bit later than others. That requires reconstructing the data or resending which slows things down and results in signal loss. Changing the twist rate or crushing the cable also reduces the signal strength. The longer the cable the more critical the design is.<br /><br />I have a gaming PC that is attached to a high speed monitor and I can run At resolutions greater than 4K and sync speeds approaching 120 hertz. And on a 32 inch monitor you can see if there is any jitter. The bottom line is that good quality cables matter. In this cable is clearly well made. Flexible, on the thick side because it has a very durable outer coating to keep crushing and bending losses to a minimum. The connectors are solid and well made. I know that this cable is going to continue to be useful to me for many years. And to be honest the price is amazing. A few years ago this would have cost 4-6 times more.",[],B09PRBPP3Y,B0C1ZYD3YQ,AGJMITFCEVMIP4HGSSFV5TEPJNVA,2023-03-30 15:19:53.795,1,False,512
554060,5,Works Great for Teleconferencing,"I got this headset to replace a headset I use for teleconferencing (using WebEx, or Teams). It comes with a control switch with a permanently attached 3-foot cable and a USB-C connector on the opposite end. It also comes with a USB-A to USB-C adapter, which makes it usable for different configurations right out of the box. The control switch provides functions for Volume, Play/Pause, Answer/Hangup and Mute/Unmute. The headset has a permanently attached 5-foot cable with an audio jack on the opposite end, which plugs into the control switch.<br /><br />The headset worked as soon as I plugged it into my laptop USB port. The control switch ""Phone"" button illuminates when the headset is powered. In my setup, the mute button and volume button functions, but pressing the ""Play"" and ""Phone"" buttons has no affect even when on a conference call. These may work with some other applications that I don't use. When not actively connected to a conference call, a female voice announces ""Mute"" through the headset speakers when the mute button is pressed. Likewise, ""Unmute"" is announced when the mute button is pressed again. When the headset is muted, the mute button illuminates red.<br /><br />I've been using the headset for a few weeks now and every call connection is very clear. Participants inform me that my voice comes across very clear as well. Compared to my old headset, this headset is much more comfortable, and I especially like that the mic boom can be rotated slightly over 180 degrees, making it usable regardless of how you wear it (e.g., you may prefer the cable on your right, rather than on your left). One minor issue for me is the length of the cable from the headset: at 5-feet long, it puts the switch control out of arms reach and you must ""reel it in"" to use it. My solution was to simply coil up the excess cable and secure it with a twist-tie. Not elegant, but effective. If I could change anything about the design, it would be to swap the cord lengths, so the switch control is much closer to the headset.<br /><br />My review is strictly based on using this headset for teleconferencing, so I cannot provide an opinion on its use for listening to music, or gaming. For my use, this is a good product: 5-stars.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KyPl3dnCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KyPl3dnCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KyPl3dnCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BQWNN341,B0BYD9132R,AFMMJN5LT23AEABAUW3Q4NLRWWGA,2023-02-21 04:49:24.106,1,False,512
649246,5,Effectively cools a Xeon E3-1245 (95w CPU) under stress test,"I'll admit, some of the negative reviews had me doubting this cooler, but I bought one anyways to give it a shot, and I have been very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I build quite a few systems, and so I go through lots of CPU coolers.  Some builds warrant the expensive coolers, but many do not.  I wanted to find a decent quality 'flower' type cooler that could effectively cool a CPU and look good in the process.  I've use many different models of these flower coolers, including the 'UFO' style as well as the very cheap ones with the thin aluminum fins and almost non-existent cowl, so I wanted to see where this one fell.<br /><br />I'm very happy to say that this one does a fantastic job, seems to have good quality construction, feels like it is made with a decent amount of metal to properly transfer the heat, and looks good in the process.<br /><br />In the case of my installation, I mounted it on a Xeon E3-1245 CPU (basically a Xeon equivalent of an i7-2600k), overclocked from 3.3 to 3.7 GHz.  I used a bog-standard gold color thermal paste and mounted it using the provided black plastic ring mount and clips.  This cooler mounts very easily on this ring, just as easily as mounting on a standard AM3 or AM4 cooler mount.  Motherboard is an ASUS P8Z77-LE Plus, for what it's worth.<br /><br />The fan is quiet, airflow is very good, and does a good job of cooling the components near the CPU in the process.<br /><br />With ambient air temps of around 72F (~22C), idle CPU temps hovered around 29-30C, and once I placed a sustained 100% load on the CPU, stabilized around a max of 68C.  Mind you, this is a 95W CPU, overclocked, and this cooler is a sub-$15 cooler.  I got it for $10.<br /><br />Yes, I know, a better cooler would have kept the CPU at least 10 degrees cooler, but you're definitely going to spend a lot more.  For only $10, I am very pleased at the overall capacity of this cooler.  On a 65W CPU (or lower), I have no doubt this cooler would be keeping things under 50C.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WL+hTuUCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WL+hTuUCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WL+hTuUCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ydahv4F-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ydahv4F-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ydahv4F-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0983NSDKS,B0983NSDKS,AE4VHED7PV3CSNPCQ4IIM3AB7Q7Q,2023-02-14 17:42:17.516,0,True,512
495725,5,Excellent 4K Video Quality,"The iZEEKER 4K Dash Cam dash cam is well presented and seems to be of high quality it was designed in the USA it comes with a 32 GB microSD card and it operates with USB cables the 12 volt car jack comes with a USB output Port which is a nice touch<br /><br />The setup process is easy: first it asks for the language selection, then it asks for date time, and finally it asks for the SD card to be inserted. I like that there are four buttons on the right and there are functions on the side of the screen indicating what the buttons do for example just like an ATM one button might line up to being an up button another for a down button it's very easy to use.<br /><br />The device does record audio and it does have a speaker for playing back audio but the sound is very soft (when played from the unit itself). There is an audio jack on the top of the unit. When audio is played back from videos on the computer, the audio is fine.<br /><br />The Dash Cam does not have the ability to take a photograph easily while it is recording, however there is an emergency mode that when pressed will record from the time the button is pressed up until it's pressed again, and it will automatically lock that video and store it in a separate easily accessible place for later access (“EMR” folder for Emergency).<br /><br />I like the suction cup for attaching to the windscreen. It attaches tightly, quickly and strongly.<br /><br />I don’t like that the USB power port for the device is at the top - I suppose the assumption is that the wire is run at the top of the windscreen (where a better view is to be achieved).<br /><br />The SD card doesn’t need to be ejected to review footage - the entire device can be plugged into a computer with a USB-C cable, and it attaches as a mass storage device. Videos recorded in Emergency mode are stored in the iZEEKER\EMR folder, and others in iZEEKER\EMR. The videos, without changing the resolution are of very high quality, and a 2min video runs about 330MB. Which gives ~2.5hrs of duration on the supplied 32GB SD card.<br /><br />The images recorded at night are really high quality too.<br /><br />I recommend this device.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HRuLfMAgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HRuLfMAgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HRuLfMAgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51KjHe90EmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51KjHe90EmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51KjHe90EmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L8mbq3t-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L8mbq3t-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L8mbq3t-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BLNNGNJ6,B0BLNNGNJ6,AG3FKFFQ3ETUVRF2ZSNUXRN2EXSA,2023-02-11 03:57:18.431,2,False,512
184124,4,"Great for the price, a bit slow","The Reindoo tablet is a surprisingly decent tablet for the low cost. Its build is not metal but it feels quite well made. The battery lasts a long time, over 5hrs of continuous use per charge. It runs on an Android OS, similar to a mobile interface. It runs a bit slower than higher end tablets and cellphones, but it still works quite well for basic applications such as watching videos and browsing the web. It also seems to only run on 2.4G Wifi networks. I had an issue with it crashing apps and unable to open them again without immediately going back to the home screen, but that problem seemed to disappear after updating and I haven't had that issue since.<br /><br />Overall, it is just like using an Android phone. Most things seem to default to low quality video that looks pixelated (480P). Since it seems to run more on a mobile interface, it auto selects video resolution based on ""Data rate"" and that always defaults to 480P even on a fast Wifi network. You have to manually change it to 1080P (max) on every video. The result is good though, with good color and resolution. I attached an image of it playing a ""4k"" video on Youtube, but in 1080P. It also has a ""comfort viewing"" setting other than screen brightness where you can adjust the blue light levels of the screen.<br /><br />The tablet also comes with a screen protector. The protector is easy to put on if you're familiar with using a card to squeeze out the air bubbles. Be aware that there is a groove for the screen side camera so it must go on in a specific orientation. The protector is also EXACTLY the size of the tablet screen so you must perfectly align the protector to one side within 0.5mm or less, or it will stick out the other end and leave a raised air bubble edge. I accidentally skewed it so one side had a 1 mm gap on one end, so the other side stuck 1mm over the edge, leaving a small air bubble gap at the edge. It doesn't affect the use though. The screen protector is somewhat antireflective has a textured feel like a Kindle reader which I quite like.<br /><br />Overall, this is a surprisingly great tablet under $100. It is suitable for light work and general browsing. I think this is a great tablet for children instead of more expensive tablets like Ipads and Surfaces.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Itz1nfYrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Itz1nfYrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Itz1nfYrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CjerTWeYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CjerTWeYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CjerTWeYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BKLF533J,B0C3DCRL4G,AHG2BQ4C7TC4VZDKTWDTRRPFQBBQ,2023-01-20 10:43:45.517,2,False,512

For the ones I've tested, none of them were bad.  In fact, all of them are better than my airpod pros.  Many times better.  Unless you have to have a wireless earbuds, there is no reason not to buy one of these budget IEMs to listen to music.<br /><br />Dunu Titan S is one of the more popular budget IEMs in the market, and one of the IEMsI  tested.<br /><br />There are tons of YouTube reviews about this IEM.  You can learn about more the Pros and Cons from these videos.<br /><br />One thing that stands out to me is the accessories came with this IEM.  Th pouch is high quality, and the color is beautiful.  It feels like and “smell” like a $100 fashion branded wallet.  I actually prefer it over the cases came with other more expensive IEMs.<br /><br />It also comes with a number of high-quality silicone ear tips.  You must try them all to determine which set best fits you.  Ear tips make or break your experience.  If the bass is lacking, it is probably due to poor fit of your ear tips.<br /><br />As for the sound quality, I really like this IEM.  It sounds natural with a slight bump in mid bass.  I prefer warm and dark sound.  I like how tight the bass is.  It is not super punchy but sounds just right.  The bass is very clean.  It gives you the sense of weight but not overwhelming.  Sometimes I do wish it had a bit more bass when listening to Jazz.<br /><br />The mids are thick and comfortable.  I prefer Jazz and female vocals.  This IEM sounds so relaxing that I can listen to it for hours.  As for the highs, it is slightly on the bright side, but not shouty.  The detail is very good.  Soundstage is good for IEM, and imaging is great.  Instrument separation is surprisingly capable.  I have no problem pinpointing the position of different instruments.<br /><br />Overall, I really like Dunu Titan S.  For the price, it is as good as it gets.

13311,5,A very nice keyboard with many connection options.,"Typically I stick to higher end gaming keyboards.  Mechanical and optical switches are generally my go to.  I had never used a keyboard from this brand before so when I was given the chance to grab one, I figured I would see how it stacks up.<br /><br />So far I'm fairly impressed.  I've used some tournament edition keyboards with the smaller form factor from other brands so I knew what I was getting into when it came to the size of the keyboard.  All in all, sizing is fine.  They key placement and distance between keys works fine.  I do run into issues at times where my fingers get lost on the right side of the keyboard.  Getting used to that will come in time though.  The key response is quick.  They are mechanical switches but they do manage to deaden the sound a bit which is nice.  The RGB features are basic at best.  You have a few settings you can select from and all of it is done directly on the keyboard itself.  It has your normal basic modes.  It illuminates well though and you can increase/decrease the brightness.  The build quality is nice.  For being a 75% keyboard, it has some weight to it.  I like the fact the keys are labeled for both Mac and PC.  I primarily use it on my PC though.  The place where it seems to shine is in the connectivity department.  I can connect it by bluetooth to numerous devices or I can have it wired.  I generally run wired to my main PC and if I need to use it on my MacBook or other devices, I just unplug it from the PC and connect by BT to the other device.  It works out nicely.<br /><br />From a gaming standpoint (which I do a lot of), I'm not certain that I like it as much yet.  Emphasis on the ""yet"".  I know it takes some time to become accustomed to a new keyboard.  The response and feel.  I'm going to continue gaming on it for a while to see if I become more adapted to it.  It just feels different than what I'm used to.  It most likely has to do with the key spacing more so than anything else.<br /><br />This is definitely a nice keyboard and I recommend it.

445395,1,Would only work with optical and the sound isn't as good as my TV,"I have an Omni Fire TV which I purchased about 6 months ago. I was excited about this sound bar - especially when I unboxed it. It looks fantastic and I thought for sure it'd be a very nice upgrade to the sound. I tried bluetooth first and it connected without a problem, but there was no sound. I tried everything I could think of but no-go. I've hooked up many speaker systems so I can almost always figure out what the problem is and it's never a big deal to me.<br /><br />I next tried hdmi - same thing no sound. Next, I tried the optical (which I've never used before) and it worked immediately with no problem. Well, no problem getting sound at least. A few problems came up: My Fire remote wouldn't change the sound so I would have to use the soundbar remote for sound. That's pretty much a no-go for me because that was a typical issue with technology 20 years ago - today, it's highly unusual that I can't get the soundbar to obey the Fire TV commands.<br /><br />Also, the sound quality wasn't nearly as good as the native speakers on the TV. There was very little bass and the upper ranges sounded... well, what's the word? Tinny and flat? It was definitely not an improvement in sound but a significant downgrade.<br /><br />This leaves the final problem which out of them all, for me, is a complete deal breaker. The soundbar volume ranges from 1-30. On 2 it was too loud for me, on 1 it was too soft. The difference between those two was huge - no gradation in sound between the numbers.<br /><br />With all of the issues, I spent a long time trying to remedy them. I definitely didn't give up after 5 mins. Pretty much a whole day was spent trying to make the soundbar produce good, quality sound. I've read the reviews from others and I don't know if I got a dud or what - so many people love theirs. Overall I'm very disappointed.

322794,4,"Good budget ANC over-the-ear headphones, but no case and tight headband","I used these recently on a road trip which had two 10hr+ days in the car during my ""rest period"" as a passenger.  I paired these headphones with my iPhone and iPad Pro, listening to music and also watching content from Netflix.  Although neither device has a headphone jack, I appreciate that the manufacturer includes the capability to use a cord, since that would come in particularly handy using in-seat entertainment on an airplane.  I own a set of wired Bose QuietComfort headphones that are over 10 years old and also more modern 1st gen Air Pods Pro, so that's what I will be comparing the noise cancellation against.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality.  I wouldn't say it is better than the Air Pods Pro, but was very good for the price point.  Many inexpensive headphones emphasize too much bass or not enough, these seem to be very well balanced.  The noise cancellation was also effective at getting rid of the road noise.  It is old school noise cancellation focused primarily on the lower range frequencies like road noise, airplane hum, etc. not next-level sophistication like the QC700s, Air Pods Pro 2, or Air Pods Max.  But entirely appropriate for the price point, since those models cost several times more than these.<br /><br />Two things hold me back from giving these headphones five stars.  1) there is no case.  I ended up storing them in the cardboard box that they shipped in, but that is not gonna hold up long term.  I hoped that they might fit inside my old QuietComfort case but alas that did not work.  Looking at the construction materials and also knowing how my QuietComfort held up with a case, I don't think these will last long just thrown loosely into a bag.  2) the tension on the headband is quite tight.  I found myself taking these off after 3-4 hours because they were hurting my ears.  Perhaps the tension will loosen over time/usage, but I can't imagine wearing these for a whole 8 hour work day.<br /><br />Another minor problem that I encountered - which possibly may be an issue only with Apple devices:  there was a slight lip-sync delay when I was watching a show on Netflix.  This delay did not occur when I switched to the Air Pods Pro, so possibly there is an issue with the Bluetooth handshaking between these headphones and Apple products.",[],B0BYSKJ5FQ,B0BYSKJ5FQ,AHYOBO3EYSNTJLI3VTQGHSN5L5PQ,2023-04-09 23:49:01.299,1,False,512
396231,5,Good tertiary monitor for multi-monitor setups and TM MFDs,"I use mine for a flight sim setup where i put little maps, FPL, Navigraph, MSFS and XP12 detached windows, and Helios button displays for DCS.  I also have a detachable TM MFD setup (2) that fits great over the widescreen, allowing me to port both MFD's to the same screen under each MFD bezel.  They both just fit with room on either side and in the middle to adjust to the MFD bezel position.  Edge is thick enough to hold MFDs with tape if that is what you prefer.  The monitor is plug and play, with a quick adjustment in Windows 10 display settings to get it perfect.  Oh I left the plastic protective cover on the screen to keep the TM MFDs from damaging the screen.<br />Display is not great, but tbf, that wasn't my goal.  Its a small monitor and you are NOT gonna be watching 1080p movies on it IMHO.  I mean you can, but its not that great.  Color is a bit diffused, but brightness is excellent.  Contrast ratio is not great and there is a distinctive ""bright spot"" in the lower left hand corner (which I've covered conveniently with a TM MFD bezel plate!)  My maps and cockpit repeaters / HUD look fine on it.  It is 1920x1080 so the text / icons are very small.  But I like that.  Menu is a bit fumbled for the monitor settings, with the buttons on the back right side.<br />HDMI cable provided is not good, but there is a handy extension provided to offset the HDMI plug from the back (convenient as I don't always use it (like swapping in a VR headset instead) and can easily unplug the HDMI without screwing up my setup.  The stand is meh.  It holds the monitor ok, but you can't use it to hold it when the MFDs are on it, and try to press.  It folds back and moves around with any decent pressing pressure.  Therefore I mounted it against my main monitor stand to press up against.  Works 4.0.<br />I was surprised to hear it had speakers (which my Win 10 defaulted to when I plugged it in.  Not terrible but fairly loud for the size of the monitor.  Good backup speaker I guess.<br />All in all, happy with it.  It gets daily use.",[],B088FRYSFZ,B088FRYSFZ,AES4GHIZFAENGBI44HVX62QLDM4A,2023-02-20 15:51:33.050,0,True,512
674,5,The best streamer on the market today,"This device has dethroned the Nvidia shield 2019 as the premier streaming device.<br /><br />Amazon finally hit it right with this device.  If you can get past the user interface, and that is very subjective because I happen to like the interface,this third generation cube does everything the other devices do, and then some.<br /><br />It beats the Apple TV 4K because the Alexa integration into the cube gives it the edge.  The Apple TV 4K does a better job at frame rate switching, but that is becoming less important since TVs today do a pretty good job of extracting 24p content from 60p signal from the streamer.  Virtually all content that is provided by the streaming services is 23.976 frames per second or 24.0 frames per second (i.e. 24p).<br /><br />The last time I checked, the cube will not output content at 24.0 frames per second or 30.0 frames per second or 60.0 frames per second.  Admittedly, there is not much material that is created using those exact frame rates.  But if you do come across some content like Amazon's own rings of power that is created at exactly 24.0 frames per second, then you might see an occasional frame jump every 42 seconds.  Not everyone is susceptible to that frame jump.<br /><br />It beats the Nvidia shield 2019 because it bit streams lossless audio from local rips.  The super resolution feature of the cube is not as good as the shields AI upscaling, but it is better than the upscaling the other streamers provide.<br /><br />I have the harmony hub remote control setup.  I added the skill for Alexa to control my setup so now I can turn on and off my system with just using my voice.<br /><br />The lan interface is something that I do not use. So while it is maxed out at 100 megabit, which could mean about 80 to 90 Mbits of real world performance, that is not fast enough when streaming 4K rips from a Plex server or using Kodi.  I have Wi-Fi 6 and my internal lan speed is well over 500 megabits per second to the cube.  The ethernet port is really only needed if you have horrible Wi-Fi service. This cube has a nice Wi-Fi radio in it with some pretty good range.<br /><br />I highly recommend the cube.",[],B09BZZ3MM7,B0BFD4M9C8,AHUWX53ZC4Z32ART6ZD5HJNJGPFA,2023-02-17 17:13:03.576,18,True,512
99688,5,Works great with decent sound & nice cheap solution!,"I wasn't looking for anything specific for wirelessly streaming music out of my phone or laptop into my vintage Kenwood and Vector Research AM/FM receivers from the late 70's. So I figured I would initially try this Esinkin Bluetooth adapter device out, as is was under $25. I just wanted to try out the technology, even though there are much higher spec and higher cost receiver adapters out there to choose from. I found out it is really the exact same device as the Logitech version, which costs just a little more. Anyway, the simple illustration type instructions could be better if written out, but easy to decipher. I like that it came with power plug adapter, and a simple 1/8"" into RCA plugs cord to get you going immediately. You can also run a dedicated short RCA cord from the Esinkin device into your Aux or Tape Monitor input jacks, but you must supply that RCA cord, which many people have lying around. Note: Do NOT plug it into the Phono input jacks. Instructions indicate you CAN actually power it off by holding down the top pairing button for at least 3 seconds. But it paired very quickly with my android phone, no problem. I have the Esinkin always in ""auto on"" mode by simply having its power adapter plugged into the ""switched"" power outlet on back of both my vintage receivers, so it will only power on and attempt to connect to my Bluetooth music devices when actually I power up the receivers themselves. Perfect. From day one since using it works flawlessly and provides nice acceptable sound when streaming Pandora, Spotify, or YouTube audio. Good lows and highs. You can look up the specs, but again will not be up to the same sound quality you may get out of the ones costing hundreds more. I get a more compressed sound quality of say MP3 files, and it will not be a full CD or FLAC/lossless audio quality. But it works great for my needs and not feeling a need to upgrade to anything else at the moment. More than satisfactory for streaming background music too. Also, the signal range was fine to any room in the house I was in with my phone, but I have a smaller home. I'm just glad I found a cool new unobtrusive device that gives me another music source option to run into my vintage home receivers, and enjoy when not listening to AM/FM, phono, or CD player. No complaints so far.<br />-Ken V.",[],B016NUTG5K,B016NUTG5K,AFCBGXTHON7AOFS53HBJYJR6S4ZA,2023-01-02 22:46:22.398,15,True,511
675932,5,Good headphones for a budget price,"I was looking for another pair of headphones/earbuds that I could keep at work. I had purchased a pair of Capoxo D8 headphones a few months ago and really liked them. Keep those at home. Great sound and features for the price. Anyways, since I was already familiar with Capaxo brand, I saw these smaller headphones with similar features.<br /><br />Key highlights that I like about these headphones/earbuds:<br />-Extremely comfortable to wear. They don't feel heavy and fit very well. Barely feel them in your ear. I feel they fit better than the higher end headphones I have. Can shake my head and they don't budge unlike some of my past headphones/earbuds that come loose after 20-30mins or you have to adjust them so they fit better in your ear.<br />-The headphones/earbuds are very compact and light. I like the compact size. As previously mentioned you can barely feel them.<br />- I like the color of them. Very stylish. Nicer than the white color on the competitor headphones.<br />-One of the best features is they have wireless charging! This is so convenient compared to my old headphones that you plugged into a USB port. Theres a USB C port but I'd rather do wireless charging.<br />The case is compact and not bulky. That was one complaint I had with my Capoxo D8 headphones. The case was rather large but this case is very small where its barely noticeable in your pocket.<br />-Offer an excellent amount of battery life. They charge quickly and lasted me about 4 days running for 8hrs) before having to recharge them. My old headphones/earbuds would only last for about 4-5hours and then I would have to recharge them. I also like that they have a display with the battery life.<br />-The hinge feels solid and not flimsy. Constructed very well. You can tell its a quality product.<br />-They have good sound quality. Good amount of treble and bass. Not a lot of bass that it drowns out the music and treble that they are screeching when singing.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with these headphones/earbuds and would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of headphones/earbuds that won't break the bank. You'll be happy with these headphones/earbuds.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ekUZPB87L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ekUZPB87L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ekUZPB87L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FUQFz+N2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FUQFz+N2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FUQFz+N2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RJ-uqUO6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RJ-uqUO6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RJ-uqUO6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZzthP4bbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZzthP4bbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZzthP4bbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Rjwpkcs3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Rjwpkcs3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Rjwpkcs3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nrpSpVjpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nrpSpVjpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nrpSpVjpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BNG3N62H,B0BNG1JP5Z,AF2UGXYPOLZIYNREY53QGTNGPUMA,2023-01-27 17:15:22.375,0,True,511
950729,4,Excellent Sound Quality!,"OVERALL: great value, compact design, great battery, single-device connection, easy controls<br /><br />PROS: These earbuds have the best sound quality and BASS of all the wireless Bluetooth devices I own. The Battery arrives charged and ready to go and is unbelievably long-lasting, with extra charges in the charging case. I really like the controls and system of indicators, which are clearly explained in both the full manual as well as a smaller quick guide that I kept on my desk for the first few days. There are no buttons, all controls are just different taps on either L/R. That being said, the controls are very sensitive and I often accidentally change the volume when messing with my hair or glasses. But it's just as easily changed back. Pairing with a device is as easy as taking the earbuds out of the case and selecting the N09-A device in the Bluetooth settings on your phone/computer/TV. After charging, the earbuds connect automatically to the last device they were connected to, assuming that the device has Bluetooth turned on.<br />I had low expectations for the phone function after experiences with older devices, but the phone functions on these earbuds are EXCELLENT. They work very similarly to modern Bluetooth hearing aids, whereby you accept, decline, and end calls with a tap or hold of either earpiece. Volume and music control works on a left/right system whereby the right earpiece increases volume or skips to the next music track, and the left decreases volume or skips back a track. Pretty easy stuff to learn with a little practice. You don't have to worry about wasting battery if you forget to turn them off: there is no ""OFF"" function, and they turn themselves off after 5 minutes of no Bluetooth connection (or when you put them into the case).<br /><br />CON: You can ""pair"" these earbuds with multiple Bluetooth devices of pretty much any type (transmitter, phone, computer, TV) BUT they will only ""connect"" with one device at a time. So, for example, I can't use them with my phone and computer at the same time. To switch from my laptop to my phone, for example, I have to turn Bluetooth off on the laptop, and then select the N09-A device on my phone. I have cheaper earbuds that can handle two devices and/or more seamlessly transition from one to the other.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81MKfZPhVtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81MKfZPhVtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81MKfZPhVtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BGC44HJ2,B0C58R5D7Q,AEMEE6JWNG65XFR5VOJG2NC5N63Q,2023-03-19 14:41:46.633,1,False,511

195852,1,Played this thing in the sun and the battery died.,"When I saw this item I was excited.  I like being prepared for emergencies.  This has a solar panel, is supposedly waterproof, has a speaker, flashlight, radio, and for some reason party lights.  So in terms of use lets look at the speaker and bluetooth function.  This device connected easily and the speaker is loud.  The sound quality is good not great, not being full sounding, and slightly garbled on some songs when played at full volume.  The flashlight works and has a strobe function.  The radio works. The party lights work.  It has several inputs on the back and an on off switch none of which looked weather rated and decided not to tempt fate and ruin this thing.  There is no display so you cannot see what radio station you are listening to, volume, mode, nor your battery percentage, etc.  The sound when on the radio function was sub par, but I think of this as more of an emergency feature in this day and age, so I did not judge that too harshly.  The buttons are very confusing overall, and with no printed instructions on the unit you could get very confused trying to operate this without the box that seemed to be the only instruction list included.  I listened to it outside on BT and got about 3 hours with 80% battery (it did show battery % under my bluetooth on the phone) on full volume.  All of this would have gotten it 3 stars from me normally.  So why 1 star?  I used it outside on a sunny day and it died after 3 hours as I said.  If there is some special way to get it to charge using the solar panel I don't know.  There is no special instructions from what I saw, so I should have been able to use this in the sun and it should have charged it, or at least maintained the original battery level instead of letting it drain out.  In an emergency this would be useless since you couldn't maintain the battery with no power supply.  And I couldn't turn off the party lights, and there were no instructions, if there is a way to do so.  In any case I don't know how many flashlight radio emergency situations that call for different colored flashing lights you can't get rid of.  So 1 star, add a display, give me confidence this is weather proof, kill the party lights, and most importantly get your solar panel to work, and I'd be glad to give it 5 stars.",[],B0BHR4XFVS,B0BHR4XFVS,AFPYKLPZYCGKSQF5PMHNCZ6PX5CA,2023-01-02 21:20:49.148,0,False,511
356518,4,Light works better than ring and here's why...,"If you are tired of ring reflections on your glasses or an odd halo effect, this light is perfect for you.<br /><br />I'll start by saying the pictures for this device and the illumination shown are 100% accurate - so much that there is no need for me to include pictures of my face (thank goodness). included are pictures of the set up and the ""instruction manual"" that come with the light.<br /><br />The seller notes the run time is 120 min. I found on the bright setting the light will go out after 90 - 120  min ... even though it is plugged in via the USB C compatible charging cable (included).  The cable is 1 meter long (about 39 in.).  It did not come charged right out of the box, so I had to charge it for two hours first.  This is important, as it looks like it doesn't work at first glance - it really needs to be fully charged before using or the light will go off prematurely.  Just because it is plugged into a power source, it doesn't work right away as it takes time for the Li-On 1500 m Ah to charge.<br /><br />The good thing is that it the light rotates side to side and it clamps perfectly on top of a lap top and doesn't obscure the camera.  It also doesn't give me the ring reflection on my glasses that those round lights do. This light is definitely better than the overrated ring lights.<br /><br />The issue is I am on Zoom for hours at a time and even 2 hours is too short if I was to use the lowest light setting.  This product is good for short calls or videos and/or a camera if you cannot plug the light into a power source.  I will need to use another light to supplement this one (or take a job with less Zoom meetings!!) as it does go out after two hours to recharge.  This will work well while on travel and for short meetings.  The clamp on this light is superb.<br /><br />The instructions are funny.  ""Manul of fill light"" is definitely a bad translation and the instructions to ""connect the power outlet charging"" are 4 steps of rubbish.  Still... most could figure out how to attach the included cord from the light to your power block (not included).<br /><br />This product arrived really fast and the minimal packaging is appreciated.

594004,5,Very happy with this case and keyboard,"I purchased this for my Surface Go 3 because I wanted the keyboard, I didn't care about the case.  But after receiving it, the case is very nice.<br /><br />As you can see from my pictures, the case has cut outs so you can easily turn on the tablet and adjust the volume.  Also, on the side there is a nice cut out so the different openings can be accessed, such as the charging port.  The case doesn't block anything that you need access to.  The only thing I would like to have seen be different with the case, is some type of protection around the bottom of the tablet.  This does have protection that goes around the base of the kickstand, but that will only protect the bottom of the tablet if the kickstand is in the closed position.  Once open, there is no protection to the bottom of the tablet.<br /><br />The keyboard did need to be charged before I could use it.  Once charged setting it up to blue tooth was very easy.  The included instructions are very easy to understand.  It walked me through it step by step.<br /><br />On the bottom right side of the keyboard is the on/off switch and the charging port for the keyboard.  It uses a USB C cable.<br /><br />I really like that the keyboard is wireless.  I don't have to have it attached to my tablet for it to work.  I just have to be within 33 feet.  That makes it nice when I don't have a lot of room to sit at comfortably, I can have the keyboard separate from the tablet and everything still works.  When you do want the keyboard to be attached, it is done magnetically.  Just get the keyboard close to the edge of the tablet and it snaps right in place.<br /><br />When you are done, just close the tablet using the keyboard as the cover and now you have the screen protected.  The keyboard does not snap in place once you put it over the tablet itself, but it does keep the screen covered.  It would have been nice to have some sort of snap mechanism that the keyboard went into to keep it secured to the front of the screen.<br /><br />I think this is a fantastic keyboard and case.  I had been pricing keyboards and going with this one saved me a lot of money and I got a case in the bargain.  This is well worth the price.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YQ8nWo1lL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YQ8nWo1lL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YQ8nWo1lL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oA+5TxcxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oA+5TxcxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oA+5TxcxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oduzZYk4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oduzZYk4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oduzZYk4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qrr+PiBYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qrr+PiBYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qrr+PiBYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xqKayVH9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xqKayVH9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xqKayVH9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715nXLpckrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715nXLpckrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715nXLpckrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BJ8W25TL,B0BYJ6THY9,AEJ4BITCXXWZ6QUS6ORMHAKUS3XQ,2023-01-12 16:36:34.045,0,False,511
235293,4,A “Must Have” for your vehicle.,"Usually, I don’t write long reviews. But this product deserves a thorough review. You need this if your car came with “wired” Apple CarPlay. So many times I forgot to unplug and then take my phone with me when leaving the car. This adapter solves the problem, it’s “wireless Bluetooth” connectivity.<br />First, I checked out the reviews of all the available (and there’s dozens of them) units on Amazon.<br />This one seemed like the most promising one, at a reasonable cost (under $100).<br />Second, when you get it, you need to pair it with your vehicle. (I have a Lexus LS500). The pairing was somewhat difficult at first, so I figured out that I had to unpair my iPhone from the vehicle, then it would pair with the CarPlay adapter. Done!<br />Third, you should shut down your vehicle and restart. You will get a prompt on your screen that says: only one “Bluetooth” connection is required, so you click okay to connect the CarPlay as your choice.<br />Fourth, now the adapter is acting as the Bluetooth connection for your phone to the vehicle, which makes the “wireless Bluetooth” Apple CarPlay work.<br />Fifth, it works almost seamlessly most of the time.<br />Here’s where you might find it annoying.<br />Sometimes you will get the prompt to say “okay to connect with the Bluetooth adapter”, and sometimes it just connects automatically.<br />And, once in a while you will get a blank or blank screen with the words “CarPlay” and it might take a few seconds for it to connect. Other times you will have to unplug it from the USB and then plug it in again to restart it. It’s seamless about 90% of the time.<br />Sixth, because it will connect again with just a little minor effort (unplug and replug takes a couple seconds), I’m satisfied with the quality of the connection. After reading the reviews of other units (and again, there’s dozens of them) the few hiccups that I have experienced seems to be prevalent with most of them. So I’m keeping this.<br />The look and the use of the actual Apple CarPlay is identical, wired or wireless.

497796,4,"Works well, but no documentation","The card is working well for what I need, which is eSATA ports.  (5 stars)  However, it did require me to figure out a few things on my own because no documentation came with it.  (-1 star)<br /><br />Package Contents<br /><br />The packaging was soft (not rigid), but it appears that the card was unharmed in transit.  I received the card (wrapped in an anti-static inside the package) as well as a mini CD (80mm diameter) that was not in any kind of protective cover or sleeve.  The CD contains several different drivers without a clear indication of which was the correct one for this card.<br /><br />Installing the Driver<br /><br />Without the Driver on my new Windows 11 PC, the device did not appear to be recognized by my computer.  I had not figured out which device to look for in Device Manager until after I had the driver installed, so it's possible that the extra driver is not required.  On the driver CD, I figured out that the driver is the one inside the ""ASM1061 Sata6GB"" folder.  I had to go into the only subfolder (asmedia_106x_3.0.2) and run the ""setup.exe"" program.  The installation was straightforward.  Once the driver was installed, I found the ""Asmedia 106x SATA Controller"" device inside the ""Storage controllers"" section of Device Manager.<br /><br />Configuring for eSATA<br /><br />There are two sets of jumpers on the card.  In the default position (all covering the top two pegs), the SATA ports on the top of the card are active and the eSATA ports on the side of the card are inactive.  Moving the jumpers to the lower position (all covering the bottom two pegs) turns off the SATA ports and turns on the eSATA ports.  It appears possible to have one SATA and one eSATA port active, but I switched both to eSATA for my use, so have not tested this.  The jumpers on the left appear to select either the left SATA or the top eSATA port.  The jumpers on the right appear to select either the right SATA or the bottom eSATA port.<br /><br />Hopefully this helps anyone else who might purchase this card.",[],B0BD8NV7K6,B0BD8NV7K6,AFM2ETNH2HSD6FGH6BY2ZBXIJXDQ,2023-02-26 20:55:19.354,0,True,511
310155,5,Get this Pre Amp.,"This pre amp has changed my whole outlook on things ... I have been using many preamps, over the years, NAD, Denon; Onkyo; Little Bear T-8 Pro-Ject MM and the original Mani to name a few. None have been outrageously priced, or too extravagant, I just want good sound at a reasonable price. The original Mani was actually giving me the most satisfaction of the ones I had tried. And was the most recent in my system.... Lately I was thinking of getting a new moving coil cartridge because my current cartridge the Ortofon 2M Bronze being good and having it for years now, still leaves room for improvement...So I thought maybe the New Mani would be a better fit for a new moving coil cartridge like the Hana SL or Sumiko Songbird etc... As the original Mani while good with Moving Magnets falls short with low output Moving coils, or so it's said according to reviews....So anyway, still using the Ortofon 2M Bronze after purchase, I hooked this Mani 2 up to my system and... bam...The Ortofon 2M Bronze opened up like I had never heard it before. Remember how the 2M Bronze is supposed to be analytical and dry? Not any more this thing turned the 2M Bronze into a musical flying instrument. Greater detail that surpasses the good detail I was so fond of before. In addition, more bass, more bounce, cleaner highs and a more focused soundstage where you can focus and pick out individual instruments better, everything sounds more real, like you're listing to a violin instead of a recording of a violin, vocals also sound more real ....Advanced high points adjustable capacitance, subsonic filter. Getting the capacitance right for your Moving Magnet Cartridge is critical to get the most out of it...Some need 100 Pf some need 300 Pf to sound their best. I've set 147 Pf (on the Mani) for the 2m Bronze with Mogami 2964 cables (19pf a foot) so I'm getting about 240 pf total... Subsonic filter...Do you like to play it loud or do you use a subwoofer? If that is the case, you need this feature. I use it and I think it makes things sound better...Moving Coil adjustments? They are needed. Why pay the price if you're not going to get the sonic benefits from your Moving Coil? Either way get this pre amp...","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Z5mlXJgPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Z5mlXJgPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Z5mlXJgPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SIGSK0aAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SIGSK0aAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SIGSK0aAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09S64DS85,B09S64DS85,AGUUOYSSTNOQB7BPKJVZTFC2YQSQ,2023-01-24 05:20:21.115,5,False,511
889526,5,Best multi device charger yet,"Power bricks shouldn’t brick the way they do. Neither should cables, which omg Amazon sellers have made millions from selling subpar products where we are a lone step on the way to the landfill. Now that USB C is becoming more standardized, hopefully we are moving away from the pandemic and pre pandemic days of lightning cables arriving with the male connection end detached and as far as I have seen there are no more guaranteed cable replacements, which sounded great, but should have been presented as “buy one get one free for twice the shortest life ever” or  “we are sending you a second cable for when this one fails”. But I never noticed power bricks bricking until the transition away from lightning cables had begun. You try to find a company label that is consistent, but how do you know who is manufacturing what and why do some of these companies suddenly disappear as others reappear with vaguely similar names?<br />So far this brick has not bricked despite me giving a at least one really good reason to do so. It’s a solid accessory in terms of build. I’ve had the dual plugin prongs on Anker bricks decide to decouple and do their own things, seemingly tired of always working with a binary partner, which isn’t going to happen with this interface. I like how it plugs into an outlet like any other traditional device, with a three prong plug at the end of a cord. I am also benefiting from being able to plug my little Fender Mustang GT amp into it which greatly improved a cable management issue I was having.<br />So far the only weird thing has been the difference on power output that is supposedly indicated by your blue ring and an occasional issue I’m having with my iPad Pro dipping on and off from the charge - it gets annoying hearing the digital bell indicator for when you are connected to charge over and over again. But that might well be my iPad since a hard restart has pulled it from cycling off and on like that and back into a regular connect and charge.<br />5 stars is not common, but until I find something that I can clearly prove is the fault of this brick or until it becomes an actual plastic brick I will give it all 5 stars. At that point, depending on what/why it fails I will determine if customer service is good enough to retain all 5 stars.<br />So far so good and a nice change in the paradigm of straight to plug in bricks.",[],B0BF4GTGZD,B0CFJLFP5J,AH4MHQBXUVUCQP3RSUGBGB6DBO3Q,2023-01-25 12:34:03.013,3,True,511
438949,3,Where's the management software?,"Not recommended unless you absolutely can't afford a more expensive brand.<br /><br />The price is good. The item itself is working well so far. I've had reasonably good experience with a different model. But the annoying thing is trying to obtain the control/management software.<br /><br />The user manual says to look in one place, which doesn't exist. The product description says to look another place, which doesn't have a download link.<br /><br />One version of the management software is available if you open the ""User Guide"" PDF and then click the ""download"" button located in that document. Seriously. The download ""button"" is embedded in a PDF document. The program is PowerMaster Plus (PM+) 1.05, a very powerful management system that can track multiple devices and do all kinds of stuff with them. Unfortunately there isn't any documentation included, and it's a bit confusing to install (local or remote?). And when you run the program it appears to do nothing. In actuality, however, it opens a browser window where you log in and run the program via a network connection to your local machine. I'm not joking. PowerMaster+ seems to be designed for network professionals, not normal home users.<br /><br />The other version of the management software is PowerPanel Personal Edition (PPP) 1.4.3. Fortunately for me, I'd downloaded and installed it for previous UPS. It worked fine when I switched to the USB cable to the new device. But if that hadn't been the case, I wouldn't have known PPP even existed, much less been able to download it. Some of the reviews and answers have direct links to the download, which still exists, but this isn't an option as far as the product listing is concerned. The listing doesn't mention it nor does it provide any way to download it. Unlike PM+, PPP is a simpler and more user-friendly management program. I recommend using it.<br /><br />I don't know what's happened in the four years since I purchased my other UPS and downloaded PPP (with no problem), but I find the situation to be a bit ridiculous, especially given all the questions and reviews asking how to find the management software.<br /><br />For that reason I don't recommend this product if you can afford a different brand with a better customer experience. I give it 3/5 stars for the management software confusion. Not recommended.",[],B07RRYB3RJ,B079Z981R2,AFCQQUNDRY6D754CR25P4MDZWGBA,2023-03-06 16:56:25.158,2,True,511
874598,3,Review from an Audio Engineer,"These little guys are definitely powerful (sort of?)… in the right hands. 3 days in, they fit awesome, haven’t run out of battery, and sound amazing; with some tweaks of course. I’ve rated this 3 stars as a general review for people who are not knowledgeable of frequency’s, EQing, and isolation, they are going to hate these. The buds are pretty much a flatline/gentle incline in frequency’s. After tinkering with the sizing of these buds and my Spotify’s EQ, I managed to get a decent/near-lossless sound from the Dime’s speakers (images attached are my Spotify’s EQ for reference).<br /><br />I will admit, I was expecting a little bit more quality ‘sound-wise’ when I purchased these, but they were extremely hot in the 2.4khz-15khz areas, and a bit lacking in the lower frequencies. This led to a very ‘tinny’ and piercing sound. I managed to fix that using Spotify’s built-in EQ feature (although you can not really bass-boost these).<br /><br />Now, after fitting them and adjusting them accordingly, they almost beat the AirPod series (my favorite general-consumer earbuds)… except there is one last thing I haven’t managed to grasp. The clipping. For those wondering, the definition of clipping is pretty much just distortion when too much power is being sent to a speaker that can’t handle that power (easiest way to explain it). Some songs in the genre that I listen to clip in random areas. I assume it’s because of the massive boost in the low-ends that I performed, and you can reduce that, but if you do, every other song besides that one song that clipped will sound off. It would be astonishing to see the sellers make a 3rd edition with a possible solid built-in EQ to prevent the very thing all consumers of this product complain about.<br /><br />Long story short: these are great if you know what you’re doing and are using a music-player with an EQ feature (like Spotify). For use on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Netflix, I would not recommend these.<br /><br />[Image key: Ver. 2 = “bass boost” Other = general use]","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41UP3MkTUtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41UP3MkTUtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41UP3MkTUtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bHKcN-qBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bHKcN-qBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bHKcN-qBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09NPCLNMN,B0B64W96HW,AE65YX3KXCPTWQLB22B5ZK3MTIDA,2023-04-09 21:36:47.445,0,False,511
247140,5,Back to the Future!,"My iPod that I bought way back in 2006 won't hold a charge long enough for a cross-country plane ride.  I could use my phone, but I like to keep my phone charged so that any airport/airline/transportation issues can be addressed with a full battery; my experience with working outlets at my seat has been fair at best.<br /><br />This little MP3 player is about the same size as my iPod but a lot thicker.  It still fits easily into a shirt pocket and will even fit into the case that holds my Sony noise-cancelling headphones.  It came with an 8GB microSD card, so I hooked it up to my computer and loaded some music.  I was pleasantly surprised at the overall sound quality.  It even has a speaker in the back in case you don't want to use headphones.  The unit includes a Bluetooth transmitter and connected easily to my headphones.  In addition to mp3 files, it will also play FLAC files.  I did not test WMA, AAC, WME, and APE files, though the listing says that they are compatible.<br /><br />You can also play videos.  First, you have to copy a program from the player to your computer.  This program is used to convert your video files so that they can be played.  I don't plan to watch videos on the tiny screen, so I did not test this function.<br /><br />I did test both the FM rado and the voice recorder.  The FM radio worked surprisingly well considering that there is no antenna.  The voice recorder also worked fine.  For the purpose I am planning, though, I'm not likely to use either feature.  The same is true of the ebook function, primarily because I just can't see myself trying to read a book on such a tiny screen.<br /><br />The only big unknown at this point is battery life.  I'm going to swap out the 8GB card for 128GB, load it up with music, charge it back to 100%, and press play.  I'll come back and update this review once I've determined the battery life.<br /><br />If you do a lot of hiking, like to listen to music while working out, or spend a lot of time on airplanes, this little mp3 player might be just what you're looking for, especially if you don't want to load up your phone with music.",[],B0BCQ3VKL6,B0BCQ3VKL6,AEBE2MSZ5WBXECIZW22C5GTT6ZLA,2023-03-02 00:31:19.941,1,False,511

The bass in these is better than most of the stereo systems I had as a teenager growing up. Better by far.<br />I've heard notes in songs I listened to since the 1970s that I never heard before. It's sort of like when CDs first came out. It's pretty unbelievable. I'm not sure I believe it yet....<br />And it's got a lifetime warranty!<br />This little set is comfortable too. As one poster put it, they are so comfortable I forgot I was wearing them. I didn't believe her then. I do now.

That is, to a company that's willing to put out something with quality without acting like all the other greedy you-know-whats in the business world. I'm sure that some day in the future their prices will increase, but I have a feeling it won't be before they've proven themselves. Good for them! I hope they wind up making millions.

858891,4,Excellent value and feature set,"[[VIDEOID:af953c86893bf829f49bb55567db64ca]] First off, let me say that this D4 microphone is a real value at under $100! I really like the stepless gain dial on the back, and the USB out to either digital or analog is next level cool. The included shock mount seems to do a very good job of isolating handling noise and vibration. The dead cat included in this package is very much appreciated. The mic itself seems very well made.<br /><br />I also like the ability to adjust the mic forward or backward depending on your needs. Push it all the way forward to leave room for your head when looking directly through the viewfinder, or move it back for better balance or to make sure the dead cat isn't in frame. Also with this adjustability, you can attach a small wireless transmitter to the ""inverted"" cold shoe mount under the mic to make this a wireless mic. That alone is a really nice feature. Also, the ability to use this D4 Mic connected directly to my computer via the USB C cable is another really cool feature.<br /><br />I did a quick audio test and also compared this D4 mic to a more expensive Rode Video Mic Pro (https://amzn.to/3JFWJDz). As I mention in my video, this isn't really fair since the Rode mic is over twice the price of the Deity D4, but I wanted to see how it would compare. Watch my video to see how it does head to head with the Rode... Spoiler Alert: The Rode has better sound, but that's to be expected. By the way, the audio in the video comparison is raw and untouched. The audio is exactly as it came out of the digital recorders and no gain or other editing has been done.<br /><br />But for the money, I think the Deity is a great choice. I mean it's a hundred bucks! The audio captured from this microphone can be improved greatly with some audio magic in post, as well. The one thing that bothers me is that no case or protective carry bag was included. This is a personal pet peeve of mine, but I always expect some kind of case included with any microphone purchase and was disappointed this mic didn't include one.<br /><br />I deducted one star for not including a case, and for having a little less audio quality than I'd hoped.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SmcPRVDDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SmcPRVDDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SmcPRVDDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71R7X9YdGIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71R7X9YdGIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71R7X9YdGIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nCkToFouL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nCkToFouL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nCkToFouL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71w-i6nsYqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71w-i6nsYqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71w-i6nsYqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814R5TKzbLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814R5TKzbLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814R5TKzbLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Dxp45SkML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Dxp45SkML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Dxp45SkML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81PZbaldibL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81PZbaldibL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81PZbaldibL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81TVbDhj4KL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81TVbDhj4KL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81TVbDhj4KL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YzEDEeKTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YzEDEeKTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YzEDEeKTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZnjwBR31L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZnjwBR31L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZnjwBR31L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81eWaiZupfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81eWaiZupfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81eWaiZupfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fAa6ZcBLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fAa6ZcBLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fAa6ZcBLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81g5JYZLuxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81g5JYZLuxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81g5JYZLuxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81izRPbnCGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81izRPbnCGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81izRPbnCGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jxB3F+WoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jxB3F+WoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jxB3F+WoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BQC57SRV,B0BQC57SRV,AF7P6F3PRRGUNG6IVHDGJ7K7PCGQ,2023-02-06 18:25:19.594,1,False,511

Another good thing is the price, very good for under $15 and the can cover the Apple Pencil if you have one.<br />So here comes the issues:<br />1. Color: it states that is rose gold, but in my opinion this is more on the gold side than rose gold, in my opinion should be more rose.<br />2.-I understand that this is for the 5th gen iPad Pro, but the cut holes for the speakers are smaller and not aligned for the 4th gen iPad, again I understand this case is intended for the 5th gen the the speakers are different size but I think considering both models are almost identical then would be nice to fit perfectly.<br />3.The hard plastic that cover the back feels thin and cheap. It is nice translucent color but honestly I don't think this will last long. I had experience with speck case that in my opinion are better quality and this hard plastic eventually break in little time.<br /><br />Because all this things, I won't be able to recommend this case.<br /><br />Update 2/11/23<br />Support Team contacted me to make things right and have a product to my entire satisfaction. They offered me a different product in exchange for nothing just to make my experience just better. I got this https://www.amazon.com/ESR-Compatible-Generation-Convenient-Attachment/dp/B08S374BVG/ref=sr_1_3?crid=U1K0PILBHVSF&keywords=esr%2Bipad%2Bpro%2B12.9%2Bcase&qid=1676062778&sprefix=esr%2B%2Caps%2C136&sr=8-3&th=1<br />I really like it, because it is similar like the apple Magic Keyboard mechanism. The only think is even that the magnet are decent strong, when the iPad is lifted from magnetic clasp, the iPad detached extremely easily, the iPad will fall and most probably damage. just a little flaw, but overall is good case.",[],B08S3HVFSK,B08S3HVFSK,AHLYKSENM2FNOQD6PNXZSWA72THQ,2023-01-25 18:12:16.625,0,True,511
937223,5,Best inexpensive laptop I've ever used,"I regularly upgrade my inexpensive secondary device so I can spend only a little each year and have the latest hardware. Each time I'm disappointed by some aspect, usually the screen, but as you can imagine there is no complaint here to be had about the<br /> screen.<br /><br />And the hardware itself is practically flawless, set aside a few minor complaints to come. The case, keyboard and TouchPad feel top notch and it's super small with pretty good battery life (I average between 5 and 6 hours). The wifi card is an Intel AX411 and is super fast, the memory and ssd are upgradable too (which I may do soon to the max 40gb RAM / 4TB NVMe). And of course the obvious positive, the screen. Just wow, super bright and very sharp with a super awesome resolution to size ratio. I keep it 120hz max res all the time and still get great battery life. The fingerprint reader works great a d I love that it has a built in Webcam cover. Enough storage out of the box to do most things, and it is incredibly fast. I never feel lag, it's basically like using my desktop as far as how snappy it is in everyday usage. Also bonus: you get a free accidental one year warranty with this laptop and some nice discounts for other software, well worth checking out.<br /><br />There are a few minor issues, but know I'm kind of nitpicking here.<br />-The speakers are decent, very loud and tunable, but they HAVE to be well tuned to get a decent sound out of them. Not the best but Def not the worst.<br />-If you're doing heavy lifting like video editing or using other pro level software, it'll get hot. The performance is great in these apps but the laptop will get hot quick. Make sure it can breathe any time you're doing heavy lifting.<br />-The gaming performance just isn't there compared to AMD APUs. If you want to game, get an AMD APU, if you want to do literally anything / everything else besides game on it this is a great option.<br /><br />Overall I love this laptop as it feels like the desktop replacement portable laptop I've always wanted. Great for video editing and audio production too. And the 5hrs+ battery life I get from it is more than adequate for my needs, luckily it has a 90w charger to charger the battery back up pretty quick too.",[],B0BF9GHTHG,B0BF9GHTHG,AHTI3CU77BXKQJYMTTVOQZ6SKCZQ,2023-01-02 00:10:48.596,2,False,511

I have 3 other NVME, samsung, sk kynix, and an intel that will boot in the same DELL 7740. But when I put this in the machine refuses to boot.<br />I tried single NVME drive mode and any combination but it will not see the drive.<br /><br />So I am not sure since the 9980H CPU and chipset is capable of seeing it and using 4tb. But both 4tb drives I got do the same thing. Refuses to be seen by the machine or even let it boot.<br /><br />If I place the drives into the USB enclosure the machine is able to see it and utilize it.<br /><br />So as of now 2 DELL 7740's can't boot with this thing in it. And all 4 NVME slots have been tried on both machines.<br /><br />Testing with a ryzen 5900x and msi x570 mobo allows me to use use the drives internally  but the reads are still below 1gb/s with writes well into the 2gb/s range.<br /><br />Drive did handle 160 GB worth of Writes in 3 files.

862718,5,A Host of Features,"This radio has versatility to compete with that of a Swiss Army Knife! The radio can use 5 sources of power (Lithium battery, AAA batteries, USB port, solar panel, hand crank) to receive AM, FM (Stereo on headphones), Shortwave (8 bands), NOAA weather radio with an alert standby mode available when not receiving other modes. It also has an LED flashlight and a loud attention getting emergency siren.<br /><br />When tuning you can step up/down and also scan up/down to the next available signal. Note that in SW mode, you can hold the Mode button for 2 seconds to be able to use Tune buttons to move to the S1-S8 band of your choice. However, once in the band of your choice, either stepping or scanning with the Tune buttons will not wrap around in the same band, but will change to the next band when you reach a band limit.<br /><br />In section 6.3 of the manual, Solar Power, reference is made to a red LED, said to be identified in Figure 1. Not shown in Figure 1, but item 19 in Figure 2 is identified as “Charging Indicator”, and when I plug a charger into the Input Port, item 18, the LED is red, but never flashed red when aiming the solar panel at the sun. My email to their Email Support address (Troubleshooting Guide, page 18 in the manual) got a prompt and courteous reply thanking me for calling attention to the oversight in the manual, and identifying the Solar Charging indicator (marked “S”) located between the headphone jack and reset button in Figure 2, but not called out in that Figure. As they told me in the email, it is a steady Orange when receiving charge from the solar panel. The photo they included in the email showed also that if you flip open both ends of the rubber cover, you can rotate it 90° to stay open. I did not know that when I took the photo included with this review. I have added, however, a callout for the “S” LED.”<br /><br />The reception on all bands compares favorably to other radios in this price range, and with 5 ways to power the radio it is great to have at home or when hiking or anywhere away from plug-in power. A fully charged battery will keep the radio playing for a lot of hours! 5 Stars for this radio.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FwKG-kCpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FwKG-kCpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FwKG-kCpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BRVQZCH9,B0BRVQZCH9,AFOFOFAEQ25E6XZJC2GX7VZNQ5SA,2023-03-10 16:28:33.830,0,False,511
897540,5,Very Capable Small PC!,"I’ve had this for about a month, and I am impressed! My purpose for getting this was that I wasn’t sure if I really wanted a Steam Deck or not... I didn’t need the portability, but I just wanted to be able to play occasional fps games in bed and not need a second gaming console. I never thought about a mini PC, and when this CTOne Mini PC popped up on an Amazon screen, I thought that this might be a better solution... it is!<br /><br />It runs Windows 11 out of the box, so after doing some minor updates and tweaks, I started loading up some games out of my collection (Fallout 4, Control, Dwarf Fortress) and hooked it up to an older 1080p TV via HDMI. I hooked up a small USB hub and a wireless controller, and it works well! I haven’t bothered to measure frame rates, but the Ryzen 5 seems to hold its own. The graphics chip is rated for 4K at 60Hz, but I’m not pushing anywhere close to that. With visual settings at medium with a couple tweaks, I’m seeing great performance for what I’m doing.<br /><br />I like that the PC has different power settings... fan noise isn’t too distracting so far. I believe you can put up to 64Gb of RAM in the machine, and I may jump to 32Gb in the Spring to run the Halo collection and some of the Borderland games. I have a spare 1Tb SSD somewhere and may add that in so I can add even more Fallout mods as I get comfortable with this machine.<br /><br />Even though I have a fairly specific use profile for this CTOne PC, I’m overall impressed by the Ryzen 5; most of my heavy computer work is done with the macOS and the new Apple M1 chips. But for simple leisure time gaming, I’ve had no issues and at 1080p I’m perfectly happy for the hour or so of gaming I can do before I crash for the night.<br /><br />The case is smaller than I expected, and I love the magnetic side panel... no fiddly clips or screws to deal with.<br /><br />If you are looking for a small form factor PC for occasional gaming like me, or for simple office work, look into this CTOne Mini PC.

624617,5,Impressive portable speaker,"I'm a music lover and amateur DJ, so I'm always in the market for a portable speaker to bring my music with me wherever I go. All my housemates have JBL speakers, but some of theirs are failing with age so I decided to put this Monster portable speaker to the test. For a portable speaker without a boombox style handle this is a little on the large / heavy side, but it comes with an optional carrying strap that can be attached to a loop on the corner of the speaker. It's slightly taller and wider than the JBL charge series, and feels much more substantial. Similar to my housemates' speakers, the Monster DNA Max is fully waterproof and dustproof with an IP67 rating, which makes it a worthy travel partner for beach trips or other outdoor activities. It's got wireless charging capabilities and comes with a Qi charging pad fitted to the oval shape of the base, but it also seems to charge effectively with other wireless charging stations. Another bonus feature is that it acts as a power bank in a pinch and can recharge a phone from the onboard battery (which lasts 15+ hours if you're just playing music).<br /><br />Now on to the important part, the sound...<br />I'm honestly impressed with the volume this portable speaker produces. Even at max volume the audio quality does not suffer, the highs and mids sound crisp and clear and the bass response is excellent without sounding muddy or rumbly. I wouldn't call it a bass-heavy speaker but found the sound to be very balanced while producing more bass than much of the competition in the portable speaker market. I prefer it to the JBL speakers for listening at home and will only choose a different portable speaker if size or weight is an issue. It doesn't offer different EQ settings and if you're looking to fine-tune your frequencies you'll have to do this from your device, but I don't mind. It's very easy to use, just plug & play. I've had no issues with the Bluetooth connection - it recognizes my phone and other devices quickly and stays connected reliably (which has been an issue with other speakers).<br /><br />Overall, it's not an audiophile quality speaker (but it's also not marketed as one), and for a consumer level portable party speaker it delivers some serious sound, in a sleek and well-designed package that feels like it will last years to come. Better than much of the competition in and above it's price range.",[],B0BTZNCF9G,B0C3Q2F13G,AHD6NVU2YCBCL5BCX5TYJZJ55J5Q,2023-03-20 10:28:47.066,0,False,511
830958,3,Not very bright and it only has up/down tilt option,"This review is for the “Mini Projector, HOMPOW Portable Projector with 100"" Screen, Native 720P Outdoor Movie Projector 7500Lux, Home Theater Projector Compatible with HDMI VGA USB TF AV for Home” I ordered. I like the compact size and quiet sound when running this projector. The instructions are easy to follow and setting up the projector is easy too. Both the instructions and projector options have multiple languages available and while the volume goes to 100, the slight incremental change could be better.<br /><br />I don’t like how long it takes to bring the volume up/down. The volume sounds okay coming from the projector but it is only high treble sounds and no bass at all. This can make a big difference when watching movies or shows. There is a headphone jack so you could hook up a better speaker option.<br /><br />The picture has several preset options for color, warmth, screen size and the ability to create your own preferences. The projector screen it comes with is okay but there are definitely better options out there. The screen is very thin so even the slightest light from behind is noticeable.<br /><br />If you’re looking to use this projector with your phone whether it be an iPhone or Android you will need to have or purchase the wiring for it because this projector doesn’t come with that wire.<br /><br />This projector doesn’t come with the two AA batteries required for the remote. I don’t like that this projector only provides the up/down tilt option and not left/right so you may have to move the projector around to get it to look right on the projector screen.<br /><br />I don’t like how much play is in the focus knob because it makes fine adjustments difficult. I also don’t like that there is not a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection to make connections easier because to update this projector you need to purchase a USB thumb drive, plug it into your computer, figure out how/where to get the update information, then plug the USB thumb drive into the projector and run it.<br /><br />This isn’t the worst projector I’ve seen or used and it’s certainly not in the top category but I can be a decent option for indoor use in a very dark room.

Picking this set up at such an affordable price is almost criminal.<br /><br />EA500 is one of the best sounding single DDs I've ever heard since the Tanchjim Oxygen (which is nearly 3-4 times the price). All the audiophile OGs will perk up a bit because Oxygen is a legend in the iem landscape.<br /><br />Finally found an Oxygen (& Vortex) beater! In fact she easily holds her own (and some) with her older brother the Simgot Pound-4-Pound Sonic Grand Champ (EA2000, more pricey at $320).<br /><br />E2000 adds some additional impact, texture, and power to the bass while adding some extra special sauce to mid frequencies.<br /><br />Right OOTB she begins to beguile you with the effortless way she shapes and carves out sound. She cast a spell on you with her pitch, timbre, & tonal perfection. Some may consider her bright but you have the choice to swap sound tube nozzles (red is my preference) to transform the sound.<br /><br />Tanchjim Oxygen, Penon Vortex, Oriolus Isabellae, Tanchjim Hana 2021, & Tripowin Olina SE were my DD standard bearers but now... Simgot Twins (EA2000 & EA500) lead the way through the ranks of today's DDs.<br /><br />Crisp, precise, airy, space-shaping, shimmering, clarity, details, spacious with gorgeous vocals; wrapped up with pronounced, speedy, tight, and impactful bass.

207514,2,Where's the bass??,"On first impression, I thought the design language was very cool. The driver case looks sort of futuristic. However, it does stand out and it’s not all that subtle. I appreciate the white/gray color and the orange accents and orange neckband certainly give them a sporty look. As far as comfort, these are OK. I can feel the drivers on the side and the neckband is a bit rigid. I would’ve liked a softer or adjustable band. This makes resting my head back uncomfortable. Also, it can be cumbersome to wear these if you have glasses (the headset needs to go first). However, the headset does stay in place while doing moderate exercise or movements.<br /><br />They feature Bluetooth 5.3, and they connected seamlessly to my Android and iOS devices. The connection was solid, even at respectable distances. There were no discernable lag or sync issues. The battery life is decent, and they charge via USB-C.<br /><br />Honestly, I had high expectations for this headset. I already own both bone and air conduction headphones, and by looking at the marketing material, these looked promising. Unfortunately, I must say that I was let down somewhat. Having 4 driver units, I expected much better bass than other single-driver options. The bass is basically non-existent, making all audio sound tinny and distant. The midrange was there, as well as the treble, but since there is no bass, the highs are overly accentuated at higher volumes, and it became harsh and fatiguing fast. It’s almost like listening to a transistor radio. The sense of openness that open headsets bring was also disappointing. It seemed as if I was listening to elevator music. Even dialogue-based content sounded as if I was listening to a phone speaker. I can deal with that, but I think I should not have to settle. The good thing is that at least you can be aware of your surroundings, sound leakage is kept to a minimum, and that there is no vibrating sensation usually caused by bone inductors (strange that the product’s page references bone-induction as a feature).<br /><br />It may be obvious by now that I am not all that happy with these headphones. I hope that this is just my unit, and somehow they are defective. While they are inexpensive, I think spending a bit more could perhaps be a better option if you are looking for open true wireless headsets.",[],B09Y5S28F7,B0BTM1DTM7,AFBNFPKKRALQZ2BHYOMHTZNVQV7Q,2023-02-21 17:19:01.166,0,False,511
913954,5,Very well made and sturdy. High quality for the price.,"I will start by saying that I like iWillink products and have had good luck with them in the past. While I typically use actual punch down panels, I am beginning to appreciate the pass through style like this one. Overall, this one is very well made, super sturdy, comes with all 48 coupler inserts that you will need pre-installed, includes the cage nuts and screws for mounting, and cable ties for securing your cables to the back bar. For installations where you are going to need to potentially add more cables later or may need to relocate/rearrange cables, this style patch panel is great, as you can move things around without risking pulling connections loose (which I have had happen before MANY times on punchdown panels). These also work great in ""clean up"" installations where people had previously terminated all the network cables with RJ45 connectors and plugged them directly into the switch. With one of these you can relocate all those network connectors to a proper panel front! Another thing I like is that the keystone couplers on this panel are removable, which means that I can swap in others of different colors for easy reference, or swap in other standard keystones like USB3 or HDMI for easy connections to a server (which might be inside a locked anti-theft cage and hard to access).<br /><br />All that said, I do have a couple of very minor issues with this panel. First, while the keystones are removable, they are VERY tight and you will definitely need a screwdriver and a bit of force to get them to release, so plan on putting in the keystones you think you will need before you mount the panel, as it will be a royal pain to change out the jacks themselves later (cables will be easy to swap around, it is just the keystones that are a bit of a tight fit). The other issue is that I really wish the back bar had screws to where you could remove it as it adds about 3"" of extra depth to the panel and could preclude some mounting situations (specifically, ""cleanup"" installs that are located on either very shallow wall mount racks or, in at least a few cases, between 2x4's).

My garage faces the east and gets hit with the early morning rising sun, up until almost 11 am, so this panel gets plenty of exposure to recharge the battery. Also, thanks to the location under the overhang, it's better protected from severe weather and should survive the crazy hailstorms of southern Colorado.<br /><br />So far, it's keeping my battery at 100% as Colorado has a lot of sunny days. You may need to have the panel exposed for more of the day to achieve a full charge.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-All hardware needed to install the mount is included in the box. Just predrill your holes, and if need install the wall anchors, then mount.<br />-Includes two security wires to make it a bit more difficult for someone to run off with your camera.<br />-Mount is easily adjustable<br />-13ft cable<br />-4W max output is plenty for second gen Nest cameras<br /><br />Negatives:<br />-The cable is hardwired to the solar panel so if it gets damaged, you may be out of luck with a repair. It'd been great to have a screw-together waterproof connection that's found on a lot of outdoor light sets.<br /><br />Considerations:<br />-The 13ft cable may get in the way or be hard to hide. Being under my garage's soffit, I simple zip tied the wire to some metal hooks I screwed into the soffit.<br />-This is not meant to charge a fully dead or almost dead battery! This is by design as the panel is a trickle-charger. You'll need to remove the camera or use an external battery a t a high enough wattage with the correct cable to charge it in place.<br />-Don't expect this to pay for itself, even at just $43.99 when reviewed.<br /><br />Overall, I can highly recommend this panel if you need to power a Nest camera in a strange or hard to reach location.<br /><br />I may get another camera and another of these panels to mount on my shed... hmmm.",[],B0BHV9GTSS,B0BHV965K1,AE7RH2BM22UZAZTXSJUF2ZGXSKSA,2023-03-10 05:30:35.998,0,False,511
274590,5,Perfect enclosure and it is great to restore deleted files unlike a thumb drive.,"I recently purchased the SSK Aluminum M.2 to USB NVMe SATA SSD Enclosure Reader from Amazon for $18.99, and I must say that I am quite impressed with the product. The enclosure works beautifully, just as advertised. However, some people complain about the top speed of the device not reaching full potential, but it's important to keep in mind that it states the top speed is 10gb/s, and the drive needs other efficient hardware to reach full potential.<br />(I just noticed in my pic the particular PC I am using has a USB-C that I am not plugged in to which would speed this drive up, it is nice to have it be able to plug in both types)<br /><br />While some people have complained about the tiny thumb screw, I believe it's understandable given the size of the drive and enclosure itself. The product is priced reasonably at $16-20, so I don't think people should be whining about it. The USB-A and C cables included with the product worked just fine for me, although they are a bit short.<br /><br />I purchased this product to expand an additional SSD hard drive in my computer that I installed games on, and it was great. I was able to copy my existing SSD drive onto a new expanded size Drive and then place what was in the enclosure in my computer. I took out the SSD that wasn't my computer and now I have a massively sized external hard drive to play around with. It was definitely worth the money.<br /><br />One thing to note is that unlike a thumb drive, files that are deleted do not permanently disappear. They are put in a trash can, and you can restore or undelete the file by pressing Ctrl Z.<br /><br />Overall, I'm quite happy with my purchase of the SSK Aluminum M.2 to USB NVMe SATA SSD Enclosure Reader. It works great, is slim and easy to use, and has a solid drive holder that is not going to slip or come loose. The holding screw is a bit tricky to install, but once it's done, it's great. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a slim M2 enclosure for their backup or just a huge USB thumb nail type drive with tons of storage.<br /><br />Make sure to use the ""Safely remove hardware"" function to unplug this, or turn the PC off before unplugging to prevent corrupting the drive.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51pL2WmPSpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51pL2WmPSpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51pL2WmPSpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61T6Vb-pJeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61T6Vb-pJeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61T6Vb-pJeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VO3+DS09L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VO3+DS09L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VO3+DS09L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0892BK5L6,B08VX11ZQY,AEOP7CZTXKOW2QZLXHPIY2IGVPOA,2023-03-27 18:32:17.922,0,True,511
177161,4,Improved online meetings and webinars,"I was using some earbud headset that came with a phone for online meetings, and I was having difficulty understanding 100% of what presenters were saying, especially colleagues whose native language is not English. This headset has cleared that up.<br /><br />FORM AND FIT<br />These are on-ear rather than over-ear. I've never had one like it and was skeptical about comfort. I had to experiment a bit, but since the ear cups swivel front to back I eventually found a sweet spot that stays in place and is comfortable. The microphone boom swivels enough that you can have it one either side, unlike some others I've had. The smaller footprint compared to the over-ear type feels less cluttering in my home office.<br /><br />COMFORT: It's ""good enough"" for most situations. So far the longest meeting was just short of 2 hours. I was ready for a break after that, but there was nothing especially irritating, just normal fatigue. Better than I expected for the price. The earphone padding is a thin soft and rubber-like substance. It's better than I expected, but from experience that kind of material doesn't tend to hold up well to a lot of use. Time will tell.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY:<br />My hobby is audio engineering. I didn't expect these to be good for music, and they aren't, though they're better than I expected. The higher frequencies are lacking, but that's because the maker has zeroed in on human voice frequencies. The improvement in clarity in online meetings over what I was using is VERY noticeable. Possibly the noise cancelling feature also helps? The microphone is good as well. Colleagues noticed that I sounded better the first meeting where I used it.<br /><br />DOWNSIDES:<br />I could wish that an adapter to USB C was included, but a those are cheap and easy to find. Also, even though the audio plug type is the same as another headset that works with my older MacBook Pro, this headset's mic isn't recognized so I can only use it on the Windows laptop I have for work.<br /><br />In general, it's made online meetings less fatiguing because I don't have to concentrate so hard to pick up everything speakers are saying. I'm satisfied with the value for the price. Seems to stack up well against famous brands like Logitech.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CdT53rWrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CdT53rWrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CdT53rWrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09B9PCYSS,B0BZ7M9HXJ,AFTXEHB4X7LHWDDWQMRPQO4IJPYQ,2023-02-23 18:23:12.386,8,True,511
693425,4,"Great earbuds, but not my fav","I had the Sony XM4s and stupidly lost them.  I was quite happy with them, but figured I'd try something new and got the Bose QC2s.  At its best, the QC2s produce a great sound, really heavy bass, and the noise cancellation is fantastic.  But, I think the XM4s are better all-around earbuds.  I wear them daily in NYC, and the range of noises constantly being thrown at me make the XM4s better suited.<br /><br />Noise Cancellation: on planes, the QC2s are unreal - that background hum of the engines just totally disappears.  At home, the QCs let me focus when my stupid robot vacuum is circling my desk.  But, for some noises, particularly higher pitch noises, they get right through the ANC. At their best, the XM4s don't cancel noise nearly as well as the QCs, but they filter more of it across the spectrum.  For low frequencies, the QCs are a 10/10 and the XM4s are like a 7/10.  For higher frequencies, the QCs are a 4/10 but the XM4s are still a 7/10 - subway noise, construction noise, and wind cuts right through the QC's ANC, whereas the XM4s are able to block out much of it.  For wind noise, the XM4s weren't great, but the QCs are almost unbearable. In high wind conditions (like on a bike) I would just turn the ANC off on my XM4s, but you don't have that ability on the QCs, so you have to just deal.<br /><br />Sound Quality: for certain types of music (dance, hip hop, techno - bass heavy stuff), the QCs are on top - great, immersive sound. But the XM4s have a much more well-rounded sound that work with every type of music - I feel like I hear sounds I never noticed before.<br /><br />Fit: QCs are more customizable and feel more comfortable. The XM4s require more frequency fiddling to keep them securely in place with a good seal.<br /><br />App: The Sony app is so much more customizable and fully featured, but honestly I turned off most of the more advanced features. If you favor simplicity, the Bose is better.",[],B0B4PSQHD5,B0BFW3RLZ7,AEAKL7DA7DLNDLU465ATZ6HLBC7A,2023-04-11 16:55:26.402,0,False,511
497793,4,"Works well, but no documentation","The card is working well for what I need, which is eSATA ports.  (5 stars)  However, it did require me to figure out a few things on my own because no documentation came with it.  (-1 star)<br /><br />Package Contents<br /><br />The packaging was soft (not rigid), but it appears that the card was unharmed in transit.  I received the card (wrapped in an anti-static inside the package) as well as a mini CD (80mm diameter) that was not in any kind of protective cover or sleeve.  The CD contains several different drivers without a clear indication of which was the correct one for this card.<br /><br />Installing the Driver<br /><br />Without the Driver on my new Windows 11 PC, the device did not appear to be recognized by my computer.  I had not figured out which device to look for in Device Manager until after I had the driver installed, so it's possible that the extra driver is not required.  On the driver CD, I figured out that the driver is the one inside the ""ASM1061 Sata6GB"" folder.  I had to go into the only subfolder (asmedia_106x_3.0.2) and run the ""setup.exe"" program.  The installation was straightforward.  Once the driver was installed, I found the ""Asmedia 106x SATA Controller"" device inside the ""Storage controllers"" section of Device Manager.<br /><br />Configuring for eSATA<br /><br />There are two sets of jumpers on the card.  In the default position (all covering the top two pegs), the SATA ports on the top of the card are active and the eSATA ports on the side of the card are inactive.  Moving the jumpers to the lower position (all covering the bottom two pegs) turns off the SATA ports and turns on the eSATA ports.  It appears possible to have one SATA and one eSATA port active, but I switched both to eSATA for my use, so have not tested this.  The jumpers on the left appear to select either the left SATA or the top eSATA port.  The jumpers on the right appear to select either the right SATA or the bottom eSATA port.<br /><br />Hopefully this helps anyone else who might purchase this card.",[],B0BD8NV7K6,B0BD8NV7K6,AFM2ETNH2HSD6FGH6BY2ZBXIJXDQ,2023-02-26 20:55:19.354,0,True,511
895885,4,"Very Compact, But to Wake Alexa You Have to Shout","I'd been using another brand of compact Alexa-enabled clock on my bedside table, but as the digits started to fade the last couple of years, I found the original company no longer offered the clock. I really liked having Alexa to set simple timers (okay, I admit it - I like to take naps). I found this clock as a replacement, and it added new features that my old clock lacked! So let's take a look at those features:<br /><br />The Clock - It's big enough to see on your night table, even without your glasses. And it has a great range of settings, including one that is automatic. Being an Internet clock, you don't have to reset it twice a year like most clocks. If all you need is a reliable, readable clock, this is for you.<br /><br />Day of the Week - As it turns out, the clock eventually comes to figure this out by itself. I expected this to happen right away, but it took my clock overnight to put the day of the week on the display. Also, unfortunately, the font is so small that I can't read it without my classes.<br /><br />Temperature and Humidity - The clock gets the outdoor temperature and humidity from the Internet. Nice to know information, and the font is large enough to read without my glasses. It takes a little poking around in the Alexa app to get this feature working, but once you have it set up it works fine.<br /><br />Weather - The clock also gets the weather from the Internet, but the icons are so small I'd need a magnifying glass to see them. So it works, but is hardly useful for me.<br /><br />Alexa - Alexa is available and it works; the trouble is that the clock is hard of hearing. To get Alexa's attention, you literally need to yell at the clock. I'm not talking about raising your voice; I'm talking about yelling so  loud that people if other rooms of the house wonder what's wrong. Now there is an Alexa button on the top of the clock you can press, but that's not near as easy as saying, ""Alexa, set an alarm in one hour."" There are also buttons that let you raise and lower the volume, and turn Alexa off entirely.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say the clock is a good value, as long as those little foibles don't get in your way.",[],B09LRJWCPB,B09PHPN4R1,AFKKUEAQ7D3TTT7ACTK7O2MUZB4Q,2023-02-28 00:13:42.348,4,True,511
804392,4,How to drastically improve VOLUME and BASE,"These bone induction headphones are a compromise, they offer the ability to listen to audio without having something jammed in or covering your ear, this provides significantly better comfort, durability, and of course situational awareness. However, the cons are somewhat limited volume and the rich bass tones are severely limited. As others have also mentioned the volume is less than even typical earbuds, even with the volume cranked all the way it is only mildly loud, and they start to vibrate a lot which tickles your ears.<br />SHOKZ does recommend using ear plugs (when appropriate) to lower background noise. When I tried this it took away some of the high frequencies as well. I just figured I would need to use a second standard headphone set for those times when I really wanted to immerse myself with loud and rich music sound and use the SHOKZ for times when I need and want the added durability, comfort, and situational awareness these provide.<br />However, I had this pair of swimmer ear plugs (Hearprotek model HP13) that are designed to block water but let most sound in for hearing (they work well for that). When I put these in with the SHOKZ it was a bit of a shock, bass and overall volume increased A LOT. I usually have the volume at 80-100% (to the point that I get a lot of vibration), however with these ear plugs in that high of a volume would blow your ears out. I had to turn it down to 40-50%, and the bass is now like a typical ear bud. So, if that is important to you, here is a solution.<br />These earplugs do work as advertised, I can hear almost as well with them in as out. However, with the SHOKZ playing it does make it hard to hear anything else. So, using these vastly improves the sound, but now once again you have something jammed in your ear, and your situational awareness is significantly reduced so...<br />It also does not transform it into a high end set of earphones (I don’t want to oversell it), it just gives back a lot of the bass and volume lost due to open ear bone acoustics. It might be a decent alternative to having to have two different types of earphones. Also, there are several different earplugs that are tuned for listening to loud music, perhaps one of those might work even better? If I try any others I will update.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71j8BBjxOsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71j8BBjxOsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71j8BBjxOsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09BVYBS4J,B09F2YQQ1B,AGQNN2RRHJN3S54T6AP24CGKJNZA,2023-04-16 22:40:12.065,1,True,511
58584,5,Great gaming processor,"Upgraded from an i7-8700k that I've been using since summer of 2018, and the difference in just about every game is noticeable.  The biggest one lately was Returnal, which just released for PC and was giving me a lot of stuttering.  Even though the in-game benchmark was telling me I was GPU bound, I was also seeing that my GPU utilization was only hitting 98% on every run.  I'd been looking to upgrade anyways, but I wanted to wait for the new AMD X3D chips to be released and see how they performed.  Since those came out at such a high price point, and they were only marginally better than this chip was for gaming according to most YouTube reviewers who ran comparisons between them all, I decided to stick with Intel for another generation.<br /><br />When I installed everything and ran Returnal again the stuttering was gone.  Between the better overall performance of this chip, as well as the newer platform offering support for resizable bar with my 3080ti, I was seeing about an 8% overall improvement in average FPS and my 1% lows were more than double what they used to be with the 8700k.  I fired up a few other games and immediately noticed much smoother frametimes, even if my average FPS wasn't that much better than before, indicating that my CPU was no longer holding back the performance of my GPU and causing random hitches in performance.<br /><br />Something to keep in mind is that this CPU runs HOT.  I upgraded my AIO cooler from a 240mm EVGA to a 360mm Arctic Liquid Freezer II because it uses a thicker radiator and comes highly recommended by people who tend to overclock their computers.  I haven't bothered overclocking yet, but I will probably get into that once my system has been broken in a bit more and the thermal paste has been given time to fully cure.  Even then, running Cinebench in a case with a lot of airflow, I was seeing temps get up to 85 and 90C on all the performance cores.  Considering the CPU package was pulling 233W under full load, it's no surprise that it had a lot of heat to dissipate.<br /><br />Overall I'm very impressed with this processor.  It's met and exceeded all of my expectations, and if you can tame the heat it puts out you'll get all the frames you'll need when you pair it with a powerful GPU.",[],B0BCDL7F5W,B0C1ZR8CH3,AH5OQSQMFRYV2XSFLDJDWODXUJGA,2023-03-06 23:47:54.684,5,True,511
913943,4,Really good range. Works fine with BT headset. Questionable driver support.,"I primarily got this to use on my office desktop to get me better range with my Bluetooth headset, and for that is seems to work great. Compared to my older Bluetooth adapter, I would say the range is easily 2x-3x as good (using it, my headset was now able to connect from anywhere in the house and didn't start dropping out until I went outside and walked to the end of my driveway). I also like that it has a detachable antenna, which means I could potentially put an even bigger one on it for even more range.<br /><br />Initial setup on my Windows 10 desktop was a bit of a headache though. Before I could get anything to work, I had to go through and remove ALL of my paired Bluetooth devices (with the old adapter still installed), remove the old adapter, and then put this adapter in, let Windows detect it and install the driver, and then re-pair my devices.<br /><br />For my headset and some external speakers, everything seems to be working great, but with a Bluetooth mouse it seems to lag a bit and has even higher latency than my old adapter did. Based on a bit of quick sleuthing, it seems that this adapter still uses the original Microsoft Bluetooth driver from 2006 and that its support for Bluetooth 5.3 is a bit...lacking. While it works, it seems to be operating in compatibility mode for an earlier standard and not running at full speed. After checking the VID and PID on this adapter and doing some online research, the ATS2851 chipset in this adapter is the same one that is used in other adapters that have a lot of people complaining about latency issues with mice, game controllers, etc and begging for a custom driver to fix the issues. Unfortunately, so far the only drivers that appear to be available for this adapter are the built-in ones from Microsoft, which do not appear to operate it at full speed. I also went back and re-tested this on my laptop (after disabling the internal Bluetooth adapter) and saw the exact same issues.<br /><br />So...if you are simply looking for long range on a Bluetooth adapter with something like a headset, this seems to work great, but for other devices like hand controllers, mice, etc the latency seems to be higher than it should be and I think they really need to release some custom drivers. I also feel this device is priced a bit higher than it should be, though the external antenna does mitigate the price somewhat.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cMoquGjiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cMoquGjiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cMoquGjiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nX+n3vJ-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nX+n3vJ-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nX+n3vJ-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fTz7Jpp3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fTz7Jpp3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fTz7Jpp3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BXRXFPFW,B0BXRXFPFW,AFDCRITLV6WGYKTAJAAMMSPWRTZQ,2023-03-31 19:19:49.231,0,False,511
615556,4,What a great surprise birthday present!,"I have to admit I am a self proclaimed audiophile, so my standards for music reproduction are high. I own Wired Sennheiser 650s as well as wired Bose Quiet Comfort noise canceling cans, or the full headphones over the ear units. I am not convinced in any manner that wireless headphones or earbuds can not compete with the full sound that a wire connection can provide. So not even the all mighty Bluetooth 5.0 despite fancy bandwidth numbers can compete with well constructed wired units.<br /><br />Now on to the review of the JBL quantum one headphones/headset. First let me say that with the USB connection is the only way to maximize the ability of these cans. The 3.5 mm wire connector is absolutely wonderful but the lack of the noise canceling it (depending on how damaged your ears are) hurts the wonderful sound reproduction.<br /><br />The Quantum software that integrates all of the features of the headset. Such as the 360° audio, the simulated 7.1 surround sound and head orientation option that it offers. Again only applicable with the USB-A to USB-C cable. And the biggest hit is maybe not a hit is not using that USB cable you have no balance control between the game and the headset; the cable has a knob on it that allows you to give more volume to music or the voices you may be talking to via the very easy to remove and replace microphone. So if you're looking for a top notch multimedia headset one with a good mic the USB issue is a non factor for the home office/ multi-player experience.<br /><br />To finish this off if you have any real knowledge in fine speaker sound reproduction JBL is tied up at the top of the list for quality. If you've got access to hi-fidelity music; meaning lossless compression formats such as DSD or FLAC to name just a few these cans will not disappoint in any connection method to them. (Anyway do you really need your head to light up like the club in RGB colors?)

But with many different devices it can also mean having to bring multiple cables with me which adds to the bulk in my bag. So when I saw the LISEN 4 in 1 Multi Charging Cable it caught my attention. I have grown to know and trust LISEN as a brand for their value, innovation and quality though a number of purchases I have done over the past year (Wall chargers and a magnetic phone holder for the car). This product lives up to and honestly even surpasses my expectations.<br /><br />First you have so much flexibility USB-C to USB-C, USB-C to Lightning, USB-A to USB-C and USB-A to Lightning, What this means is, I only need to put this one cable in my bag to travel with.<br /><br />The first thing that you’ll notice is that this is a retractable cable. It adjusts to 5 different lengths (according to the specs - 0.65ft-1.3ft-2ft-2.62ft-3.3ft - I took multiple pictures and edited them together to show the difference). The main cable is USB-C on both ends and one end has a lightning adapter while the other end has a USB-A adapter. These are attached to the cable with a sliding attachment so that if you’re not using them you can slide them out of the way. It also will keep the adapters from being lost.<br /><br />The other great thing about the design is that depending on the connectors that you use it can deliver higher amounts of power to your device. C to C gives 60W max - enough to power my MacBook Air M1, and C to L gives 27W max.<br /><br />I have used the cord with my Samsung S21 Ultra as well as my iPad Pro and AirPod Pros and it does great. I love that it can give me up to 1 meter of length when I need it, or retract to the minimum length when I don’t want to deal with the cords.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for anyone that needs to take a charger with them on the go.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xwVN-rsYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xwVN-rsYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xwVN-rsYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BPBP61GQ,B0BPBP61GQ,AFIYHXW7WSLJGJVEMMYT2C3T23IA,2023-03-16 17:57:18.995,1,True,510
312703,5,No chemical off-gassing smell! Yay!,"My husband works in a secure facility with frequent 16 hour shifts. He has to put everything he needs during his shift, including his lunch and drinks, in a clear bag. As such, they take a beating and we've been through a lot of bags over the years. This one seems fairly well made and is decently sized.<br /><br />The front zippered pocket will be good for papers and small things that aren't super thick. The zipper here and on the main compartment moves smoothly and freely.<br /><br />Having used bags in this style before, one thing I really like about this one is the strap inside the main compartment that attaches to the pocket with velcro. Seems like a simple small thing, right? The last backpack my husband used didn't have one, and after months of use the pocket kind of stayed open and stretched outward and was constantly in the way when trying to put anything in the larger main compartment. This simple little elastic strap with velcro will keep that from happening with this bag.<br /><br />The little mesh pocket in the main compartment also has velcro closure. I don't know what my husband will use it for, but it'll be good for anyone who needs this for school or work and needs a place to store things that is slightly more discreet. Sure, contents are still visible when inspected or if you look closely, but it's slightly more discreet than the front compartment for storing tampons, pads, medications, etc.<br /><br />The bag was shipped in a nice little box inside an Amazon box rather than just a plastic bag that likely would have then been put in a plastic mailer. This is a nice touch, though it likely costs the seller more, but it ensures the bag doesn't get ripped or punctured during shipping. The thing I was most happy (and surprised) about was the lack of smell! We've bought bags in the past that had to be left outside or in the garage to off-gas for days before they were usable. Not the case with this bag! You should be able to use it immediately.<br /><br />My husband's current bag still has some life left, so he's not switching to this one immediately (I like to always have a new one on hand in case the current one gets ripped) so I can't speak to longevity yet, but I'll be sure to come back and update once he puts it into use if it doesn't live up to expectations.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+cmE1WoUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+cmE1WoUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+cmE1WoUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71829X7iMUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71829X7iMUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71829X7iMUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FEXw-KmSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FEXw-KmSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FEXw-KmSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71W+7xeGNqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71W+7xeGNqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71W+7xeGNqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qRGmD9zjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qRGmD9zjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qRGmD9zjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vfz8C8T2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vfz8C8T2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vfz8C8T2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fR0rAqCcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fR0rAqCcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fR0rAqCcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BPCHYNKS,B0BRQD439Q,AGC2YYQQH6GB2LUBH3ZD7KT3W6QQ,2023-01-26 08:01:04.798,3,False,510
466213,2,Screws too short to be usable.,"Unfortunately, this didn't work for what I was hoping to use it for (a Cisco CBS350 switch for which the relevant parts seem to be unavailable at any price).  Unfortunately, there were a number of critical dimensions not posted that I needed, so I ended up ordering it and hoping for the best.  With these plates, you'd end up drilling the plate slightly for both screws unless you want to mount it at an angle, and it would be set back a lot (similar to the factory mounting bracket.  But it could be used.<br /><br />The reason for my bad rating is that the screws that come with this are worthless.  They *barely* stick through the metal plate, sticking out only about 2mm beyond the other side, which is grossly inadequate, and would strip out very easily.  The recommended minimum amount of thread contact is 1.5 x the screw diameter.  So for an M4 screw, you should have at least 6mm of screw sticking into the machine, not 2mm.<br /><br />In fact, the 4mm screws didn't even start to grip the threads on my Cisco switch, and that's probably true for almost anything you could screw them into.  But even if they did, you could strip out 2mm of threads in one second flat.<br /><br />I really can't imagine what they were thinking when they made the screws so short.<br /><br />Other info:<br /><br />Before I ordered this, I asked a question about the dimensions, and got no answers.  Here are the missing critical dimensions that I needed, but were unavailable, just in case it helps somebody else in the future:<br /><br />1.  Maximum distance between screws:<br /><br />The distance from the outermost point of one slot's curve to the outermost point on the other slot's curve is about 75 mm.  Subtract the screw diameter from that  number to get the minimum distance from hole to hole.  So if you're using an M4 screw, it would be about 71mm.<br /><br />2.  Minimum distance between screws:<br /><br />The distance from the innermost point to the innermost point is about 6 mm.  Add the screw diameter to that number to get the minimum distance from hole to hole.  So for an M4 screw, the minimum distance would be about 10mm.",[],B0B6RPMQYR,B0BV74HPBY,AE2QUSR7PRLVVWZJGCDHWW7EMGTA,2023-01-16 03:04:24.721,0,True,510
527648,1,"looking for the bare minimum, here it is","I was given this projector as a gift from my daughter for Christmas. She has a part-time job so it took her a while to save for this gift along with others for the family. Why do I bring this up, because I think it was not worth the money spent on it.<br /><br />As with many other electronic products you purchase on-line, many of us have certain expectations, like batteries for the the remote control, or the necessary cables to connect the projector to your laptop, etc. etc. Well, the GPX Mini Projector with Bluetooth, doesn't offer any of that. When I opened the box, I expected everything to be there for me to give it a test run. What I found was a LARGE system, not mini by any stretch of the imagination, and no HDMI or USB cables. Instead I found RCA cables, yes you read that correctly, RCA cables. I have not seen those for about a decade and I can't think of a single system that still uses those cables on modern laptops.<br /><br />Needles to say I hid my shock from my daughter and grabbed the remote control which did not have batteries. As with may other electronics we purchase I went looking for the batteries when to my surprise, I didn't see any. So, I went out and purchased HDMI cables and triple A batteries to use the projector. The Bluetooth feature is great but it doesn't work very well. There was a delay between the sound and the picture which did nothing but frustrate me even more. Now I will say that the Bluetooth feature must be on steroids because I was getting devices from my neighbors which was very uncomfortable when they asked if we were trying to watch something using Bluetooth. They said their system would turn on and start playing whatever we were trying to watch. VERY UNCOMFORTABLE indeed. Next was the HDMI outlet, which had trouble holding the weight of the HDMI cable. You have to stand there and wiggle it until you get a connection.<br /><br />In summary<br />1. the projector is large - not mini<br />2. no HDMI and USB cables<br />3. RCA cables included which is outdated technology for laptops<br />4. no batteries for the remote control<br />5.

Here is the major issue. I purchased this item, the echo show and it didn't work. I did every step of every troubleshooting method available. 5 factory resets and spoke with customer care rep gave all the information for that person to tell me that my serial number isn't right when i typed it out to them could not use the screen at all and was just stuck on one screen and for the rep to tell me that my order id wasn't right sent me links that you couldn't click on to send the pictures to show them the issue and i also did all the same measures on the alexa app and i even looked it up but all of the instructions are the same but when you can't get passed one screen to any thing up every method of trying you can't do because it wont get past the main screen. Never mind the fact the ""instruction"" manual is only 3 pages with no troubleshooting pages, no information on who to contact or what steps to take to fix the issue.. completely useless.  piss poor execution of what could have been an excellent product but between a manual with zero helpful information,alexa support staff who was not helpful at all,and  getting a defective product.. which i get will happen from time to time because nothing is perfect. but the fact that you ""online support"" is quoting a google search is ridiculous. any consumer would and should expect more from a massive corporation such as amazon. then receiving several surveys after every attempt to make contact with a real person and asking if it was helpful or they resolved the issue is pointless after submitting one of them.  i will say i use amazon for damn near everything and typically have an ok experience but part of any business is know the harsh truths about products,usability,customer service, consumer options and most importantly quality and professionalism and making sure the consumer has a good easy experience to remain a repeat customer. this does not mean i will never use use amazon again but i feel like things like this are important to know so thank for letting me share this experiance with you and i hope it is helpful to minimize issues in the future",[],B08J8FFJ8H,B08XVF418R,AFPS7T5Z6XTVHSPZHAGAXH7J5ZMA,2023-01-26 10:23:07.390,4,True,510
73228,3,Does not hold charge well,"Ordered this in a comboination set with the Ring Stick Up Camera.  The panel is smaller than my previous Ring panels and only hold 1.9W.  My previous panels were 5W and maintained near 100% all day and night.  Compared to my 3 other Ring Stick Up Camera panels in the front yard/driveway this panel maintains lower solar power continuously and never gets a full charge in the daytime.  At this moment my device health shows my 3  panels are at 95% and its 5 pm while the smaller panel is showing 85%.  Im just used to seeing my panels at 100% charged at night compared to this one.  It is still a good panel but not as powerful as the higher rated panels.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/12/2023 -  Melissa from Ring Support called me after noting the decrease in solar efficiency as I had mentioned before.  It was down to 70% as the it was on battery power and trickling down from on 85% before.  So I moved the solar panel to more sun efficiency on my patio roof awning.  After 4 hrs still no improvement.  Then I manually charged the battery with the USB cord and after it charged up I re-inserted battery into my Ring Stick up camera. I had noticed on my other Ring camera's solar panels the device<br />health that indicated all my 3 other cameras had the statement (below the solar status)  ""A Ring solar accessory  is connected and able to charge this device"", and it showed the word ""connected"" in green.  My patio camera did not have that at all.  While it showed the words ""connected"" it was not in green as the others.  So I checked the USB optional cord going into the camera.  I pulled it out and re-connected it and saw that the word ""connected"" was now in green as well as the statement below the solar status.  I had inserted the optional USB cord incorrectly into the camera initially, not knowing it was either not seated correctly or inserted correctly.  This led to the battery slowly decreasing unaware that I was the problem by not having the USB optional cord correctly seated. Now the device health is where it should be.  (My RSI is strong at 44-51 as well).  I mentioned the steps I took to alleviate this mistake on my part so other people could trouble shoot as well if you run into similar problem.

386175,5,"Wonderful addition to the S4 tablet, but there is one BIG flaw.","This is such a nice addition to the S4 tablet. I really love how handy and conveniant it keeps a physical keyboard. I love being able to hope to physical keys for long typing situations when I need to. The keys feel nice, for a membrane type keyboard. A decent bit of travel in such a small form factor. While a bit on the small side, the keyboard is quite easy to type on. Its familiar enough to jump between pc typing and portable typing. It would be a huge improvement to bave a bit of a backlight for the keys. Sometimes, when its dim, you dont want to be blinded by the wonderful screen, just to type on this thing. But normally I try not to type in the dark. One odd thing I run into, sometimes keys seem to be ignored. I am not sure why, and also holding shift and hitting space too quick as you release shift. That will ignore the shift keys normal action and change the keyboard language. If you have multiple languages installed. If not, you will see your selected lanuage pop up in a toast notification at the bottom of the screen constantly.<br /><br />The magnetic lock keeps the keyboard and tab tightly connected while laying in place. Also it has magnets that keep the fold cover cosed over the screen too. No batteries, YAY! It connects to the tab with pin that interface with recessed pads on the side of the tablet itself. Keep those pins on the side of the tablet clean, else this keyboard will do noting. So those pins supply power, and data from the keyboard to the tablet. No BT or any wireless connections to fuss with. Snap the tablet into the dock, keyboard is active and ready to go, when yer done. Lift the tablet and its disconnected. Done. Tho I have had little trouble with that.<br /><br />If it had a backlight, would totally be almost perfect, BUT there is one biiiiig flaw. I have noticed the keyboard's tablet dock area will damage your screen. So a screen protector is a MUST to have with the keyboard cover. I have a faint line on my screen that is permanently there. When the screen is on, its not seen. But is noticeable when off. It was hard to take a picture of tho.<br /><br />With that in mind, I would totally reccomend this keyboard cover.

Win!<br /><br />I was worried that I'd have unload the desk and and pull it out to install this basket- I didn't.  I just slid up each of the clamp/hangers sideways, turned each 90 degrees and tightened them and then hooked the basket to the hangers.  Done.<br /><br />Nice solution. Just make sure your desk has a rear ledge (i.e., doesn't have a flat vertical back).<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy installation<br />+ Holds firm<br />+ Holds a fair amount of weight (though seem 'con' below for wall-mount)<br />+ Includes rubber-like pads to be sure the clamps don't mar your desk<br />+ Well finished basket (no noticeable sharp wire edges)<br />+ Includes Velcro cable-ties which are useful<br />+ Includes adhesive cable holders (round things with a notch to hold cables) I don't use those.<br />+ Can even be wall mounted and includes both screws and drywall anchors but would be weight limited since it won't be able to hit both studs - see 'con' below.  (I didn't screw mine to the wall since they worked fine attaching to our desks).<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The wall-mount installation would likely not be able to take the same weight as the desk-attached installation.  The basket is 14.5"" with the clamp/hangers 1/2"" each inside of that 14.5"". Catching two studs with each end likely wouldn't work.  For US construction, making the baskets an 1"" to 2""  longer would help installation to wall studs for those who want to attach to a wall (I didn't wall mount so this wasn't a negative for me).<br /><br />Summary: A cable management isn't just for looks - it stops you from kicking wires as well so you don't accidentally turn things off.<br /><br />If your desk has a bunch of cords and outlet adapters below it, get one of these.

527132,3,Pencil Holder Opposite from the Charger,"I've been using the case for a week. It's sturdy enough, and doesn't add much bulk. The only issue I have with the case is the pencil holder and charging the pencil. Oddly enough, the pencil holder is on the opposite end of the device from the charger. You can place the pencil on the opposite end of the case (which is where the pencil charger is), and it charges fine, but you can't really carry it around like that unless you want to chance the pencil falling off.<br /><br />It never crossed my mind that charger was on the other end, not even when I was putting the case on the iPad... I figured it out when I tried to use my pencil, and the battery was dead.<br /><br />They may have had a reason, but UAG (https://www.amazon.com/Designed-Healthcare-Kickstand-Lightweight-Protective/dp/B0BFWXZPX3/ref=sr_1_6?crid=IM4WZD1XQ73W&keywords=Scout%2BSeries%2BiPad%2BMini%2B(6th%2BGen%2C%2B2022)%2Bwith%2BKickstand%2Band%2BHandstrap%2BCase&qid=1676401588&sprefix=scout%2Bseries%2Bipad%2Bmini%2B6th%2Bgen%2C%2B2022%2Bwith%2Bkickstand%2Band%2Bhandstrap%2Bcase%2Caps%2C119&sr=8-6&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.18ed3cb5-28d5-4975-8bc7-93deae8f9840&th=1) makes a case with similar capabilities, but it has built in stand, hand strap, and pencil holder. The UAG pencil holder is where it should be to allow charging of the pencil while stored. It is more expensive than this case by itself, but UAG has a built in hand strap and stand.

913618,5,Great Dash cam,"First thing I want to say is take some time and pre-sort everything before you get out to the car. It was a bit overwhelming at first when I dumped everything on my passenger seat. Once I was able to separate everything on my garage floor, setting it up was very simple.<br /><br />Install was as simple as plugging a few things in and running wires under the molding to hide them and keep them out of the way. This is powered by a USB-C cable which is supplied and is about 11.5 feet long. It plugs into a cigarette lighter USB adapter that is provided. I have a USB hub in my vehicle so I opted to plug it into that instead of the lighter port.<br /><br />The front facing camera quality is what you would expect for 1080P and is on par with the many other manufacturers out there. The cab camera and rear camera are actually only 720P, but that is more than enough for the purpose of it. The cameras do a pretty decent job of adjusting to light scenarios, although like most other dash cams on the market, the camera is pretty much blinded by headlights at night. But, at least if something happens at night, it will be enough to show the police so they can write in their report that you were not at fault, or maybe you were... But this will at least give the truth on what happened.<br /><br />I appreciate the ease of use when it comes to the buttons on the device itself.  Other dash cams I have used are all moving to touch screen which makes you navigate through 100 menus. The small screen supplied with this cam is perfect. I have an android deck that has a dash cam built into it with a 9"" screen, and never keep the dashcam on screen. The only reason for the screen on the dash cam I would have to say is to make sure it is capturing the area you need it to capture. If you need video, it is as simple as pulling the SD card and either handing it over to the police, (As long as you don't have you driving wild on it.) or pulling the card and pulling the video yourself from a computer.<br /><br />I did not run into any issues with this dash cam, and for a 3 channel dash cam under $100, this would be perfect for anyone looking for some extra protection, especially when doing ride sharing.<br /><br />The dash cam came with a 32GB SD card",[],B0BQMJB186,B0BQMJB186,AG5R5AOL6WRIOCN6V6BGQH3TVHFA,2023-03-06 05:48:40.910,0,False,510
449817,2,Mixed bag of meh,"First, the product does work. But there are several details that cause concern:<br />- It is really tight, and not as stretchable as other products like MusiCozy. To be fair - this is day one of my experience, so maybe that would change over time.<br />- Advise in the Q&A as well as the documentation in the box both say to remove the electronics and then it can be washed. Other than cutting into the thread stitches I don't see how this is possible. There are no flaps, buttons, zippers, or any other way to remove and reinsert the electronics without modifying the product.<br />- The instructions also have pictures that seem to look like other designs (controls on forehead), but what I received has the controls on the other side of the left ear. Maybe when the instructions say to remove the electronics for cleaning they are referring to a different model? I don't know, just not too happy when the instruction don't match the product.<br />- Playing my own audio sounds decent, definitely within expectations of a low price band. The voice prompts from the system are a garbled mess. It was hard to tell what it was saying the first time I turned it on (spoiler - I think it says ""Bluetooth mode"", which is intended to mean pairing.<br />- A common pitfall of electronics these days is not declaring device names. On top of that, someone above stated that the name was ""BT Hat"", while I found mine was ""BT Music"". Again, makes me think there are various models of these and not sure what we are getting.<br />- The instructions also state what the LEDs mean. The one I have does not have any lights that I can see, whether during charging, pairing or normal play.<br />- These would not be good for sleeping, at least not the model I got. The right side is passable, though it would hurt if that were between my ear and the pillow all night. The left side is both the speaker and the control housing. It is bulky enough that it was uncomfortable the instant it touched the pillow. Also, I while searching for a comfortable spot, the controls had enough pressure against the pillow to shoot the volume to max before i had a chance to get them off my head.<br />- I guess if I can't wash it without ripping it open, and can't sleep with it, I really don't have a use for this.",[],B0828QDT5J,B0BW4BBD7T,AG3RK23VRL22JAS5JUQDHWCBTEHQ,2023-04-17 20:27:23.225,0,True,510
851872,5,It Works Great,"I've worked on computers for years and if you know anything about computers they attract dust, food crumbs if you eat at your desk, and other debris you really do not want to think about. When cleaning desktops and laptops I would have to turn off the computers and use canned air to blast the dust away. If you know anything about canned air, it creates moisture and can get in there and damage your computers. So after you the compressed air I would have to let it sit for a few minutes to make sure the moisture is gone.<br /><br />Over the last few months, I've been seeing these little many electric dusters/vacuums and was curious as to how well they work.  When Amazon offered one up for review I just had to get one.<br /><br />The instructions are limited and it took me a couple of minutes to figure out how to set up the duster and the vacuum. Once I figured I had to charge it up. With USB-C fast charge it charges fast. I forgot to check to see how long it takes to charge. I've only had to charge it once it was on the charger at least 2 hours before I took it off and started using it.<br /><br />I was able to blow out 3 keyboards, fan grills on Alienware Laptop, and several vents on my external hard drives. I use the vacuum with the different attachments to get the dust stuck on my large mouse pad, fan grills, and other pc equipment.<br /><br />Since I do a lot of traveling and work from the car I tend to eat while on the move or in the parking lot as I do work. So crumbs get everywhere. I try and clean up the car but you can't get all the crumbs cleaned up after eating. So I have to drag out the shop vac and various detailing sprays/rags and do a deep cleaning several times a month.<br /><br />After all that it still has plenty of charge (I think).  It doesn't have an indicator that tells me how much charge is left.<br /><br />I tried out the vacuum with various attachments to reach into the tight spots in the center console, cup holders, and in between the seats. It works great.<br /><br />I found the suctions and blowing features to work fine. They could be a little stronger. But with its size, it really doesn't need it.",[],B0BLHF54M9,B0BLHF54M9,AF2PBMFTI7EBFMEFEPQEXZIKH5PQ,2023-01-20 05:57:45.891,1,False,510
414039,2,Not a full 360,"I was looking forward to this product because of the features of 360 degree view, being able to communicate through the app both ways, and it being able to plug into a light socket. I didn’t know exactly which socket I would spare but was willing to make the sacrifice of a prime light area if the camera worked well enough. Surprisingly, the camera came with an attachment that allowed this to be plugged into a wall rather than a light fixture! I loved that about it but came to realize it was not strong enough to support the weight of the camera, especially if it was moving at all, so it started to slowly fall out of the socket. That was strike one for me.<br />Strike two was trying to set up the camera (which, to be fair, was a pretty easy setup even though I think it asked for a bit too much information for this type of product), if I used the app to change the camera’s view, it would rotate the camera and would ultimately rotate the image on my screen to an off-kilter image. I guess I expected it to do automatic re-calibration and that is quite a bit to expect so it’s not necessarily the product’s fault for this issue.<br />Yet my third strike was the thing I was most excited for—360 degree views—not being possible (or at least not as far as I could figure out). One would think the app would be pretty straightforward where you press the up, down, left, and right buttons to direct your camera to those directions but they only went so far. I would say some of the angles I tried would not even go 180 degrees which was disheartening. I tried manually adjusting to see if I had just set up the camera location incorrectly but produced no better results. After troubleshooting for several more attempts, I ultimately recognized this system is not meant to work the way I expected and it was more hassle than it was worth for my purposes.<br />This could very well work for people who only have 1-2 views they want to see (and a feature I did like was that you could set “favorite” views) and if you’re fine tilting your head to the side to see the image in the right orientation.<br />I wasn’t impressed enough to test many of the other features but the talking back and forth seemed to work well. It just has a second or two delay before the audio reaches the other end.",[],B0BM3X3QYW,B0BVVYNB6Q,AEMJYC5OE5ZL54PXXLD3TLDP55UA,2023-03-01 01:29:00.561,1,False,510
745280,3,"Would have been GREAT, if it wasn't faulty.","I was going to use this mostly as a mood setting for those long summer nights on the beach, playing today's most popular love songs in a reggae version. However, this unit was so buggy or faulty that I wasn't able to cope with it. I almost decided to keep it just because it sounds so nice, and the bass was off the chain on it. Love the lighting features. However, I rather handle the issue now and face the issues in the future. I decided to not face the issue later and regret it.<br /><br />I ran into 2 issues with this unit.<br /><br />1st issue:<br />The power button will not turn off the unit. As soon as the unit powers off, it will auto power back on. I can't get this to power off at all. I went looking for answer on the internet and found out that there were many others who had the same issue. I tried the workaround, and the problem was you will need a power source to help turn off the unit. That's the reason I got it in the first place, so I don't have to have a power source, it's supposed to be portable.<br /><br />2nd issue:<br />This unit when turned on, the volume will turn down by itself right off the bat. As soon as you press play, the volume sounds great then the volume will just jump to 0(zero) and the volume will be turn off. No way around it, the only way to fix this issue was to press the volume button on the Partybox after your start your music, then press the volume up button then press play again. But if you turn the volume up on your phone, the volume gets all messed up again. It was very annoying; you will literally have to set your volume once and can't touch your volume button anymore.<br /><br />Overall - I think they should have made a power button to basically use as just that, to turn the unit off and the unit on. JBL made the power button the menu button, the selection button and you basically need to use the power button as a source to do other things. This can really put a strain on the power button that I'm afraid that the overuse of it will shorten its functionality in the years to come especially if you use the unit often. Awesome features, just too many bugs and or faulty things on a brand-new unit will not win me over.",[],B08HBG3M7M,B0B9X3WNVV,AEVZZWPYWRXLA44ZBC63U3KZ42LA,2023-01-18 01:02:44.499,5,True,510
822452,5,"Durable, sturdy, fits thick case, portable, and looks great.","I will go over some specifications of this tablet stand and then share my experience with it. In the box, I received the stand, a mini wrench, and a carry bag for the wrench. This stand is made of a very lightweight alloy. 4 non-slip rubber pads hold your tablet in place. 2 long pads on the back and 2 on the hooks that cradle your tablet. There are 2 little bumper pads on the bottom of the hinged legs to protect it while folded down. The dimensions of the top piece are Width 9 3/8"" x Height 7 1/4"" or 7 3/4"" from the top to the cradle arms. The legs are 5"" in length. The base dimensions are length 7 3/16"" × width 8 1/2"". You can fold the stand flat for storage or travel down to 1"" (1 3/8"" with cradle arms). You can fold it back or forth 180°. The back of the stand is open to allow airflow. I decided to get this tablet stand to make my tablet more like a laptop. I ordered a docking station I'm going to attach to this stand. I like the silver color because it matches the other stands I already own. I do have a smaller tablet stand that is nice but not as stable as this unit. The legs on this stand get tightened by the included mini wrench. You can tighten them up so they won't budge. You can draw or push on the screen with your finger and it is not going to fall or tip over. The wrench comes with a storage bag but I got a little magnet and stuck the wrench to one of the nuts so I always have it when I need it. My tablet is heavy and thick with my Unicorn Beetle case. Not only will the legs not budge but my tablet fits great on the cradle arms. It will easily hold my 10.5"" tab with the case and my 7"" tab with the case at the same time. I just ordered another stand like this but bigger for my laptop. The only thing I would have liked to see differently is nonslip pads underneath the base like my smaller units. Luckily I have a bunch of different types of foot pads because I'm a DIYer and always have little things like this. Nowhere in the description does it state it has pads on the bottom so this will not affect my review. It's still my favorite of all my stands. If you want a lightweight and very durable tablet stand give this a try.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710a6naK52L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710a6naK52L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710a6naK52L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BFsaG+0ZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BFsaG+0ZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BFsaG+0ZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71G0b1UhufL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71G0b1UhufL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71G0b1UhufL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LD7emJ3uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LD7emJ3uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LD7emJ3uL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MbejneGzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MbejneGzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MbejneGzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YA6Nk6KZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YA6Nk6KZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YA6Nk6KZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ghbzh8v5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ghbzh8v5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ghbzh8v5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wZ5dAZ9BL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wZ5dAZ9BL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wZ5dAZ9BL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yMe7Moo9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yMe7Moo9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yMe7Moo9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yz49PWdPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yz49PWdPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yz49PWdPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/812mEN5VCUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/812mEN5VCUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/812mEN5VCUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BPDTF16Z,B0BPDTF16Z,AHHMIUJFCH7M26C7AT7KOYSP4VLA,2023-02-27 22:18:15.179,0,False,510
104542,2,Wants to be a wired system...but it's not,"Through research and experience, I've come to the realization that wireless camera systems will never be adequate for anything except checking on your pets or kids.  As a security system, there's no way you're going to get video evidence of a (smart) burgler on your property.<br />This system, like most others, operates on 2.4GHz ONLY.  The reason is because the alternative (5GHz) won't go through walls and has a short range.  Problem is, 2.4GHz is what you're using to stream Netflix, play that new Taylor Swift single, and operate basically everything else in your smart home.  So if you were to stream 2K video 24/7 from a bunch of cameras, it will completely SATURATE your Wi-Fi network.  Also, it will run down the battery in about 4 hours and the solar panel won't keep up.  Manufacturers attempt to get around this by only transmitting and recording video when they sense motion.  Maybe other systems are better, but this system didn't start recording until the motion was halfway through the frame...and I was walking really slow.  When I ran through the frame, I was gone before it triggered.<br />Range is also an issue.  I had to be within 20 ft of the camera for it to pick me up, and that's on highest range and sensitivity.  Constant ""motion"" event recordings that turned out to be nothing were also an issue.<br />In addition to the poor performance, this brand is also poor quality. Cheap, plastic housings, and two of them I had to send back due to defects.  Communication and service with Wansview was very good though.<br />If you were reluctant before about running a new power circuit to all corners of your attic to install a wired system, bear in mind most wired systems nowadays are PoE so you don't have to run a power cord to each camera, just an ethernet cable.<br /> A wired system can record 24/7 in 4K resolution to a DVR or NVR and you never have to come home to find the place ransacked and worry about whether or not the camera system actually recorded it.  Granted, a wired system costs a little more, but consider one of these 5-camera systems will cost you $100 a year for useless storage of moths flying around.  Add that to the cost of a wired system instead, and you'll have everything recorded...everything.",[],B0B82N7GXD,B0B82N7GXD,AHPKPVAUFKKU4X6TYM26JP42ZMOQ,2023-03-01 23:55:39.971,2,True,510
663459,5,A genuine OFC cable made to the finest specs...  Only affordable,"The title says it all...  This is an amazing product made of the finest materials, and that includes oxygen free copper wiring.  This is a dual sheilded, OFC cable the likes of which is comparible to other well known brands among audiophiles, such as 'Cable Matters' and those other brands folks are out there paying $100 per cable for on a daily basis.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the fact that those Cable Matters cables are made of the best stuff, but I'm not paying that kind of money for a damn cable.  Even if I were wealthy, I would certainly find better ways to piss away good money, than to do so purchasing cables that run $100's of bucks a piece.<br /><br />However, at this price, I'm all in, and glad to be able to own such a product.  And I've already had a buddy compliment me on these cables just as much as he did my new Monolith M12 V2 powered subwoofer, and that's saying something, cuz my new subwoofer is BADASS, no 2 ways about it!  I am glad that I was able to find cables like this, so that I could get the best signal possible to my newest investment into my home theater though!<br /><br />And I HAVE actually tested this against my older Amazon Basics cables, and these definitely do provide a better signal to the sub that is noticeably stronger and more clean.  As a matter of fact, I have one sub that I had to use one 15ft splitter cable, coupled to one 15ft single LFE cable to connect to, where I used to use an Amazon Basics 30ft cable, and with the same aettings on the AVR, I could not use the Auto Mode on that sub, I would have to switch it to ON when watching in the room with that sub.  But with the same length cable, and same settings on the AVR, I can now use Auto Mode on the same sub, and it fuctions beautifully.<br /><br />If you are looking for quality subwoofer cables at a great price, don't bother continuing your search from here.  If you do, you'll only be short changing yourself if you pass this one up!

531715,5,Lots of outlets in a compact power-strip,"This is a sturdy and compact power-strip with a convenient 20 watt USB charger built-in.<br /><br />The unit is just under 10 inches long by 2 inches thick, once mounted to the bracket, the top sits just under 3 inches above the mounting surface.  There are ten 3-prong grounded power outlets and four USB jacks (3 Type A and one Type C). Five of the power outlets are located on the top of the unit with five additional power outlets on the front where the USB jacks are also located.<br /><br />The unit comes with a plastic base plate, which has an adhesive bottom for attaching to a desk surface. The power-strip is secured by sliding it onto the plate.  (I'm still experimenting with placement of this unit, so I can't yet speak to the holding power of the adhesive.)  There are also two key-slots on the back of the unit for mounting via screws if desired. No screws (or instructions of any kind) were included in the package I received.<br /><br />I like the six foot long flat cord, which has an angled 3-prong grounded plug.  I found the outlets on the power-strip to be a bit too close together.  If you are just plugging in power cords they are fine, however, they are too close together to accommodate even thin power supplies without giving up an outlet or two.  That being said, there are a total of ten outlets, which should cover most situations, especially considering the internal 20 watt USB charger.  Speaking of the charger, I tested it with a USB power analyzer. The USB outlets worked as expected, within acceptable tolerances under load.  The power strip also has an on/off switch and the listing states it has 1080J of surge protection.<br /><br />I find these types of power strips to be very helpful in reducing desktop clutter.  Having the addition of 4 USB power jacks really cuts down on the space required for power adapters, further reducing desktop clutter.<br /><br />I'm pleased with this power-strip, it has more than enough outlets to accommodate my needs and the addition of the built-in USB charger is a huge plus.  As far as value - at the time of this review, this was priced at $45, which puts it on the high-side of these types of devices, however, it seems well made and so far has performed flawlessly.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61BzAKzRAhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61BzAKzRAhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61BzAKzRAhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61P0oYtDW6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61P0oYtDW6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61P0oYtDW6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710zUMAQJHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710zUMAQJHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710zUMAQJHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71AsW0v8ZML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71AsW0v8ZML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71AsW0v8ZML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bVcb5zZfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bVcb5zZfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bVcb5zZfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71puoDViEcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71puoDViEcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71puoDViEcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xdB8dShAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xdB8dShAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xdB8dShAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71y42-uxvTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71y42-uxvTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71y42-uxvTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81iNqX2fWLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81iNqX2fWLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81iNqX2fWLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BQ724NP5,B0BTVYNCQ4,AHT6OSJAJ53COBWUJCLJAUFF4LIA,2023-02-07 22:19:19.584,0,False,510
640396,3,"Budget Android TV box; plays Prime Video only at 480p, max.","I'm comparing this to my current budget Tanix box - Android 9 with 4GB ram and 64GB rom. Picture quality on this Android 11 box is slightly better - fewer artifacts and less noise in picture. Both boxes can have a slight waxy quality to colors. However, this box lags in routine operations like accessing features of apps. If you click the mouse multiple times in succession, operation will stall up to a minute with fairly frequent reboots. So, click once and wait to see if it registered. Annoying.<br /><br />The deal-breaker for me is that this box plays Prime Video only at 480p maximum resolution. That's typical of most Chinese-branded Android TV boxes. The internet can't agree on why. Speculation includes that almost all of these boxes, including this one, have DRM settings of Widevine L3 (which forces the 480p limit though most other streaming services can play higher than 480p), not the L1 required for 1080p; or, that certification/licensing from Amazon is required; or, that Amazon has to to whitelist the box.<br /><br />My only other air mouse remote came with a Sony home theater receiver. I hated it. This one isn't half bad. It has multiple keys for most of the functions normally requiring menu access. I still can't get the hang of twisting my wrist to direct the mouse.<br /><br />To use he remote's voice command, you have to set Google Assistant as the default . You then press and hold the voice button to speak. Similar to using voice on the PlayStore or for search on Android, but with a physical button. Seems poorly integrated - you can open but not close apps. Not clear if you can actually control apps with voice.<br /><br />When I tried to use voice control of Prime Video, Android said I have to link that to Assistant in settings. BUT, while a number of apps are listed for linking, Prime Video isn't and there doesn't seem to be any way to add it. Not interested in giving Google my login, anyhow. Might investigate further, or maybe contact the vendor later.<br /><br />Only tried Prime Video and Youtube (which looks fine). Personally, this unit isn't really an upgrade from my Tanix or other older budget boxes, unless you want Android 11, an air mouse with voice, or the ability to use Google Assistant (assuming that you can actually control apps with voice).",[],B09XMDR7MR,B09XMDR7MR,AHJS3YSQMFH56VD3RG6DEZYUOKLQ,2023-01-10 12:31:35.656,0,False,510
240795,1,Caution -- not what it seems,"The Canon Selphy 1500 printer has great reviews in the trade press and by purchasers.  Unfortunately it has two serious technical defects that reviewers have ignored, and which made it unusable for me.<br /><br />First, it advertises ""matte"" printing of photos in addition to the standard ""glossy"" finish.  It is NOT a matte finish, but rather a diamond-shaped grid that overlays the glossy print to ""fake"" a matte finish.  The effect is nothing like a matte finish.  The description that it can print matte is false and misleading.<br /><br />The second, and for me more serious, technical issue is that it requires a direct wifi connection between iPhone and the printer in order to print to the printer from an iPhone.  This means that you must change the iPhone wifi setting from your normally connected wifi network to the ""private direct wifi network"" where the printer becomes the wifi server.  In the process, you no longer have a web-connected iPhone, only the ""Direct Connection"" to the printer.  On top of that, when you set the printer to Direct Connection wifi, the Canon Selphy printer cannot be ""seen"" nor can it be used by any other devices (computers, laptops, tablets, etc.) because it has been disconnected from the existing WiFi network (oh, of course, unless you cut off all web connection by connecting those devices to just the Canon printer!!).  Canon might have designed the printer to support both the Direct Connection wifi and concurrently support the existing home WiFi network, but that would only be a band-aid on the problem.  The right way would be to build the Canon Selphy app to allow the iPhone to continue its normal home (or office) WiFi network connection and allow printing to the Selphy through that connection.  There is another problem with the DirectConnect configuration -- it can only print within the closer range of the Selphy's wifi signal, and cannot use the broader distance that the home or office WiFi network supports.<br /><br />I gave up on this printer, and bought a ""normal"" Epson photo printer that prints ""real"" matte prints, and also understands that it properly lives in the existing WiFi network, and doesn't need to make up a local WiFi network of its own.  The experience with the Canon Selphy technical design issues has been very frustrating.  Canon should be able to excel in technical performance -- here it failed in basic design.",[],B0BF65S5J5,B0C7HT6VZS,AFVANSG5RXDFZQDFU5W5AJ3XBM6Q,2023-04-08 18:18:07.053,6,True,510
277445,3,"Great product, great reports great features but freaking huge!!!!","this is a cautionary tale in case you're looking to get the GPS device with 140 day charge. I have a spark nano with the weather resistant case.  That device is excellent but it only has a 2-week battery life.  I love the brickhouse monitoring app. it's very easy to understand comparative to other monitoring apps, and the reporting function is great. One of the things I love is you can see a location history in normal English and see exactly the time and the location of whatever you're tracking.  I liked it so much, I wanted to upgrade to a device with a longer battery life so I opted for the extended battery device.  it boasted of 140 days holding a charge, based on your monitoring/refesh options.  so I ordered the device and noticed it was freaking huge.  The battery pack that came with it was like a bank of 8 AA batteries.  then the magnetic case that surrounded everything made it look like 3/4 of a brick.  Yes,  I'm talking about a masonry brick that you see in buildings.  I figured what the heck let me try it out anyway. so I charged it up and slapped it on the vehicle, and don't you know,  my kid, who was driving the car, noticed it PDQ.  My car is a 2007 Jetta and my kid drives that car. Jettas, at least the car that I have, has a barrier between the road and the mechanical parts so you can't easily find a place to stick the magnetic device.  I had to pull that barrier away from the underside of the car in order to find some kind of metal to stick the device to.  okay, i got the damn thing positioned, put everything back nice and neat, and my kid takes the vehicle out.  well he goes over a low freaking speed bump or something and pulls the barrier away from the vehicle  - my kid,  being a considerate kid - noticed it and got down on his hands and knees and tried to put the barrier back in place and lo and behold he found the tracking device.  needless to say a very lengthy conversation ensued.  so if you've got a place to put something the size of 3/4 of a brick on the undercarriage of your vehicle, go for it.  I like the app, I like to device, customer service was wonderful, but I wouldn't recommend it if you have a vehicle that's low to the ground .",[],B07R3TBVKG,B07R3TBVKG,AHN2Q24CNE373HXQVL2SANGYAFZA,2023-03-22 23:29:33.647,1,True,510
190861,3,Might work for you depending on your use case...,"Build quality and overall score as a backpack is a decent 6 or 7. It feels like a quality item but not mind-blowing. Fairly priced. Comfortable, rides well despite not much adjustability, zippers work well enough, etc. The camera area, on the other hand, is outstanding. I own and love the Tenba BYOB 10. The camera compartment of the Fulton is just as good if not better than the BYOB. Bigger than the BYOB 10, really well padded, and they give you a ton of dividers to play with. It's also deeper than the BYOB by about an inch.<br /><br />I also like that the laptop goes in front - it always makes me nervous having a laptop pressing against my back.<br /><br />But there are problems. First of all - the roll-top area. I love the idea of a roll-top that can expand to fit the moment. The problem is, the sliding buckle and strap totally suck. An ordinary plastic buckle or even velcro would have been so much better here. What should be a quick-access area ends up being slow and frustrating.<br /><br />The water bottle pocket material feels super fragile. Like it'll rip or snag if you look at it too hard.<br /><br />Also, outside of the camera compartment, there's basically zero organization. Two small slip pockets in front of the laptop and that's it. They could have easily added another zippered pocket to that area, or a pocket or two inside the roll-top.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this pack is that if you're not maxing out the camera area with camera gear, then you're left with awkward space that's probably not much use. And if you ever need to press it into service as a completely non-camera bag, you've got to remove all the individual dividers and store them...somewhere...<br /><br />The flexibility is there - you can move all the dividers and, for example, cut the gear area in half and turn that into empty cargo space instead, but not easily. And when you do, it just highlights even moreso the lack of organization throughout the rest of the bag.<br /><br />So your needs may vary, but me personally, I don't need that much camera kit on my back at all times. If you do, this bag could do the trick for you.",[],B09KM5X8Z9,B0BL16LVJK,AEWTX3HHKPIEGCWFP4JDVDD4O45Q,2023-02-03 19:44:42.200,0,True,510
702396,4,Good picture quality but short on features,"[[VIDEOID:c69a7722db0717a720340b1d6290d0a8]] Almost any projector looks good in a dark room on a purpose made screen, so to get a real indication of its brightness and picture quality, I deliberately tested this device in a bright room with a window exposed to full midday sun, while projecting onto a light green wall (see video). To be honest, I was very pleased and somewhat surprised by its performance.<br /><br />Picture quality is very good and it supports a variety of common video and image file formats without having to connect it to a video player. This might make it a good choice for businesses users who need a simple portable projector that can display videos and images on the go.<br /><br />The controls on the projector are easy to use and straightforward. Likewise, the included wireless remote provides good functionality. Projection quality is surprisingly good for a unit of this size. The picture is bright and even small text is legible. One thing to note is that the keystone feature will cause parts of the screen to go out of focus at its maximum setting.<br /><br />There is an included drawstring bag that's big enough to carry the projector but it doesn’t really provide any protection, so you may want to keep it in a padded case if you plan to travel with it. There is a tripod mount on the bottom of the projector which you can use to permanently mount the it to a ceiling or cabinet. Also, there is a convenient menu setting that allows you to flip the picture if you need to mount the projector upside down. A folding tripod is included but it isn’t adjustable so it doesn't seem very useful to me.<br /><br />Although this is advertised as a mobile device compatible projector, connecting it to an iPhone or Android device requires a separate wired or wireless adapter which is not included. Standard VGA, composite video, and HDMI ports are provided as well as USB and microSD ports. Unfortunately, there is no Bluetooth connectivity as you might find on similar products in the same price range.<br /><br />This is a pretty decent little projector that’s very bright for its size, and it also happens to be very light and portable. I think there are products with better features at the same price point, but I would still recommend this projector as the picture quality and brightness are surprisingly good. Just be aware of the limitations of the device.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+KYBpphHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+KYBpphHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+KYBpphHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7150TVOR17L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7150TVOR17L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7150TVOR17L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Cyl7OT76L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Cyl7OT76L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Cyl7OT76L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71S103H9CfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71S103H9CfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71S103H9CfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81bjigU3RhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81bjigU3RhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81bjigU3RhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BQD6MHYG,B0C5CZWK93,AHOAHLDWEXOF7OR5AP5JOLNA22QA,2023-03-16 20:56:02.814,0,False,510

We got an almost 1/4 mile long driveway, and it does pick up from that far away, even from within the house.!<br />-Love that you don't need to run it through your home router or use WIFI. This really opens up the usability option.<br />-Come already paired, so you don't need to fiddle around with that.<br />-You can cover up to 4 separate zone areas with this unit by adding 3 more sensors to this unit. So, you can have one in the front of the house, one in the back, and one on each side.  Although I don't know where to buy those extra sensors. I guess they will be coming out with them soon.<br />-Each sensor has its own unique alarm sound so you know which zone area is showing the movement.<br />-Super easy install hang. Hook back so you can move it around easily.<br />-Looks like an inconspicuous birdhouse!<br />-Good volume, nice and loud, or turn it down.<br /><br />But, a couple of issues.<br />-You get 4 alarm sounds, one for each zone, and most of them are obnoxious! It comes preset to the ""polka music"" zone. We changed it to the doorbell zone; But, if we ever want to expand this and make use of all four zones, the polka alarm will have to be used.  It would have been nice to have a little library of sounds to pick from.<br />-Ours has been inconsistent. Sometimes it recognizes movement and goes off, and sometimes it doesn't. We are still playing around with it. So, we might have met the end of the range by installing it at the end of our driveway, and so that might be causing a problem. Also, we have only it up for a couple of days and had cloudy days only. We didn't pre-charge it, so that might be the reason for the inconsistency.

414825,4,"Complete set, minus instructions, comfortable","[[VIDEOID:92ad1ad4ebbbd969e9158a49097bb057]] I love my Fitbit Inspire2, but sometimes the watch band clashes badly with what I'm wearing.  This set gives you options to go with pretty much anything, color wise.  It is a very casual set, so it may not be appropriate for every setting (ie, formal occasions), but you certainly will be able to match your watch band to your outfit.<br />There is a packet with the fasteners for each watch band, 4 packets total.  Each packet contains 3 fasteners, so you have an extra for the inevitable drop and lose situation.  There are no instructions for how to attach the fasteners, but I was able to easily figure it out by pulling off my current watchband and looking at how it works.  The fasteners just slide into the plastic end, and there is a slot to push the protruding pin into so it stays in place.  Then you just put one end into the watch opening, push back the pin and push the other side into place, then let go of the pin.  Now, the first side was easy, but the second side is a bit trickier because the band is a loop, and it keeps getting in the way of your work.  But with a little patience, it's doable.<br />The band itself is elastic, with a sliding adjustment.  It's pretty much impossible to adjust while on your wrist, so it takes a few times of putting on and taking off to adjust according to your preference.  The band is comfortable, not too tight as I adjusted it, so it stays in place.  It is a canvas type material, so again, not very dressy looking, but will do for everyday wear.  I think it will work well for exercise, keeping the wrist from getting too sweaty, and keeping the watch in place properly without having to tighten it too much.<br />I took off one star because I think the watchband would be better if there were a clasp rather than strictly elastic with an adjustment loop.  That would make it a lot simpler to attach.  And also the one star off because of lack of instructions.  Everything should come with at least basic instructions, in my opinion, even if pictures only.  Otherwise, I think the bands are well constructed, should last well, and be comfortable.

762442,4,Nice Digital Magnifier,"As the title indicates, I would label this device as a digital magnifier.<br />A microscope is defined as a piece of scientific equipment that lets us see very small things that our eyes otherwise couldn't see.<br />There is quite a difference between a magnifier that lest you see p.e coins or insects in great detail and a microscope that lets you see clearly p.e bacteria, amebae, algae.<br />To give an idea, at 400x magnification you will be able to see bacteria, blood cells and protozoans swimming around. At 1000x magnification you should be able to see these same items, but you will be able to see them even closer up. The claim that this device can magnifies up to 1000x to me seems a little far fetched. I think a more realistic magnification would be between 50x and 200x, that is without distortions of an excessive use of the digital zoom.<br /><br />But, lets get back to this product. It is nicely built in aluminum. It comes with a handy weighted base were you attach the magnifier and permits to position correctly with your subject.<br />The DM1S connects through WiFi (not Bluetooth) to the previously downloaded Uni Lab App in your phone. It will appear with a WiFi SSID as WTM-W1... Upon connecting, you will loose your internet connection. The connection process can be buggy sometimes when initiating the ""start to observe"" button, I had to restart the process sometimes for it was not functioning correctly.<br /><br />The rechargeable battery of the DM1S charges in about 2 hours using the enclosed USB-C cable and will last for 1,5 hours of use. You can also use this device while connected directly to your computer through the USB cable, it should detect automatically (windows 11) as a camera/scanner device and install its drivers.<br />You can snap photos  of your observations with the camera button, although sometimes it would save the images as PNG instead of JPG in the album. On the side of the DM1S you have a three setting light brightness / darkness buttons, very handy. There is also a kind of hidden RESET hole between the buttons, just insert a paper clip to restore to factory.<br />In conclusion, this is a fun product that you will enjoy making observation of small things, much better than a magnifying glass but don't expect to see micron sized subjects as in a real scientific microscope.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ifwmqZEQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ifwmqZEQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ifwmqZEQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CTbi2OxaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CTbi2OxaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CTbi2OxaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61auY9HcraL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61auY9HcraL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61auY9HcraL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61k1s30jDfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61k1s30jDfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61k1s30jDfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ynS8MbaLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ynS8MbaLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ynS8MbaLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71AiThKiGZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71AiThKiGZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71AiThKiGZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RS5gd2aNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RS5gd2aNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RS5gd2aNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BHQYQMQ9,B0C5C2WDB8,AEGZEGTR72327NMEGOP3D37WPTLQ,2023-01-20 00:40:09.954,3,False,510

485581,3,"Nice light, surprisingly good radio, crank, solar and USB charge port aren't useful","[[VIDEOID:81748aa6d2b7a832e268e042865fc1a]] This is a nice emergency radio.  It does all the things you'd expect - with a few extras that don't really work.<br /><br />The one thing I was impressed with - the audio quality is quite good, and the reception is quite good too.  NOAA Weather Radio came in loud and clear even with the antenna down, and I was even able to receive AM stations, which is generally a problem due to all the electronic gadgets around.  The antenna is quite hard to get out, I had to find a business card or similar to slip behind it.  It's too smooth to grab with my fingernails.  It might work if you have long nails, though.<br /><br />The flashlight is fine - has 3 power settings to help conserve charge, and it has useful larger light behind the solar panel.  Both are quite bright.<br /><br />The USB power output is a joke. Rated for 1A @ 5v, but can't even do that small amount.  It cuts off at around 600ma, not enough to charge anything. Your phone probably uses 600ma, and most chargers are at least 2000ma.<br /><br />It comes with a solar panel and crank for charging.  Don't be fooled by them, they're really not as useful as you'd think.  When you look at the specs on the listing - it takes a whopping *9 hours* to charge the unit via the hand crank.  That means you'd have to sit there and run the crank for 9 hours to get a full charge.  But you can probably crank on it for 15 to 30 minutes and get a little useful light and check the radio.  I seriously doubt the crank would withstand 9 hours of continuous cranking.<br /><br />The solar panel is even worse - they state it takes 100 hours to charge via the solar panel.  If you have 10 good hours of sunlight a day, that's a whopping *10 days* to get it charged up.  Again, you might get enough for a useful amount of light and radio by letting it charge during the day, but don't expect a ton of charge via the solar panel.<br /><br />Overall the radio is good, the light is good.

999205,5,Inexpensive entry-level security that’s easy to set up,"I didn’t have high expectations for this camera originally, but I’m happy to report that it’s a good deal if you’re in the market for a quick and easy system for watching your door. What I needed was something to watch for movement at my front door and alert me, maybe take a picture and send it to me wherever I am.<br /><br />What I got exceeded my expectations! The camera comes with an app you can download onto your phone and tablet. This app is amazingly easy to set up, and once the cameras are connected, it works without needing any further tweaking. Setting up and mounting the cameras is also easy, the app walks you through each step with video tutorials to help you out.<br /><br />Once set up, the camera activates on movement and you can set it to send you an alert plus a video of the movement. We found one of our neighbor’s dogs had gotten out and was on our porch wanting help, so this camera already paid for itself in social capital alone! Another bonus is the ability to talk with people outside without opening the door - very helpful if you don’t know the person and aren’t comfortable opening the door to strangers.<br /><br />Overall, I’m very happy with this security camera. Best advice I can give is this:<br />1. When the camera arrives, go ahead and give it a full charge, regardless of the solar panel. While it’s charging, download the app and get ready to configure the camera. The app is incredibly helpful, they’ve done a great job with the setup process, tutorials, and user interface.<br />2. Configure it to your network before going to where you want to mount it so the setup is fully complete with good wi-if connectivity. Then go check the signal where you want to place it.<br />3. Put a micro-so card in and format it once the setup is complete. Then mount the camera where you want it. You can use the app to see what the camera will see so you can position it for maximum effectiveness.<br />4. The solar panels really are optional, the battery is long-lasting enough that you could just let it work off the battery and just bring it in once a quarter for a full recharge, as long as you don’t have it placed in a high-traffic location with lots of alerts.",[],B0B6J8DNDY,B0BVYN6JNT,AEUSX2B2PMDZK3QLF2YWTNKN45TA,2023-02-27 17:30:51.844,18,True,510
149376,5,Good quality turntable and speakers for low price,"The turntable and speakers came well packaged and included 45-rpm adapter, about 3 foot long speaker wires, RCA cables, 12VDC 2A power supply and a manual. The manual was brief, but there was sufficient information to set up the system. The manual only said to adjust the counter weight for 3 gram +/- 0.5. But it didn't mention how to set it to zero first. I had to undo the set screw in the counter weight slightly in order to adjust it. I adjusted it until the tonearm was balanced, then set the dial to zero. I then adjusted the counter weight to 2.5 g, 3 g sounds high to me. There was no instruction for the skating control - I left it at the set position.<br />The finish on both the speakers and the turntable is imitated walnut. But especially on the turntable it looks good. The turntable has feet that dampens vibrations. The cloth fronts of the speakers are easily removable.<br />The Amazon description indicates that a speed of 78 rpm is available, but there are only two fixed speeds 33 and 45 rpm. I'm only using 33 rpm. The nice features of this turntable are the AT-3600L moving magnet cartridge, the belt driven full size platter and adjustable counter weight.<br />There is a power switch on the back and then you can select between Bluetooth and the turn table by pushing the mode button.  Blue for Bluetooth and red for turntable. The light will flash blue to synchronize with another Bluetooth device. I used my phone and it got connected immediately. The sound quality was good but since the speakers are relatively small you don't get a really deep bass. But the sound is well balanced and not over emphasized at the low end.<br />Using the turntable with a few different LP records I found that the sound was very good considering the cost of the system. It is loud enough for most normal sized rooms. The motor is quiet.<br />There are no tone controls, like treble and bass, only volume. But I found the balance to be good. You do have to lift the cover in order to adjust the volume.<br />I tested the RCA outputs by connecting to another amplifier and speakers and it worked well.. The output level is fixed, independent of the volume control, like it should be.<br />There are no specifications for amplifier power output, distortion, frequency response, etc.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YE48dJ7XL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YE48dJ7XL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YE48dJ7XL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BQD8CTT4,B0C9JJ41QP,AGM76UENLOTVWRBL4TAEI76CN5AQ,2023-02-24 02:50:53.218,0,False,509
968383,5,Fantastic Large Travel Backpack,"I occasionally travel by air for work purposes and when I do I struggle to get all the things I need into one modest sized checked bag and one carry on backpack. I ran across this and ordered it for future trips.<br /><br />This backpack is much larger than your typical around town/school bag, maybe twice as large. It is like combining a small suitcase, a school backpack, and a hiking pack, with the best features of all. It is taller, wider, and deeper, especially when the expander zipper is undone. I’m not sure how much foot room will be left if you put it under an airline seat, but it should fit fine in overhead bins.<br /><br />The main compartment will easily hold any size laptop, power brick, mouse, a writing tablet, and still leave plenty of room for a couple changes of clothes. The straps inside will help ensure the contents don’t move around much in travel. This main compart opens in a side fashion, like a suitcase, so you might not want to put anything in that part that you’d want easy access to in the airport or on a plane.<br /><br />There are a number of medium and small pockets incorporated in this, to include one against your back that would be a good size to hold some items that you really don’t want to get pilfered such as IDs, boarding passes, etc. These all open on the top with zippers so would be better places to store items you’d like to access in transit.<br /><br />All the zippers work very smoothly. The shoulder straps are padded so they should be comfortable and there is a chest strap between the two straps to keep them from sliding off your shoulders. There is a strap next to your back that can be put over the handle of a rolling suitcase so you can take the backpack off while you’re waiting in the never-ending line at the airline counter.<br /><br />The weight is a happy balance, lighter than a suitcase, but heavy enough construction that it shouldn’t fall apart under normal use.<br /><br />The only slight negative is that it has a strong odor right out of the package. I’m sure this will abate over a short amount of time, but I wouldn’t recommend ordering it to use for a last-minute trip; rather give it at least a week or two before using.",[],B0BLNBM2TL,B0BS8NSZ3Z,AF6NNBQSYQSC3S332UUMEJ7IKUYA,2023-01-13 19:41:33.077,0,False,509
327045,4,Can't beat the price! But some caveats...,"I'm using this triple monitor stand to replace a Mount-Up Gas adjustable mount I was using for the last 2 years.<br /><br />I bought this for the single wide arm that didn't offer any articulation of the individual monitors save for slight angle adjustments, and THERE ARE TONS OF FINE-TUNING adjustments with this mount!<br /><br />Trying to align my monitors before was a nightmare! Everything was always just that little bit off. When I decided to buy all new 27"" Dark Matter monitors to match up, I didn't want to leave it to chance. I took a gamble with this Joy Seeker desk Mount and I got a bit win!.<br /><br />There are some caveats however...<br /><br />The loss of a star...<br />-For me, installation was a bit unintuitive. Trying to handle a monitor (even a lighter 11lb one) was rather difficult when the arms and main post was already setup (Per instructions) Instead I took it all apart and mounted each monitor to their respective positions. Which helped me identify some spacing issues preventing the included mount hardware from tightening (should be snug, but don't force it! That could ruin your monitor) So invest in some #8/#10 washers from the Home Depot, a box of ~100 costs like 3 bucks. I needed 3-4 to snug up the screws and ensure my monitors were snug and mounted. Then attached the arms after centering and setting height on the center mount/monitor.<br />-Do yourself a favor, and wiring it up next, strapping any wiring to the center post BEFORE you attempt any alignment.<br /><br />This is where I came across the only other gripe about this mount. It has tuning for everything...and I mean EVERYTHING! even that slight 1mm off height for the side monitors, easy twist of a knob!<br /><br />BUT, the side to side pivot, has NO WAY to tighten. I took off the plastic housing, but the Hex bolts were tucked behind metal plates and has zero chance to ever tighten. After tuning, I should have to budge it much, but time will tell if these cause issue. So far though, I am happy with the end result.<br /><br />I high recommend, even with the caveats as they may be minor to some, but the super clean and lined up triple monitor setup is my favorite thing!",[],B09LTQHPJS,B09LTQHPJS,AEMVHVH423RGU47FK5YIKZHKISSQ,2023-03-07 19:09:12.105,0,True,509
725746,3,Great first run,"I have been waiting for a product like this for a while. There are a couple other brands on the market to write with the electronic ink but being able to also have access to the Amazon library is pretty awesome. There are some noticeable flaws to it however.<br />Most notably is that the touch screen has some dead zones as well as certain areas it isn't super precise. The right top and bottom corners do not work with the pen so if you are writing and then get to those spots nothing shows up which is annoying. There are also certain zones less specific where when you are writing where the pen is and where the ink/writing shows up is does not match very well so it gets a bit sloppy looking. This is annoying for my needs which is mostly writing text and drawing chemical structures, but I imagine it would get increasingly annoying if you were drawing and couldn't get the details you want.<br />Eventually it would be awesome if you could directly add files to your Kindle Scribe by a USB C cable instead of having to upload to Amazon's website and then send them over, which many commenters have noted could be a security/privacy issue.<br />Ultimately I would also like it if they could get the device compatible with Microsoft Office so you could look at and edit PowerPoints and Word documents, like competitors are able to do.<br />I have heard that some of these fixes are on the way, but until it happens I won't hold my breath.<br />If there were additional pen tips or settings to increase the precision of the pen this would be a no brainer purchase. As is there is a little to be desired when it comes to the level of detail in the writing/drawing you can do.<br /><br />Although that all may seem a bit negative I do like this product and am happy with the purchase. I have wanted a large Kindle like this to read and mark up PDFs for years and this does the job really well. The battery life is fantastic even with extensive use and I am excited to see how this product gets improved upon in the future.<br /><br />I moved it down from four to three stars after using it extensively for a couple more weeks.

32217,4,Specialty Product,"Let me start by noting that bone-conducting headphones are a specialty product. The purpose of bone-conducting headphones is to give you acceptable audio quality while also allowing you to hear what is happening around you. As such, they are a compromise. The sound quality of bone-conducting headphones lacks classic headphones' dynamic range and precision. For example, they need to produce better bass tones. Also, all of the tones they can deliver are muddy. So, bone-conducting headphones are for something other than listening to high-quality music.<br /><br /> So, what are bone-conducting headphones for? Well, I use them while teaching classes online. That allows me to hear what the student online are saying, and I can quickly switch to taking a phone call. Given that I can use them and still hear what is going on around me during classes, there are great for this. You may have your use for them.<br /><br />So, with bone-conducting headphones, what should you look for? A lot of the things you want in more mainstream headphones are the same in bone-conducting headphones, including comfort, Bluetooth connection stability, and battery life.<br /><br />So, how do the Bigozones deliver? They are a bit small, so they are not especially comfortable. However, they are not uncomfortable. However, this is subjective. The Bigozones claim to support Bluetooth 5.3, the latest Bluetooth standard. This means that once you make a Bluetooth connection, the Bigozones have the connection locked. Many expensive Bluetooth suffer from stability problems, with periodic disconnects and such. I have yet to experience a disconnect with the Bigozones. Bluetooth 5.3 also means that the Bigozones support connection to two devices at the same time. So, for me, it is a smooth transition between my computer and my phone and back again. This is a real strength for the Bigozones. I also get a bit over 5-hours of continuous battery life from the Bigozones. Given how small and light these headphones are, that is a good use time out of their tiny batteries.<br /><br />For special use in which, you need headphones and need to hear what is going on around you. The Bigozones are a good candidate for your consideration. They could be more comfortable, and the battery life could be improved. But as they are, I would get another pair if they needed replacement.",[],B0BLRNDDLP,B0BLRNDDLP,AGZ75YPRRS3C7UZP32XVQQT7RVYQ,2023-01-15 19:12:02.846,0,False,509

Very easy set up and connection to a video/internet stick. I used ONN, a cheap app stick connected via HDMI. You can basically connect anything to this via HDMI and it should project whatever you have connected, like a Firestick or a Google Chromecast disk, or even a laptop.<br /><br />I connected my phone as well and can play videos from the phone or YouTube, or basically anything that's displayed on your phone will be projected, you just need an HDMI to lightning cable for iPhones or HDMI to android cable for Androids.<br /><br />The sound from the projector is just ok, at least it has one, and it'll do if you don't have an external speaker. Which you can connect if you can connect it with an audio jack cable. It's good if you're in a quiet room, but if you go outside and you turn the volume way up, it can get a little crackly and sound like it's coming from a can. No bluetooth so you can not connect a bluetooth speaker.<br /><br />It has an easy manual focus and basic controls. On my video review you can see a decent picture, despite me projecting on a rough and dirty white wall. I'm pretty sure that if I had a clean white and smooth projector screen that the picture will be much better. I also think that for this to have the very best picture you want to be in a very dark environment or better yet somewhere in complete darkness.<br /><br />It's pretty small and light, very portable, but with that said, keep in mind you also have to have all the cables that are required to connect it to power, the cable for the device you are playing the video on and/or an external speaker if you want the best sound. You will also need something to put it on in order to face it correctly, and ideally, level to the screen or wherever you are projecting on.<br /><br />That's where the tripod hole on the bottom comes in handy, so if you'll be using that you'll need a standard tripod(or mini tripod) to carry around. You might also need a projector screen if you don't have a smooth white wall. Just things to keep in mind.

I could not use the app, and thereby the printer, without granting location access to the Canon app, and I tried every which way to do it, but could not proceed.  In the interest of giving a good review, I went ahead and allowed access, and then the display problems started, and it wouldn't connect to the printer.

The building of a picture is easy enough, you pick from a variety of formats like side-by-side, top-and-bottom, and so forth, and then you click on the pane you wish to populate, and it brings up your device gallery.  I didn't have many pictures on this tablet, so that's the reason for the eclectic mix of images I used.  The print quality is VERY good.  Much better than I expected.

616461,3,"Versatile 36 W power supply - cheaply made, not very rugged","I like the idea of having 10 different tips to adapt this power supply to different applications. I especially liked the terminal strip output tip as an option, and it made testing with my electronic load very easy. Unfortunately, I don't think the power supply is very well designed overall.<br /><br />One thing to note up front: the prongs that plug into the outlet are too thin. They measure about 1.1 mm in thickness; others I checked were more like 2 mm. This means that the supply is prone to falling out of the outlet. Take off 1 star for that.<br /><br />See the graph I uploaded showing the voltage v. output current of this power supply. It will do 3 A (though the voltage has dropped to 11.5 V using the screw terminal output connector).<br /><br />I'm not rating this as severely as I might, considering that the product essentially broke while I was testing it, because I did abuse it. However, I think a power supply should be designed to stand any overload, or short circuit, indefinitely.<br /><br />As I was testing, I noticed the output connector was getting quite hot. It eventually must have melted and fused the terminal strip tip to the barrel connector. The output no longer worked. I'm not sure exactly what happened, but the connector/tip combination had gone open apparently, and there was not output voltage.<br /><br />However, the supply itself was not damaged; I was able to cut the connector off and connect to bare wires (see photo).<br /><br />I then re-tested the power supply without the connector system. Under load, I observed significantly higher voltage.<br />3 A - with connector: 11.45 V<br />3 A - no connector, bare wires: 12.15 V<br /><br />0.113 Ohms without the connector<br />0.35 Ohms with the connector<br /><br />3 A using the terminal strip connector would dissipate about 2 W right in the connector, and the overall voltage drop is quite significant (about 0.7 V).<br /><br />So the real problem here is apparently that the output connector is not designed to handle 3 A, even though the power supply can produce that much output current.<br /><br />I would not recommend using this power supply if you really need 3 A. It might be ok for a less demanding application.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/512752yY-2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/512752yY-2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/512752yY-2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611izVrX8HL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611izVrX8HL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611izVrX8HL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qcnrAiscL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qcnrAiscL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qcnrAiscL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BMQ165GR,B0BMQ165GR,AGZBEBGRYEHRGSY3EKYLYDJBS77A,2023-03-27 20:14:55.370,0,False,509
258774,5,Good solid blast of air!,"After years of using canned, compressed “air”, I decided it was time to go a more eco-friendly route. This compressed air duster packs a lot of oomph in a reasonably small footprint. At first, I was concerned that it wasn’t very strong, but then I realized there are three speeds. At the highest speed, this chases out the dust bunnies pretty well. The included additional tips are of varying usefulness, as my needs are limited to blowing dust out of keyboards and off of vent ports on computer cases. That said, two of the tips seem designed to be used for inflatables, so there might be more overall utility to this duster than I initially thought.<br /><br />I will say that if you’re after the pinpoint effect of canned air, this unit doesn’t quite match it even at the highest speed. It’s close, like 93% close, but not quite 100%. It seems to be a compromise between fan power (not speed) and nozzle width, because when I put on the concentrating tip then the airflow seems slightly restricted… ie, making the aperture smaller would result in less efficiency because the fan itself can’t push quite hard enough to move all the air volume through. Presumably, a more powerful fan would deplete the battery faster and would result in a higher cost for a more powerful motor, two factors that aren’t exactly desirable from a manufacturing standpoint. That said, for the retail price of this unit, I expected a little bit more. And that’s not necessarily more in terms of fan power… even the added thoughtfulness of including some sort of case to hold the duster and the tips and charger cord would have been appreciated, as the cardboard box isn’t going to last forever. That seems like a bigger deal to me in terms of the “big picture” perspective.<br /><br />Even still, the performance from this duster means that it will be a long time before I need to but any more canned air, and for that I am thankful. The battery still hasn’t run out after a bunch of use in the past couple days, so that seems like a good sign. I’d take off a half of a star for these reasons, but in a world of whole stars it rounds up to five. All around, I’m pleased with this unit and the convenience it offers.",[],B0BPRRYH97,B0BPRRYH97,AENUN5DC33QG5ZN56VTDWIBHM2IQ,2023-02-16 05:30:30.782,0,False,509
582278,1,Bose Are Lying Rats Trying To Sell Your Location To Advertisers,"The noise cancellation works fine, but I absolutely cannot believe that anyone recommends these things after trying to get them set up.<br /><br />If you want to use the headphones with the active noise cancellation you're paying $300 for, you have to connect it to a garbage app that lies to your face the second you enable it. These things are the product of the encrapification of everything we use, and one of the worst offenders of further encrapification of things in my life.<br /><br />Right out the bat, laughably short included cables (hope you're not over 5ft tall if you want to use the included 3.5mm cable with something in your pocket), even shorter charging cable. No play while charging, even if you have a cable capable of it. When you power it up the first time it annoys you to get the app and disables functionality until you get the app and connect it at least once.<br /><br />Why annoy the hell out of your customer right out of the gate? Well, I'm glad you asked. You see, it's all a scheme to steal your location data, so that advertisers can spy on you and serve you ads. When you attempt to pair the device over bluetooth it demands access to your location data. Connecting bluetooth has never once ever required location data from your phone, and it never will. This is Bose lying to your face for their gain. I'm mad, but not surprised, that Google and presumably Apple as well, allow their app on the store. The executives and product designers behind implementing that prompt (which may actually be an illegal request for unnecessary location data due to your inability to refuse giving it and still continue using your $300 headphones), should be barred from ever being in control of anything significant ever again in their lives as they're obviously a hazard to the well-being of their peers when given any sort of influence.<br /><br />And Bose rep, before you respond saying you need it to find my device, just save the lying for someone who doesn't understand the tech.<br /><br />I've never encountered something this maddeningly stupid from a piece of tech before, and given an opportunity I'd advise anyone to never touch another Bose product for as long as they live. I sure as hell never will. I'd return these instantly if I knew Amazon wouldn't throw them in a landfill instead of selling them as refurbished.",[],B098FKXT8L,B0BH6V8TTG,AH2XK4MOB6QIRB24LCP2LZ7ETADQ,2023-03-18 16:45:37.822,13,True,509
247150,4,"Cool Microscope, But Not 800X","I ordered this so I could show my grandson how things look when they are magnified.<br /><br />This is a nice handheld microscope with a built-in LCD screen.  The unit comes with a carrying case, microSD card, set of specimen slides, and USB charging cable.<br /><br />To use the microscope, you just hold it over the object you want to look at.  If you want to look at a bug, for example, just place the bug on a flat surface and lower the microscope all the way down to the surface.  A built-in LED light will illuminate the object.  You can focus by using the focus knob located near the end of the microscope.  It does a great job magnifying small objects.  I have no idea, to be honest, why the manufacturer would claim 800X magnification.  It is nowhere near that.  Using the slide of human blood that is included, it is obvious that you are not magnifying by 800X.  At that magnification level, you would be able to see individual red blood cells.  You cannot see individual cells with this microscope.<br /><br />I don't really consider the lack of 800X magnification to be a major negative, though, at least not for the purpose I ordered this microscope for.  It does a fantastic job on common, everyday objects that my grandson would be interested in.  An ant looks particularly fearsome under this microscope.  The individual strands in the threads that make up fabrics, the root of a human hair, the printing of a photo in a magazine or newspaper -- all of these are examples of great things to look at with this microscope.<br /><br />This microscope is listed as being for adults and for kids.  Based on my usage, I would say that focusing is going to be difficult for younger kids.  But, they don't need a cell phone or tablet running an app to use the microscope thanks to the built-in screen.  It is small, but it provides a nice, clear, bright image.<br /><br />As a test, I connected the microscope with the USB cord to my Windows 10 computer.  The computer recognized the microscope and I was able to view images on the screen using the Windows 10 built in Pictures app.<br /><br />This microscope costs a bit more than others, but the LCD screen, overall ease of use, and sharp clear imaging make it worth the few extra dollars.",[],B0BPCBWB9M,B0C27QVD6T,AEBE2MSZ5WBXECIZW22C5GTT6ZLA,2023-02-06 05:44:54.135,1,False,509
281098,5,Provides peace of mind for accidents and theft,"Bought this because I got into an accident recently and the other person was super shady. I unfortunately didn’t have any good proof or a third party witness so it became a he-said she-said situation. Anyways, got this as backup the next time anything happens to me.<br /><br />The installation was not too difficult. I am not exactly a car person so if I can do it, most people should be able to imo. If you follow the qr code provided in the pamphlet in addition to the user manual / instructions, it takes you to an instructional video that was super helpful and easy to follow. I recommend hiding the cables/wires by removing the panels and tucking them in the trim rather than running it along the top edge. It looks more seamless that way. The size of this dashcam suited my purpose since I didn’t want a bulky one with a screen, which to me is totally unnecessary since I can see everything from the app/on my phone. This one tucks nicely behind my rear view mirror and the rear cam is also not too obtrusive.<br /><br />Now this is my first dashcam so to me, the quality of the video looks pretty clear. Haven’t  had any problems capturing license plates and the night vision works surprisingly well. But then again I haven’t tested it in a scenario where there is absolutely zero street lights. Most of the time there is some ambient light somewhere and the exposure sensitivity of the camera does a good job capturing what I can see with my eyes.<br /><br />Oh also this cam is handy for me not just in the case of accidents but in the case of theft because I drive in a car that tends to get hit a lot. With the rise of catalytic converter thefts, I have gotten a bit paranoid and like that this dash cam has a parking monitor and the angle of the lens is wide enough to capture most people that pass by. While there are minor blind spots, it would be hard for someone to approach without being partially captured. It isn’t foolproof but it does give me at least an added layer of security.<br /><br />All in all, I like this product so far. Not sure about the construction quality and longevity but will update should anything happens. There supposedly is technical and customer support offered for at least 1 year so we will see if they will honor that should the device start glitching.",[],B0BLRY69RW,B0BLRY69RW,AHFW6BT2ADRORE47CHPI2CRTXSYA,2023-03-09 22:11:20.096,3,True,509
844533,5,Wow! Another game changer from DJI!,"[[VIDEOID:996131c65e6a42c5cdef9ea3a808c190]] OK, OK. Maybe not a total game changer…, But definitely a super useful piece of kit for all the smaller cinema cameras that are coming out.<br /><br />Before I get into my review, I just want to say that I highly recommend this gimbal… With the caveat that you obviously keep the weight of your camera and lens set up within the specified weight of the gimbal. I run a Sony FX3 with a sigma Art 24-70 mm lens, and it balances fine… Though I am close to the end of all the adjustments for balancing.<br /><br /> I’ve had the original ronin, the ronin Mx, and the RS2. I tried another company’s smaller gimbal for my Sony a6500, but it was just not up to par with the motor algorithms like DJI’s. I was skeptical at first with the RS3 mini, but my wife of all people insisted I give it a try. We travel a lot for work and we’re always looking for ways to save on weight and size. it works just like it’s big brother and with my set up, I dare say even slightly better. For some reason with my RS2 I have issues with the motors when I add a variable ND filter on the front of my set up, but with this, whether I have it balanced for the filter or not, it works great!<br /><br />The one issue I had was when adjusting the roll, I was not able to get it perfect, as the included Arca Swiss mounting plate, wouldn’t slide over far enough. I fixed this issue by simply pulling the quick release off and flipping it around backwards.<br /><br />I do highly recommend watching some YouTube videos on how to balance your camera properly. As with this gimbal, if you are running a set up that is closer to the weight limit, mine is just over 3 pounds, you need to know the proper way to balance it to get things just right.<br /><br />I wish this came with a carrying case, but I’m sure I can find one that’ll fit it and it’s small enough that you can just throw it inside your camera bag and not take up too much room.",[],B0BLD1KBHQ,B0BS1764N5,AG5G2T3IVXWVKHUC2IPXON466R6Q,2023-02-01 16:23:00.309,2,False,509
437944,5,Great compact digital microscope - it's our new favorite thing,"This was one of those things where I had high hopes but low expectations.... fortunately, I was very pleasantly surprised on both counts. The microscope comes with a stand, plus a charging cable. The microscope needs to be charged for a few hours first. The microscope itself is very lightweight, while the base has is weighted to prevent it from falling over.<br /><br />That said, you won't always need to use the base; it's possible to hold the microscope like a flashlight and get some great views - it's probably easier that way for some things. The microscope broadcasts a WiFi signal that your cell phone connects to, and then you use an app to see the image on your phone.<br /><br />You can also connect it directly to your computer with the USB cable, but of course, you're a little limited in terms of portability at that point.<br /><br />The instructions were relatively easy to understand, but probably could be a little clearer. The app works fine and didn't crash at all (on a Samsung S20+). The images were colorful and sharp, much better than I was expecting, but I'm not sure of the magnification.<br /><br />The documentation states it can magnify between 50x and 1000x, but be aware it's a digital zoom, so the image quality rapdily degrades as you zoom in. However, I found the lowest magnification to be just fine.<br /><br />The images attached are of our wood dining table, a citrine crystal, a smoked almond and the print on a letter.<br /><br />My 7 year old son and I had a lot of fun trying out different things - including a bee, but I'll spare you those photos LOL<br /><br />I only have two minor gripes - firstly, it's not easy to see what each of the buttons on the microscope are for. It would be nice if they were marked in some way, otherwise you'll find yourself pushing the buttons randomly to get it to do what you want.<br /><br />Secondly, I wish the app would give some indication of what magnification you're using.<br /><br />Lastly, not a gripe, but a wish - I would love to have a small hard case for it, as this would be ideal for hiking, exploring and just travel in general.

380334,5,Impressive and Reliable,"I bought a dozen of these several months ago to put in some test equipment I am building, and have been very impressed.  I tried using the Intel stick PC with an Atom processor, but they were under-powered and had fan issues.  So when I looked for a replacement, fan-less was a key consideration.<br /><br />As with so much of the electronics on Amazon I had never heard of MeLE, and buying a dozen of these was a bit of calculated risk.  As it turns out, every single one installed thus far has performed beautifully.  They are very responsive and boot in about 15 seconds.  I am using with an industrial FHD touch screen and performance is very good.<br /><br />These get a bit toasty when running as they must move the heat out via convection.  You will want to be sure they have some room to breathe.<br /><br />I used wired Ethernet so I cannot attest to the WiFi capabilities, and I do not game so no experience with that.  I do think they would not do well with FPS games, but less performance-intensive games will probably be just fine.  I can say they run rings around the Atom-based stick PCs I had tried at first.  I can can compile code with little pain and my development environment doesn't crash for lack of resources.<br /><br />The power supply was my only beef at first.  It uses a USB-C connector, but it is NOT a USB-C compliant device.  MeLE warns you of this, but I tried anyway; no boot.  This means you either a) use the specific power adapter that comes with the computer, or b) cut the power cord and wire in your own.  I did the latter as I was using power blocks and had 12V readily available.  It turns out the power cable has two wires inside (not 20-some like USB-C).  One is red, the other black.  Red goes to +12V DC, black to ground.  Make sure you have at least a 2A power supply or the PC will be unstable.  This probably voids any warranty but no problems thus far.<br /><br />I expect to buy a another batch of these later this year for more test stands.  I have developed a good deal of trust that they are up to the task at hand, and far less expensive than every a modest micro-desktop.",[],B09ZNT9RWQ,B0BH3Z359T,AEQMWLZOMKMR3J7BC7YH5IW24GKA,2023-02-03 19:18:00.608,0,True,509
993376,4,Nice visuals and audio at the higher range but this is a very small monitor,"[[VIDEOID:cdba708c869ae7ae6a8c2bd46d21d3cf]] This is a cute little monitor that isn't much bigger than my hand. It is easy enough to use. All you need to do is plug it into your computer or phone and it automatically mirrors your screen. There's 2 ways to adjust it plus you can take the stand off and hang it instead (for instance, to use it as a display behind the seat in a car.) When I use it with my laptop, I attach the HDMI cable (provided) to both the monitor and laptop and it automatically both mirrors my laptop screen and also made the display and type on my screen be smaller. This adjusted to the normal settings I have it on, on my laptop, as soon as I disconnected the HDMI cable again.<br /><br />The visuals were good. Not stellar but really good. I liked the settings on my laptop (hadn't really adjusted them) better than the ones on the monitor, but I'm still happy with the monitor's settings. And you can adjust them somewhat.<br /><br />I'm not completely sure what uses most people would use this for - I would probably use a tablet instead of this monitor in most instances, since then I would not need to hook it up to a phone, tablet or computer....It's nice to extend your phone screen if you want to see something bigger but use your phone as your computer. It's something you could definitely take with you to a cafe, for instance, if you were typing on your phone, and you wanted a bigger screen to view it. However, at that point, with laptops being so extremely cheap these days, I'd probably just get a laptop. I guess it is smaller/lighter but with the stand it would be more awkward to carry.<br /><br />The speakers' output was amazing at the higher range. At the lower range, I was cringing. It works with earbuds/headphones so it's adjustable. And you could always attach a speaker to it, but again, with all these attachments, it seems easier and more convenient to use a laptop in most instances. Most laptop screens are bigger than 10.5 inches. There's a lot of tablets at lower price points than this monitor. I like the monitor but I'm not sure what exact use it was designed for since there seems to be more convenient alternatives at comparable or lower price points.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510naX6obsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510naX6obsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510naX6obsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511IvoA79xL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511IvoA79xL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511IvoA79xL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Dou9Bk1vL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Dou9Bk1vL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Dou9Bk1vL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51T8rQV6QeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51T8rQV6QeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51T8rQV6QeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51c4j8pJ+eL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51c4j8pJ+eL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51c4j8pJ+eL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51cidZlBsnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51cidZlBsnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51cidZlBsnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OXuQutXqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OXuQutXqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OXuQutXqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SRJCmaI8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SRJCmaI8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SRJCmaI8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61d2XYeMicL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61d2XYeMicL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61d2XYeMicL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pewP05rDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pewP05rDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pewP05rDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IjbEmDF6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IjbEmDF6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IjbEmDF6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81xPwHYuERL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81xPwHYuERL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81xPwHYuERL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BL14PB5D,B0C48WFQ8B,AEMT4Z7PQXET7YUZZTM3FUZOUL4Q,2023-02-22 01:18:06.191,0,False,509
381104,2,WARNING NOT COMPATIBLE WITH M2 MAC,"I’m trying not to be too salty here as my experience with this tablet was really bad. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my daughter and when I hooked it up to my MacBook I got the grey lines pictured. I followed troubleshooting steps on the website and read through countless message boards with no solution. I contacted XP pen and they took me through the same troubleshooting steps as the website making me send screen shots of everything I did to prove I was doing it right. They then told me my adapter was bad (tablet needs an HDMI input and USB-A which aren’t on most modern computers) even though it worked on my other monitor so I went and bought one but got the same result. XP Pen would only respond to one email per day so by this point it had been a week with a useless Christmas gift. I tried the tablet on an old Dell and it worked. XP pen said it must be my MacBook. So I contacted apple and spent a day with them. We created a new library on my hard drive to make sure other software wasn’t interfering, same result. Apple suggested I try it with another MacBook. I found a friend with a MacBook with an Intel chip and it worked. Another friend had an M2 chip running Monterey (mine was Ventura) and it didn’t work. I got back with XP pen and told them and they said it ran on their M2 MacBooks so I asked they send me pics of how they hooked it up and their adapter so I could replicate it and they ignored me. After a couple of days I reached back out and they told me they had turned the problem over to R&D and didn’t know if or when they would get back to me and that I should probably purchase another brand. Two weeks of working on this with Apples help, and I’m decently tech savvy myself. XP pen never offered to replace the tablet or the cable, just blame it on my computer or adapter since it worked with my old dell. I just sent it back and bought a Wacom One.

73748,4,"Better than expected, but definitely not equivalent to good hybrid IEMs.","This review is for the KZ ZST in-ear-monitor (IEM) featuring a hybrid configuration with one balanced armature for highs and mids and one dynamic driver for bass. Specifically, I ordered the colorful model (which looks like something Harley Quinn would wear) without a microphone. Over the years, I've owned more than my fair share of relatively high-end headphones and IEMs, and frankly, I'm shocked that a dual-driver IEM is available for less than $20. I recall paying over $200 for a dual balanced armature model roughly ten years ago.<br /><br />The KZ ZST offers good sound for the money, but the results are different from what I'd expect from such a driver configuration. The dynamic driver produces powerful bass and is capable of deep rumbles, but the balanced armature's characteristic detail never comes through. I have dynamic earphones with equally good bass and much more detailed highs, but they cost $100. Compared to my single and dual balanced armature IEMs, the KZ ZST's bass is decidedly more powerful but somewhat muddy, and the mids to highs lacked clarity. For music that doesn't rely on a heavy bass track, there's no comparison, though.<br /><br />When it's all said and done, the KZ ZST sound better than what I'd expect from a $20 pair, but they're definitely not equivalent to a good hybrid IEM. Also, the included accessories are decidedly budget-oriented, which may also detract from the overall experience. For example, IEM ear hooks are typically made with memory wire to enable a custom fit, but the KZ ZST's ear hooks are non-adjustable. Isolation, fit, and comfort were acceptable, however. Another issue I experienced with the KZ ZSTs is that they're relatively low impedance with high sensitivity, meaning they're easy for portable devices to drive, but this was a double-edged sword. On an airplane, for example, I could hear a lot of hissing and popping from the in-flight entertainment system.<br /><br />Notes:<br />1) The cord I received doesn't differentiate between L/R and I initially had them swapped. You should listen to a test track to make sure they're set up correctly.<br />2) The rubber ear tips feature a rippled design that's a first for me. It seems like a gimmick to me.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715h5JilEvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715h5JilEvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715h5JilEvL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GXnzeHOuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GXnzeHOuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GXnzeHOuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BQR48NZD,B0C23J2B32,AFW3CAOLOJI3GGBAIUKTVD73ITMA,2023-01-18 10:27:17.101,0,False,509

Alerts are shrill & at 100% volume,"I purchased a pair of these Beribes headphones in March of 2022 and have been using them for 10 months. I'm not sure if there's been any changes to the designs or features since March '22, so please note that this review is for the model I received back then.<br /><br />Here are the pros: these headphones have great sound and good microphone quality for calls, even if I speak quietly! They stay connected even if I move across the house. I rarely experience disconnection issues. The noise suppression is good enough that I can still hear everything in a busy airport.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I personally can't recommend these headphones until the following issues may be addressed.<br /><br />CONNECTS AT 100%:<br /><br />Ears beware: these Beribes headphones almost always connect/reconnect to devices at 100% max volume. This is unfortunately super loud and undesirable.<br /><br />I had to remember to lower my volume from 100% every time I used these headphones. This was on a daily basis.<br /><br />I looked for a fix (outside of manually limiting my Bluetooth volume via my device settings, which was inconvenient when using multiple sound devices).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the manufacturer said this feature is on purpose and completely intended (in their replies on Amazon).<br /><br />VERY LOUD ALERTS:<br /><br />The following alerts always play at 100% max volume no matter what your device is set to:<br /><br />- Power on/off (very shrill beep)<br />- Call answered/hang up (very shrill beep)<br />- ""You have an incoming call""<br />- Headphone alerts<br /><br />People sitting across the room can easily hear these alerts going off when I'm wearing the headphones.<br /><br />SUDDEN SHRILL ERROR SOUND:<br /><br />9 months after purchase, these headphones occasionally emit a SUPER loud, prolonged, and high-pitched sound at random that lasts until I turn them off completely.<br /><br />I'm worried all this will cause ear discomfort or hearing loss over time for users.<br /><br />I ended up replacing these headphones with another brand due to these unfortunate features.

294395,5,Very nice and compact WIFI dashcam,"This is a really nice and compact dash cam that is easy to mount and easy to operate. Though I'm still learning, most of the initial configuration and operation functions are intuitive. After mounting the camera, I discovered a number of bubbles between the thin ""electrostatic sticker"" and the windshield. They're difficult to remove but other than the aesthetics, it's not a problem.When applying the sticker, I recommend starting from one edge or corner and slowly pressing the sticker to the windshield, pressing out the bubbles along the way. That said, even with the bubbles the dashcam is firmly mounted with no signs of instability.<br /><br />A great feature of this dashcam is the magnetic mount. In seconds you can easily remove or attach the camera. This enables you to easily store it for security reasons, to move it to another vehicle wired for the camera, or to plug it into your computer via included USB cable to quickly copy videos and photos directly to your computer.<br /><br />Video and picture quality are very good (not excellent) both day and night time with adequate detail. The buttons on the camera are easy to use and the remote control is very handy. I really enjoy having the ability to take a quick snapshot photo simply by pressing the button on the remote. The remote includes 3M adhesive for those who would like to permanently mount it in a convenient spot.<br /><br />I find the WIFI to be a very handy feature, allowing me to download photos and videos from the dashcam directly to my iPhone. I can easily switch to the dashcam's WIFI network to retrieve them (while not driving) and then switch back to Apple CarPlay. Another very nice feature of the WiFi is that it makes it much easier to configure and adjust the settings of the camera from your smartphone via the VantrueCam app.<br /><br />I use the included 12v adapter connected to the car's 12v ""cigarette lighter"" port and the cable was easy to route (and hide) with plenty of cable length provided. My car turns off power to the 12v supply after 15 minutes so no need to worry about the car's battery running down when not in use. There's a convenient accessory available to semi-permanently power the camera via the fuse box, necessary if you want to use the ""parking"" feature.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this dashcam. It's high quality and a good value.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Gtp8u17FL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Gtp8u17FL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Gtp8u17FL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VxpBedO2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VxpBedO2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VxpBedO2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DkRW7a-aL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DkRW7a-aL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DkRW7a-aL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Jbh4JPsVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Jbh4JPsVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Jbh4JPsVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eRB8NE9OL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eRB8NE9OL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eRB8NE9OL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B2W81VG6,B0B2W8NMHN,AFLA57CXXBFIMU4NCL5IKS6DJHXA,2023-02-08 18:29:59.032,0,True,509
61341,5,Perfect for M1 Max,"I spent over $4k on a CTO 16” M1 Max MacBook Pro, and I wanted to protect it. I’ve used other cases in the past on my MBPs and have been happy with the results. However, there’s so many more available now than there used to be that the options are almost overwhelming.<br /><br />I wanted some protection, but didn’t need the armored-car type that has thick bumpers all around it and added bulk. I wanted to keep the slick look of the machine and protect the iconic silver finish.<br /><br />For (at the time of review) $9.99 this is a rock star! It’s got a crystal clear shiny finish and snaps on perfectly. It feels strong and secure. It’s just what I needed to keep my beast looking new underneath. I can add stickers or leave it be without damaging the surface. The slick surface, makes it slide effortlessly in and out of my laptop sleeve in my bag.<br /><br />It came with a keyboard cover, that’s nice and thin, and will keep the crumbs and cat hair out of the crevices. I have another one that I like the tactile feel better but this one is frosted clear and more professional when visiting clients. This one is still great, and I type just as well with it.<br /><br />It also comes with a screen cleaning cloth that doubles as a travel mouse pad, with non-skid nubbins on the bottom. It’s pretty ingenious, I wish I would have had this years ago for all my business travel. Mouse pads don’t take up much room but this would have been a perfect solution, rather than using the desk in a hotel that didn’t slide well or on a piece of paper because the wood grain often screwed with the optical sensors. I want more of these to keep in all my business travel bags without taking up essential space!<br /><br />This is a great minimalist case for a 16” M1 Max MacBook Pro, if you’ve got more substantial protection like a sleeve or padded case when out and about. Like all cases like this, I wouldn’t trust the corners to last long floating around in a tote bag alone without padding as it’s not meant for substantial bangs and drops. For $10 this is a WINNER!",[],B09QYVF6F7,B0BCW81SZH,AEMOJBFGIACCYVM7A6POOHULNXPQ,2023-01-08 22:06:29.119,0,False,509
793647,3,I have a love/hate relationship with these headphones,"I ordered the OpenMove headset about two weeks before I ordered these.  I absolutely love the OpenMove.  Great sound without anything in my ears.  The OpenSwim. . . I'm undecided.  The OpenMove is great for my five mile daily walks and gym sessions.  I also lap swim a mile four days a week.  So I got the OpenSwim specifically for my swim workouts.<br />The first day I wore them I was unimpressed with the sound I got while at home loading up some MP3's.  Particularly since I was so happy with the sound from the OpenMove.  I swam a lap and was extraordinarily disappointed.  I couldn't hear a thing during my freestyle and kickboard work out. During my freestyle, there was just too much noise from my arm strokes to hear the music.  During my kickboard workout the music quality was just terrible.  But when I fully submerged my head under water...Holy Cow!  What fantastic sound.  The problem is, of course, I'm rarely submerged while I swim.  I don't ordinarily do turn kicks because it takes too much out of me.  So even though I like the concept of not having anything inserted in my ears, for the last week I've been swimming with ear plugs in.<br />There's a marked difference in sound quality for the better with ear plugs in.  However, the music quality is still terrible while I'm doing my freestyle strokes. I'll compare it to having a radio playing by the side of the pool.  You know it's playing music, but you can't tell what song, or even what type of music, is playing. But my kickboard workout is much more enjoyable. BUT, the problem that I was trying to avoid by not having in-ear headphones is painfully smacking me in the face.  With the ear plugs in I can't hear a single thing going on around me at the pool.  I can't carry on a conversation with my lane neighbor.  I can't hear people calling me to get my attention.  I hate being so situationally unaware.  It reminds me of visiting NYC a couple years back and looking at all the idiots on the subway with junk in their ears.  None of them knew what the heck was going on around them.  I'll try them out for another week.  But for the price, I just don't think they're worth it.",[],B09CGP8MVH,B09F5MZPHZ,AGOTQJS3QBTH2PNPRLVQSQ4ZVPSA,2023-01-21 05:20:06.488,5,True,509
49643,5,"Works great, awesome value!!","I was a little skeptical going into this purchase due to the price so my expectations were low!<br />Upon arrival, which arrived a couple days later (USPS, they're not the greatest), this thing is pretty small and nice looking device!<br />It came with the device itself, a short (stubby) 3.5mm to 3.5mm jack, a short 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable, and a USB to type C cable to charge device. It was easy to pair to my old Note9 phone (I used short stubby adapter to connect to my radio). The lights on it is intuitive to let you know the status of device.<br />The device has several controls on board for volume control, voice answering phone calls etc (haven't tested that yet). I left my volume set to max on device along with my phone set to max volume and just controlled master volume through the radio. I must say, I was using a good quality 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable before that was becoming annoying, but this device for some reason has improved the sound quality of the music! I noticed that I didn't have to increase the master radio volume as much as before and the sound quality was much crisper, bass was puncher (even with one of my speaker being slightly blown)! This device must be processing the sound better or something before entering the radio, I don't know! Yes you have to connect to it each time you turn it on (not automatic) but it's a miner gripe for me and will give it a pass due to the value and impressive sound I'm getting from this thing not to mention no more long cable hanging around again! It was said by some that when in use and plugged in for charging in cigarette lighter (which is great that you can do) can make/ have that awful buzzing sound (interference) coming from it (my older cable did it/ unusable when I plugged and charged my phone), the sound was extremely minimal was there but for me it was minimal! Now I haven't tried charging my phone when operating this device to see if there's any interference yet! I still have to test other features but so far I would definitely buy another one if need be so far, great value at $12.50 (less than 1.5 dozen of extra large eggs these days🤣)!

799306,3,Not bad for the price,"Probably the best thing about these headphones is the price. My current headset is the Bose NC700. And while these clearly don't compete directly with the Bose headset in pretty much any category, they are also 1/8th of the price and still quite functional. In my testing, I used these for a day of work connected over bluetooth to my laptop running Ubuntu 22.10 and a Google Pixel phone. Over the course of the day I wore these for stretches up to several hours, joined several calls on Microsoft Teams, listened to recorded meetings and to music, and took a phone call.<br /><br />I like the over-the-ear design. I have large ears and found the cups on this headset to be just a tiny bit smaller than I would have hoped for. After multiple hours of wearing these, my ears were aching a tiny bit from the pressure. The sound quality of this headset was fine for meetings but I detected a bit of warbling when listening to music. I'm not much of an audiophile, but imagine that this would be annoying for anyone that was. The mic seemed to work OK. I did not get any complaints about my audibility on computer calls, but when taking a call on my phone the caller said I was breaking up a bit. The noise cancelling is not quite as good as the Bose, but that's not a huge surprise. Range on these were about the same as my Bose headphones. I could get up and walk several rooms away from my desk without losing audio.<br /><br />Connecting the device was pretty straightforward. However, after turning the device off and then back on again, my computer did not seem to automatically reconnect the audio. I had to manually disconnect and reconnect the device from with the computer's bluetooth settings to get audio again. This may be an oddity of Ubuntu rather than the headset, but it's not a problem that I have when using my NC700's. I was able to simultaneously connect to both my phone and computer. This is a nifty feature that allows me to answer a call while otherwise connected to laptop audio. But to get both devices to pair I had to turn the bluetooth off on one device to get the headset back into a pairing mode. The buttons on the headset worked well to answer the phone call without having to reach for the actual phone.<br /><br />All in all, these aren't a great headset, but not bad for the money.",[],B0BXGRNSX9,B0BXGRNSX9,AGHSKPTSMUL22C2T3MSCLIRQC5XA,2023-04-14 22:05:19.975,0,False,509

As a display, this thing is AMAZING. The picture quality is very good. The brightness, the blacks, the latency, the color, everything. Top notch.<br /><br />But the software and manufacturer's decisions really let this thing down big time.<br /><br />Almost every time you turn on this TV you will be greeted with ""notifications."" These are mostly advertisements for new ways the TV can sell you features and apps. Sometimes they're about updates. Sometimes they're about taking a feature away. Whatever they are, they appear for a few seconds each, and you can't disable them. Expect it to be a full minute between when you want to use your TV and when it actually lets you use it, rather than LG using it as a billboard.<br /><br />You CAN disable the notifications by telling the TV it's region is somewhere outside of the supported countries. But if you do that it disables Alexa and HomeKit and AirPlay and a bunch of other features that have no reasonable reason to be region locked. So you have to pick between being free of obnoxious notifications and ads, or having access to the features you paid for.  You can't have both.<br /><br />Then there's the apps. Most of them are OK. Fine. Same as on any TV. But some of them, for whatever reason, require you to make an LG account to download them. Why? Who cares. LG doesn't need to or deserve to know what I use MY TV for. Not their TV, MY TV. Additionally, there are some important apps missing. No MLB.tv for example. I know it's up to MLB to decide to put their app on LG, but for LG that's a pretty big deal. Get a deal done with MLB and get the app back on there. Or use some other OS that supports MLB and give up the control you have to track me on ... again ...

I can drop it in my purse any time I go out;  you never know when you’ll find a few minutes to read, instead of wasting that time playing on a cell phone!<br /><br />Years ago, I resisted switching over to a Kindle because I preferred the feel of a book in my hand, and the satisfaction of physically turning each page.<br /><br />As the years passed, while becoming accustomed to electronic devices being part of everyday life, I now realize that physically holding a book, and the tactile pleasure of turning pages was not being enjoyed because I was no longer reading at all.<br /><br />Getting my Kindle has shown me what’s most important:  It has given back to me the ability to enjoy reading again.<br /><br />I am particularly pleased with the features of the new Kindle Paperwhite, but for anyone with a more limited budget, I have no doubt that the less expensive versions can also bring the joy of reading back into anyone’s life if they experienced the same gradual straying away from daily reading that I did.

741059,4,"It's not a can of compressed air, but it's the next best thing","I got tired of spending money buying cans of compressed air, forgetting to get new cans and not having them when I need them, all of that. This popped up for me right around the time I was thinking about getting an electric duster, so I took it as a sign. Now, here we are.<br /><br />First off, it's soft-touch. Yep, that satiny-smooth finish that's destined to melt back into petroleum goo in a few years. Not thrilled about that, but in the mean time it feels really nice in the hand!<br /><br />It features four strengths. For the sake of dusting, I only use the full strength. There is a master power button on the bottom, along with a power/charging light that indicates how much power is left in the charge. The trigger button lights up different colors to visually indicate what strength is selected. It's a nice touch, as I have in fact lost track of the setting on it a few times, so the visual reminder is nice. It comes with three attachments, a narrow nozzle to focus the air for stronger dusting, a nozzle with a brush that's good for the keyboard or other areas where you may need to agitate the dust a little, and a wide angle nozzle that I take to be for drying your hair. Yes, the instructions say you can use this to dry your hair, as well. Which, honestly, is kinda nice. I don't like to blow dry my hair because it really doesn't like the heat, but this doesn't get hot, so it's rather convenient for me to take some of the dampness out of my hair after a shower. But really, it's not a hair dryer, don't expect it to do well for that.<br /><br />As for dusting, it works decently well. It's not as good as a can of compressed air, which it won't be because the air isn't focused nearly as tightly as it is through that straw on the cans, but it still works pretty well. If dust isn't allowed to cake up to where it wants to stick, this does a good job of blowing it off. If it does get a bit caked, the brush nozzle helps a lot. For the majority of my dusting needs, this will work just fine.<br /><br />Good price, good blower. Definitely happy with it, I'd recommend it to others.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gdwmUn0IL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gdwmUn0IL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gdwmUn0IL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iyQoQzs2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iyQoQzs2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iyQoQzs2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BQLKC3XV,B0BQLKC3XV,AEFVUDTSMO5ETVYHPTLMJP4ZCEHQ,2023-03-23 06:12:55.893,0,False,509
2554,5,Pretty darn good…hoping for a few tweaks in the app. Though.,"We were forced to upgrade from our Arlo camera system when Arlo unceremoniously emailed us telling us (despite the fact that they still worked perfectly) that they were “end-of-life” ing our Arlo system.  Well, of course we’ll never use Arlo products again for that FU from them, so we found these.<br /><br />They seem well made, at least feel as sturdy as our old cameras do, and the picture quality is very, very good esp on “QHD” setting.  The Wi-Fi connection to each of the camera seems very robust despite the fact that we still have one older Wi-Fi router serving our household, not a newer “mesh” or similar system. All 5 of these ieGeek cameras we have scattered around our property have been nearly bulletproof connectivity-wise so far. Impressed.<br /><br />The set-up was easy, but the App feels somewhat clunky to us, BUT that may be due to the fact that we are having to re-learn from an app we are longtime users of with our prior cameras system.  Time will tell but functionality is good.<br /><br />Per the title of this review, I DO hope they had some additional “image” related settings which would allow zoom, pan, and some lightening/darkening of the image (esp. on a bright sunny day).  Also, some scheduling settings enhancements would be nice to avoid un-needed alerts during certain times of day when family routinely comes and goes, etc.  These are all simple enough tweaks/improvements to an app which I hope ieGeek pushes out at some point which would make a pretty darned good system even better.<br /><br />My biggest gripe with these is the mounting brackets which in a word are….terrible.  They are plastic, and VERY hard to adequately tighten when precision aiming the cameras for best results. They really cheapen the experience but I eventually have them all set up, hopefully the brackets will hold in place as aimed once they start to broil in our hot So Cal summer.  They need to up their game on the mounting brackets!<br /><br />All in all we are happy though, and despite my opinion of the app needing some tweaks, these do exactly what we need them to.  I hope the improve those darned brackets too.",[],B0BLZJJ2L5,B0BQRB9G3Y,AE6MW3F7GY3T3GBM34X6M7DGTGKA,2023-01-28 21:55:20.799,5,True,509
781575,5,Very small and light but made extremely well,"This USB hub is a very nice unit. I was surprised when I removed it from the box and gave it a look to see how it was laid out and the build quality. The first thing I noticed is the outer casing. It is an all aluminum case which is a dark grey color and is anodized. The unit itself is very solid and very easy to carry. The ports are all of high quality and are nice and flush with the outside of the case. The micro SD slot, SD slot, Ethernet port, and the HDMI port are all made directly into the body of the case which makes for a very attractive look and design. It has a small blue LED on the top to let you know it has power which is bright enough to see in the daylight but not so bright its obtrusive or distracting. The cord is very short at about 6 inches or 160mm and terminates into a USB type C plug. I have used every feature this little hub offers and everything works flawlessly. The onboard Gigabit ethernet port works straight away without any need to install drivers or change anything in Windows. The HDMI port also works great and came on as soon as I plugged it up. I could not successfully get the HDMI and ethernet port to work simultaniously but I don't think they were meant to as there wouldn't be enough bandwidth to carry both signals at the same time over the USB 3.1 bus. There is also a port on the side which lets you charge things such as a laptop or phone and maxes out at 100Watts. There are 3 USB 3.1 Type A ports on the other side where the MicroSD and SD slots are located. It's nice to have a hub this powerful work right out of the box with HDMI and ethernet and do this without an external power adapter. I have been using this for a few days now and I am very pleased with it. The price is very good for the quality you recieve. No drivers, no fuss, just plug it in and go. That's the way USB hubs should be and do it all without some clumsy external power adapter you have to lug around with the hub and have to be near a power outlet to even use it. This unit is truly portable and is a must have for those individuals on the go and need a few more ports to plug things into or another HDMI for a projector, etc. You can't go wrong here for the price and you won't be disappointed with the quality.",[],B0BNL99JYP,B0BXD34MSH,AGVHWQ7DO444HSUGQBLO4LIHZR6A,2023-02-19 02:47:15.390,0,False,509
756460,5,"Beautiful, Comfortable, & Loud - A HIDDEN GEM!!!!!!","So, truth be told, I rarely write a review.  But I had to, guys.  So recently I've found myself buying earbuds, after earbuds.  In the space of 2 months, I've purchased (in this order); Sony's wf-1000xm3, Beats Studio Buds, Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Sony's wf-1000xm4, and finally, my real favorite - the least expensive of them all, (I had to buy the Sony and Samsung buds refurbished) the unbelievable fabulous Tempo 30 earbuds from Back Bay!  In the first place, these are the only earbuds that fit my small ears, which makes them the best by default.  Every set had a warning preceding their purchase, that if the buds don't fit, you will not be able to enjoy them properly.  But I was beginning to think that earbuds were just supposed to lay on my ear tucked behind some cartilage, because how could Sony and Samsung both get it wrong for folks with small ears?  Sony's wf-1000xm4 sounded beautiful, and came closer to my ear canal than the others. In truth, if they had all fit me properly, it might change this review.  But it can't change the fact that I only paid $45.00 for them.  They came in the smallest case of them all, the rose gold is quite elegant, and they appear to be very well made.  I'm not an audiophile in any kind of technical sense but the sound was incredible to me.  I achieved a volume which I couldn't seem to achieve with the other buds.  The Beats Studio buds came the closest in volume, but I watched Youtube reviewers, all of which said the volume of these buds were unmatched.  I had no problems connecting to any of my devices.  And the one thing I can say is a ""con"" is that I had some difficulty with the controls.  But I think this might be a ""user"" issue, because I was the kid that had to practice all summer using scissors.  I'm sure the fact that they fit me for a change has everything to do with my joy in terms of these earbuds, but I challenge anyone to a duel.  These earbuds, the little known Tempo 30 from Back Bay, are seriously lovely.  A true diamond in the rough.  I'm really pleased.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51EYd9atinL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51EYd9atinL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51EYd9atinL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09DLF7DQY,B09DB8XK9Y,AGSSERYNBBSGOYDB6VOUB7ZTDULQ,2023-04-29 00:52:03.628,14,True,509
41375,5,Great Replacement!,"My original case had been getting temperamental about charging.  It would connect initially, then stop charging, then just stopped altogether.  I tried cleaning the charging port, trying different chargers, wireless charging, resetting, various suggestions from Google, etc.  I certainly wasn’t going to pay Apple what they want for a new case.  I thought the reviews on this were decent, and more than anything it had same day delivery.  I got it just a few hours after I ordered.<br /><br />I’m so glad someone posted the photo of their instructions, or rather their key of what the various lights mean since the colors vary a bit from the original, mine didn’t come with instructions except for a sticker on the case that said to charge for at least 15 minutes before trying to sync it.  I charged and it synced just like usual.  Look for that review if you need that!<br /><br />It charges just fine wired and wirelessly.  It does take a bit longer to charge, and the airpods don’t last quite as long.  I did heed the warning about how hot the case gets when charging wirelessly, so I take the airpods out before I do that so I don’t risk them getting warped.  Others mentioned this as well, but when you open the case and look at your phone to check the charge status, it takes a moment to show up rather than instant like the original case.<br /><br />As other reviews have mentioned, it is a bit lighter than the original case.  The hinge looks a bit different from the outside and is a little looser than the original when opening and closing.  The last difference I noticed is that the button is on the front vs. the back.  These things don’t bother me at all as the case is just a way to charge the airpods, but if that’s important to you those are the facts.  It does look identical otherwise.  I wouldn’t have noticed any of those things if I hadn’t had them both in my hands comparing them.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great purchase!  I think most of us realize when we buy a generic piece to replace a brand name piece that the quality is not going to be exactly the same.

Nothing seems to help get the device to stop hitting the volume button or home button on its own. This is now worthless to even keep. I have a video attached on how it’s glitching. It was 90°F outside today for reference.<br />UPDATE AS OF MARCH 2023: I’ve noticed when there’s a bit more heat, the device seems to act as if I’m pressing the volume buttons and the menu button but I’m not. I’ve noticed after hitting factory reset on the device set up, it seems fine for a bit. But other than that, it seems to work well! I’ve also noticed when I try to call anyone they cannot hear me, it’s just a static noise on their end. It’s the same when I try to record anything from my phone while it’s connected wirelessly or via usb. But again, other than the glitches & mic issue, it seems to work fairly well for 2012 Chevy Cruze!<br /><br />I have been SEARCHING for something that’ll work with my 2012 Chevy Cruze without all the complications of having to change out the stereo and wires and all and I’ve found one finally! This was actually super easy to set up surprisingly too. The adhesive sticks pretty well on the windshield, we’ll see how it handles in the summer here in Arizona! Hopefully I’ll remember to update this in the summer :P so far I’m pretty happy with this purchase honestly! Not sure how well it works for android phones since I have an iPhone 11 Pro, but it works like any other car play! There’s one piece I’m not sure what it’s supposed to be for yet but I didn’t really need it, just the arm piece with the suction and the CarPlay device and the shade thing you click into place. The unfortunate thing I have to say is the auxiliary cable was too short from the windshield to the center console where the auxiliary port is so I had to use another one that was longer that I thankfully already had.

638935,4,An interesting upgrade,"There are parts of this pair of earbuds that I really like, and parts I really don't.<br />Pros:<br />Type c charging<br />Speedy charging<br />Screen on case is convenient<br />Touch controls work pretty well<br />Cons:<br />Case feels cheap<br />Sound quality is maybe a 7/10. Could be better, especially for the proposed full price before sales<br />Earbud shape is a bit odd and doesn't fit as well as others for me personally.<br /><br />The case:<br />The screen on the case is very convenient. It's bright, the 'animation' is perfect and speedy, and it's easy to interpret. However the actual build quality is just okay. It's all plastic, and it's very lightweight. You are told to be careful not to drop them in the instructions, and when you do the earbuds fall out. I dropped them in the parking lot once and the black earbuds landed on the black pavement and I was worried I was doomed. So, since you're warned, I can't necessarily complain. Just keep it in mind if you happen to be clumsy.<br /><br />The buds:<br />I'm not a huge fan of the shape. They don't stay in my ear as well as other buds I've owned in the past. If you're used to the buds that are wider and don't have the long stem, these might not be as comfortable. It took me a bit to get used to them. However they're not terrible at all. You can customize the size of the plastic pieces to get a better fit of course, and that's definitely necessary. The sound quality is not bad. Not too much base but it's clear and easy to understand. Nothing to write home about but I also can't complain. They're a little quieter than others I've had but they still get plenty loud. They connect very quickly and don't talk or beep at me as much or as often as other pairs have. The battery is great and I can't rave enough about the fact that they are usb-c instead of b. They get all 4 stars just for that.<br /><br />So, when I bought them they were originally 130 dollars. I bought them for like 20. If I'd paid 130 dollars, I'd be devastated.

377246,5,Review of the C11 Black by an Experienced Headphones User,"In these COVID times, I've gone overboard buying all kinds of headphones.  I don't like to put things in my ears sometimes so, for on the go, I have, along with earbuds, lots of open ear headphones -- several expensive, major brand bone conduction headphones, several budget bone conduction headphones, and one pair of headphones that, like the C11, is  air conduction -- sending sound directly into the ear.<br /><br />The C11 are the best of the open ear headphones that I have, including the expensive bone conduction, for sound quality and equal to the high end bone conduction for phone call quality.  Like all open ear headphones, the sound is not as full-bodied as earbuds--it is limited in bass, but the sound on the C11 has a balance of bass, mids and treble that is superior to the other bone conduction and air conduction headphones that I have, making it noticeably less tinny and, unlike the others, enjoyable to use for music as well as spoken word.  The C11 do not stream the LDAC codec that my phone allows, but do stream AAC.  They are clear and have separation of instruments, but (like the other open ear phones using the AAC or SBC codecs) do not have any sound stage to speak of.  No noticeable distortion at high volume.<br /><br />I am a large person, and the C11 fit very comfortably and lightly on my ears -- including because there's a little give in the ear loops.  I've worn them for about two hours so far with no discomfort at all.  They can be used one at a time too.<br /><br />The case is not too heavy or big, and it and the headphones charge as advertised, the case using a type C cable.  The battery life appears to be as long as advertised -- which, because of the case's charging ability, is much longer than the other open ear headphones I have for being out and about.  The controls take a little getting used to, but work flawlessly.  The C11 connects to only one device at a time.<br /><br />At the time I write this, the C11 appear to be unique on Amazon -- meaning, they are the only quality true wireless air conduction headphones with very long battery life that I could find.  For what I paid, I'm very happy with this purchase.",[],B0BLN8N91N,B0CBMPG524,AFN5RIIKNDJ2DU2DEJNHI7RU4TYQ,2023-01-27 05:49:45.956,5,True,509
971500,5,"Insane quality, picture, and motion for an unbeatable price.","I've never had a reason to dislike my 27"" Sceptre monitors. I'm used to having a 22"" monitor and a 24"" monitor at work,  but I've always thought that they needed to be bigger. Once I set up my office the way I really wanted it, I decided on having a dual 27"" monitor setup. I've liked it a lot, but when I saw the option to grab this monitor while it was still in stock, I had to take it.<br /><br />PROS<br />This is a BIG monitor, and the picture is great. It's nice and sharp, and the motion is really great as well. I know there's a lot of enthusiasts out there who can't wait to tell me how wrong I am, but for someone who doesn't need the top of the line, I'm very happy with this.<br /><br />It still has a VESA mount, despite its size. For anyone wondering, it needs risers in order to work.<br /><br />The LED strip on the back is a neat touch.<br /><br />The borders are really small, so you get a lot more out of the picture itself.<br /><br />The backlighting is incredible. Despite how bright it is, it's easily turned down either from your system, or the monitor itself.<br /><br />CONS<br />This boi is H E A V Y. If you already have a dual-monitor mount at home, make sure it can support the weight. If it can support over 20lbs, you should be fine. Anything else, it will weight it down immediately. If you have a mount that has a straight pole with the arms that hold your monitors, it'll definitely get weighed down by this beast.<br /><br />There seems to be a slight buzzing/humming sound coming from the monitor when its on. I usually have headphones on at my desk, but I could imagine that it could be problematic for those with exceptional hearing.<br /><br />Overall, I don't think that you can find a better value for a monitor. What you get with this vs.  what you pay is astounding. I've used Alienware and LG monitors that don't seem as good, or are as good, but with an additional $500 on the price. For anyone looking to game or work in style and on a budget, look no further than Sceptre.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51kh41eI7PL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51kh41eI7PL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51kh41eI7PL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61P2Uaq8ndL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61P2Uaq8ndL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61P2Uaq8ndL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fIelj8KLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fIelj8KLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fIelj8KLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71chlrfWdqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71chlrfWdqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71chlrfWdqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Hc-XMX+wL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Hc-XMX+wL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Hc-XMX+wL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08VTW474P,B08X2MRQS8,AGLLINULKPSWFUNYGM75VCMDCHYA,2023-04-16 04:44:38.444,0,True,509
395744,5,Amazing headphones at a decent price! The companion app is great!,"I want to prefix my review by just saying, I really like these headphones. They have so much customizations and features that they have become by daily use headphones.<br /><br />They arrived in a small branded box packed full of stuff. There are multiple sets of ear buds so you can fit them to whatever size you need. The box included a single card ""quickguide"" and I had them paired and ready to use with my phone instantly.<br /><br />The headphones themselves are slick looking, and respond to touch, no need to press a button on them. The default setting is to tap left to turn down, tap right to turn up, and double tap either to pause / unpause. I love the settings out of the box, but if you don't then don't worry, you can change them with the app!<br /><br />Out of the box the sound is pretty decent. But the app is where things shine for customizations. There are multiple pre-build noise reduction filters, and three different types of modes to pick from. I have been using TRANS mode because it allows for ambient noise to pass through into the headphones! This keeps me alert to the sounds around me while I am out and about and I can hold conversations while keeping them in. The other modes help block out noise entirely. So lots to pick from with a bunch of default sub settings to play with.<br /><br />I liked that it has several listening types for equalization, the only one I found missing was for podcasts / audio books. Luckily you can add your own and I quickly set one up for ""books"" and saved it. SO NICE!<br /><br />As for other features of the headphones. The battery is pretty decent, lasting me a full day of use with the charging case. I have noticed that the app tells me that the right ear bud seems to drain faster for some reason. The bluetooth range is okay. I own several other pairs and they seem to have a longer range. There is a loud noise that goes off when you disconnect or reconnect so you will know for sure when you get outside the range. It is worth also knowing that there are two white LEDs that constantly blink on the headphones when using.

11906,3,"UPDATED REVIEW: First one was a dud, replacement is good so far.","SECOND UPDATE: After the first one of these began to fail within a day, I decided to swap it out for another one. Amazon was great about sending the replacement and letting me send the defective item back in. So far the replacement sounds great and I hope that it keeps on working. I still say it’s worth the tube swap (the manual even says it’s fine to swap tubes so don’t sweat that). For now I’ve revised the rating to 3-star until I have the replacement a bit longer. I’ll update this review in time.<br /><br />UPDATE: I’m less than 24 hours in and this amp is already cutting out on the right channel. Looks like this one is going back.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: Bought this to pair with my Fluance RT-81 turntable. Although the RT-81 has an internal preamp, I found the tone to be pretty flat and lifeless. After doing a bit of research, I decided to give this T3 phono preamp a shot.<br /><br />Install is simple. Run a two-channel RCA cable from the turntable to the amp and a second two-channel cable from the amp to the main amp/receiver. Keep in mind the preamp doesn’t include any two-channel RCA audio cables so grab those when you order (the product includes a single 3.5mm to RCA cable). Plug in the included tubes, then the audio cable, and you’re in business. The size is minimal, but build quality seems good for the price. The blue LEDs are a nice touch and aren’t so bright that they are distracting.<br /><br />With the stock generic tubes the sound was an improvement over stock preamp in the RT-81, but I found the midrange was a bit lacking. Fortunately I had ordered a set of GE JAN 5654W tubes from Riverstone Audio (these tubes are likely suggested on this project page). When I installed these tubes, the tone really came alive! The mids and lows are full and the highs are more mellow. If you’re considering this T3 preamp, I strongly encourage you to spend a few bucks more and get the upgraded tubes.<br /><br />Assuming it holds up over time, this preamp is a win, especially with the GE tube upgrade.",[],B07XL1CM3X,B07XL1CM3X,AFNE7HJ47POZQSWQI3NCPSJ7RB5Q,2023-01-10 19:16:04.150,0,True,509
190840,4,Battery Life is Incredible!,"I got these for Christmas and I use them all day long. I work in a setting where I have to hear people talk to me and I’m not allowed to wear in ear headphone due to obstruction. So these headphones are a life saver! If you think you’re going to get in-ear quality sound-you’re daft. They’re open ear-bone conduction—-duh! They sound ambient, almost like you’re listening to the radio. Only no one can hear that radio. I wear them for 13 hours a day (continuous) and I’m barely on medium! Think about that. You could go on a two day camping trip with these guys and be fine. Think of all the stuff you do that you can do more of and longer with headphones that don’t die at 4-6 hrs. Apple earbuds die at 4-6 hr mark, my Dre beats die at 6 hrs. But these headphones go strong all day.<br /><br />My only complaint is better controls. I wish it was a touch sensor or voice commanded, because touching the unit is a little fumbly. I often forget where I need to touch it to lower and increase volume. I’ve found my Apple Watch allows me to change the volume easily, but those without an Apple Watch may have a harder time using the unit. If you push too long, you could shut the whole thing off, when trying to adjust the volume, that’s annoying too. When I wear a mask at work, I get a little pain on the top of my ear, but that’s it. Not bad enough to take them off, just annoying. I love these headphones, they are my new favorite.<br /><br />One more thing! Rap and R&b sound sub par on these head phones. The bass also vibrates in the front unit ear pieces and it’s annoying. I love rap and RnB but can’t listen to many songs on these headphones. But that’s okay, listening to indie, rock and roll, and classical are all excellent listening experiences. I just avoid any seriously bassey music when I wear them, most music sounds okay. But that bass man, it will vibrate the ear pieces and tickles lol.  Can be come really offensive when you’re trying to forget they’re in your head.",[],B09BW2P5HQ,B09F5N95V9,AF447BY4DI2FNJYTTL47T4WDQC6Q,2023-01-02 17:38:33.357,0,False,509
691858,5,"Very good sound, good noise cancelling on phone/mic- great for all around use","These headphones are, for me, a great all around solution.<br /><br />The noise cancelling on the mic is superb.  The background noises don't make it to my phone calls, thank goodness.  Receiving or making outgoing calls, I can count on them to keep things clear, and I can hear the other side perfectly well- even though one of my ears isn't up to original specs, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />The connectivity is great, via bluetooth, usb, or the dongle they provide.  The dongle is simply a USB bluetooth LE device, adding bluetooth if you need it to connect.  I do have one laptop in my stable that doesn't have bluetooth built in- and I'm glad this dongle serves that purpose well.<br /><br />I tried this headset every way I could think of- and in the process, once I ended in a state where the bluetooth light was on whether I had the headset on OR off, and I couldn't connect.  I couldn't see any way to ""reset"" in the instructions- but gave it my best guess.<br /><br />Pushing both volume buttons up and down and the pairing button (three buttons) all at the same time reset the headset nicely.  I didn't see that in the documentation, but when you've used as many different headsets as I have, it made sense that Nuroum would include a reset feature- and they did, which is consistent with the level of quality I've felt from this set.<br /><br />Some folk might not like that the earpieces rest against the ear, but I am quite happy with it.  It's comfortable, doesn't distract from the sound, and keeps you _just enough_ in touch with your surroundings.  When I wear full over the ear muffs, I'm likely not to hear I'm being called from the next room.  I've gotten some soreness from full muffs at times- I wore these three hours straight, and they were still cozy enough to forget.  That's good by me.<br /><br />So, easy to use, easy to connect, dongle in case you don't have bluetooth on a PC.  Comfortable, great sound, and clear calls both ways.  Good for multimedia and music.  I couldn't want any more than that.  Definitely recommended.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615KGrHGHIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615KGrHGHIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615KGrHGHIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61AfQt17GWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61AfQt17GWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61AfQt17GWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61D-otwpbWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61D-otwpbWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61D-otwpbWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71m7jRUNenL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71m7jRUNenL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71m7jRUNenL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71o+gGME-+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71o+gGME-+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71o+gGME-+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BS6RZ5LG,B0C53MB1DX,AHWXSKTHRK2T37A2SWHRZMMURTZA,2023-03-19 02:40:29.451,0,False,509
131756,5,Loudest Alarm I’ve Heard Yet - Delivers 100% of Promise,"These door/window sensor alarms are a bit different from similar alarms that I’ve purchased in the past…<br />▪️First, they are black (black makes things disappear against darker backgrounds).<br />▪️Second, these alarms seem to be much louder than what I’m used to. My ears hurt for awhile after activating the alarm warble - test/install these with ear plugs in.<br />▪️Third, there are “activated” tones that indicate that a selection has been made: a high-pitched squeak, and the green light flashes. I noticed that it doesn’t always squeak or flash when setting alarm or chime.<br />▪️Forth, when the description says that the chime sounds twice, that’s what it means… not just “ding, dong” as with other sensors (that’s what I call “sounding twice”), instead it’s “ding, dong, ding, dong” (sounding four times in my book).<br />▪️Fifth, the chime is equally as loud as the alarm warble. It may be the volume, but the chime is just plain unpleasant - not the nice store chime announcing an incoming shopper. My cat was super displeased with both, screeching every time I set off either sound.<br />▪️Sixth, these sensors are way more sensitive to misalignment. They seem to be much quicker to sound when the two parts aren’t lined up perfectly. Be absolutely sure of their placement before affixing to a surface - use some painter’s tape to do a dry run.<br /><br />I’m not thrilled that the battery compartment cover is screwed down… usually those kinds of compartment covers are hard enough to get off just as they are. The small screw, and tiny print in weak white print for setting labels are going to force me to mount these lower on a door or window than I normally would.<br /><br />Now, will either the alarm warble or the chime alert a homeowner to a “guest”? Very definitely! These sensors deliver 100% of what they promise!

778542,5,"It my first set of these, won’t be my last","I bought these - or something very much like them - several years ago, and I had to get new ones just because over the years, whatever they were attached to had been thrown away or sold or moved in some way, but these are a fantastic way to both organize your cables, and help keep them hidden where they ordinarily would stick out like a sore thumb.<br /><br />It’s a large pack, and a couple of the organizers probably don’t have much utility, I think two of them hold like five cables each, all very close together, which, personally, I cannot find a use for, although the singles, doubles, etc., which are more practical, I’ve used several and I’ve got several left, so this pack should set you up for a good long while.<br /><br />The adhesive is exactly as I remembered it, it comes already stuck to the rubber piece, and you just have to clean the surface you’re about to place it on, peel back some wax paper and stick it on - and these things stay stuck, as long as the surface is dry, you will not have an issue with these falling off, or shifting or drooping.<br /><br />Yet, they remove very easily, and factoring in how well put they stay, that impresses me. They don’t leave residue on hard surfaces - though watch out using it on light particle board, and what residue they do leave behind on the organizer itself, usually rubbing your thumb back-and-forth a little bit will help peel it right off, and then you could find some other adhesive and use it again if you want.<br /><br />If you have a lot of cables that either jut out from behind desks, or don’t look that neat plugged in near your living room end table, whatever - there are a ton of uses for these. In this pack, even though a couple are may be impractical, is large enough that, unless you have a whole slew of cables you’re trying to manage, it will last you a good long time.<br /><br />You might run into some issues when one is designed to fit three cables, and the cables you’re fitting in there are sort of thick, but if you put them in the channels strategically in the correct order, you can pretty much work around that problem.<br /><br /> I would recommend these.",[],B071FXZBMV,B071FXZBMV,AFMLZYBI5JVR565KIIY7QPYRMRUQ,2023-01-23 11:44:18.798,6,True,508
291858,5,Awesome Monitor That Has Worked Well For Years,"I'm a huge fan of this monitor!

642701,4,It's okay.,"This is priced annoyingly linear with the product quality, so it's hard value this above or below other competitors. For +$100, you can get a full-NDI magewell. And second-hand could be an even more economical solution. So yeah, just keep it in mind.<br /><br />Some thoughts.<br />I was hoping this encoder's lesser NDI HX1/2 encoding bitrate (50Mb/s max) would be acceptable for A-camera transmission, but it's ultimately not, unfortunately. Probably fine for B-camera. For A-camera-quality video encoding, look to full NDI (+100Mb/s), from something like Magewell/Birddog/Haivision.<br /><br />The image quality from the encoder is ehh. Image quality would change when the thermals raised, so I put a 40mm blower fan on it, and that stabilized it. I stuck with 50Mb/s CBR@1s. VBR was as expected; fine when the image was nearly-static, but then shockingly blocky pixelation upon change. I don't remember what ABR resulted with, but I remember specifically not using it. (sorry) CQP/CRF seemed to add latency and dropped frames right around level 18 when it started looking better, so I avoided it using it. It did look decent though, but with the risk of inconsistent frames.<br /><br />By the way, if you want inexpensive but high-quality NDI encoding and have tons of space and don't mind a little Frankensteining, you might could just use an old computer with a GPU/fast-CPU paired with a HDMI capture device. I did this in a pinch, and it was surprisingly acceptable. HDMI->Capture device->into OBS->out using NDI. With tweaked settings, you can get under 5fps frame-buffer. Magewell capture devices (about $80) are USB UVC and can capture at about 1.5 frame latency. My Elgato capture devices appear in software as NDI devices, and was ok in latency, like 2-4 frame delay. Maybe a computer can bridge the internal NDI device directly to the LAN network at lower latency? idk, maybe test this idea if you're in this boat.<br /><br />I still have this device, so I can answer more questions if needed.",[],B089N6LRFN,B089N6LRFN,AFT57JMAOCRVEE4XHUBDV2AC2D7A,2023-01-16 09:00:15.250,0,True,508

That means, the maximum number of rows of pixels is 480 and the max number of columns is 800.<br /><br />When you first boot it, and focus it, the pixels are pretty chunky.<br /><br />But the nice thing is that the focus works really well. Compared to other cheap projectors, I was able to get a perfect focus on this device. Most of the time, the corners will blur or one side will blur while the other is focused. I was able to clear focus for all the pixels here.<br /><br />While the resolution is pretty low, when video is in motion it's surprisingly clear. Don't expect some super HD home-theatre experience. This _wont_ be it.<br /><br />However, for it's limitations, it's surprisingly good.<br /><br />The other thing I was expecting was to turn off all the lights in my apartment, so I could see it.<br /><br />But this thing is also shockingly bright!<br /><br />In the photos I attached to my post, I didn't turn off the lights in my room, and you can see the picture very clearly.<br /><br />With the lights fully off, this thing is more than serviceable, with great contrast.<br /><br />LED based mini-projectors have come far since the last time I tried them.<br /><br />Finally, I also threw some ancient AVI files and more modern MP4s at it and it was able to decode all of them just fine.<br /><br />OVERALL I am shocked that projector tech has come this far.

543772,4,Good Value In Small Package,"Let me start by saying I think this is a very nice little MP3 player.  For the price, one gets a lot to like.  It has all the bells and whistles that usually require spending much more.  Some of those features are overkill, since I can't imagine having the patience to watch videos or scroll through photos on a screen that is even smaller than the one on my cell phone, but, in an emergency, I can see the utility of having those functions available.  The FM radio and voice recorder are more useful, but, for me, the important feature is as an MP3 player.<br /><br />What makes this player a bit different than some others I have seen is that it does not have its own on-board memory.  It comes with a MicroSD card onto which one transfers music or other media.  The card pops out and can be replaced with a larger MicroSD card if desired.  As it happens, I have some music on MicroSD cards which I use in my car and on a Bluetooth speaker. When this player arrived I just switched in one of my cards and they worked perfectly. This is a feature I like, since I can transfer music on my computer to the MicroSD card and then just pop it into this player without messing with any cords, etc.  I also find it easier to manipulate the music on my computer, rather than on the little device/screen.<br /><br />If I have a complaint about this little guy, it is the non-intuitive, quirky interface.  I have had a number of MP3 players over the years and sort of know my way around them.  Nevertheless, the interface on this one had me flummoxed a bit, and I really had to play around with it to figure out how to do very basic things. About four buttons perform all the functions, but sometimes not the function you expect.  The play/pause button, particularly, does a lot more work than one would assume.  The power on/off switch is also very tiny and a bit stiff to turn on and off, but even when it is left on, it does not drain the battery too much, if the ""off"" button on the player is used. All of this having been said, however, once one figures it out, the player works pretty well and has good battery life.

My wifes' Dell doesn't have an SD-Card port.  It doesn't have an Ethernet port.  It doesn't have a Display Port .  It has only 2 USB-A ports and 1 USB-C port, and 1 HDMI.  She runs a 3-monitor setup using multiple video output adaptors.  Its a cluttered solution with too many points of failure because of loose connections, which happens enough to be distracting;  bump a cord and a monitor disconnects.  This docking station covers all those deficiencies.  This device is lightweight but solid.  The enclosure finish is a very nice, matte micro-textured Space Grey color (it looks Aluminum).  I intend to put a grippy cushion tab on the bottom of the device, whichever ""side"" I decide to use.  This is a nice design, with all the ports along the outer edge.  So up or down is decided by your cord management situation.  The ports are logically, generously spaced, so even the bulkiest HDMI cable will fit next to a Display Port cable  On the USB side of the device, all 4 ports are 3/8"" apart.  I would prefer 1/2"" or more.  All ports feel tight and secured.  The build quality of this adaptor is real quality.  The master output USB-C cable has<br /> a tight-braided sleeve that is semi-ridgid, in a good way.  It is a generous 19"" in length.<br /><br />  Look at the scrolling Product image gallery.  The images convey the impressive features in a well-designed format.  Every section of the scrolling presentation describes everything you need to know about this Docking Station.  Well done Fairikabe Store.  I admire the attention to detail this seller commits to.  It really reflects a trust in the quality of their products.  There really is not much more for me to say about this device that isn't already nicely described on their Amazon product page.  I didn't mean to turn this review into a user interface overview. I'm just very impressed by the presentation.  Well written.  Clean graphic design (my old profession) and it all works very well to sell a product.  It sold me.

101533,3,"Convenient, but horrible sleep mode issue","I bought this along with the M720 mouse to have a wireless combo that would take up less space on my desk and use only one wireless USB dongle. The connectivity works generally fine, and while installing multiple pieces of software just to make a mouse and keyboard work was annoying, I was happy for the first few days of using this combo. The mouse has a more troublesome lag issue overall, as it will just randomly be unresponsive, miss clicks, or jerk around the screen with regular use. While the M780 keyboard does better with normal operation, it apparently has a sleep function that has caused me some serious problems. Specifically, if you don't use the keyboard for a time, it will go to sleep, but there is no obvious signal that this has happened. I haven't noticed a light change on the keyboard, there is no onscreen notification, it just happens after the keyboard is idle for a time. Pressing a couple keys will wake it up, but you have to give it some time to fully reconnect. Again, there is no signal for when this has been achieved. Once the connection is established, it works fine again. However, during this process of waking up, if you don't realize what is happening or you don't give it enough time before you start typing, it will not just ignore all your keypresses, instead the keyboard will let some through, ignore some, and multiply some of your keypresses in an endless loop. For example, a single press of the D key will come out as ""DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD"" until overridden. For normal typing, this is a small inconvenience, but if you are using productivity software or using the keyboard do enter shortcut commands, and your keypress is to delete an item or use some other single key shortcut, that will similarly get multiplied. As a result, this has resulted in me accidentally deleting files or seriously messing up settings in programs when I didn't realize the keyboard had fallen asleep. I'm not giving this a full negative review because aside from this sleep issue, the keyboard is fine (I'm less happy with the mouse), but the issue would be less of a problem if there was just some better signal for this sleep mode and for when the keyboard is successfully connected, because there's no way I have found to know until you start typing if it is ready to work. If you're ok dealing with this idiosyncrasy of the keyboard, I can recommend it. Otherwise, look elsewhere.",[],B01LZTBKBG,B01LZTBKBG,AFT6S6OYRGAJ6YDKB4KXVAYWX4WQ,2023-01-25 01:44:49.937,0,True,508
46032,4,"Great controls, okay sound, do not stay in my ears very well.","I've tried a lot of these wireless earbuds including a couple of other SoundPeats. I've generally been very happy with the SoundPeats brand. That said, I didn't really care for these all that much. However, the things that I disliked were mostly about the basic type of earbuds these are.<br /><br />They don't fit into the ear canal like ordinary earbuds do, rather, they just kind of rest in the outer ear. This makes them very comfortable, but it also means that they aren't as loud as ordinary earbuds, they also don't block outside noises very well and worst of all they tend to fall out on occasion. If I'm just wearing these while sitting on the couch or going for a walk in a quiet location, they are fine. I do hear outside noises though, which may be good depending on the circumstances but in most cases I would prefer not to. They also tended to fall out of my ears when bending over. This makes them not so great for working out or cleaning the toilet.<br /><br />Bluetooth connection and reconnection was quick and reliable. Range was about the same as other earbuds. Battery life was a little less, so expect about 2.5 to 3 hours.<br /><br />The control scheme is excellent. Everything that I want to be able to do, including volume control and fast forward and rewind, is available. The touch controls are very sensitive which is mostly good but due to the shape of the bud I wound up adjusting the volume or pausing playback when I was just trying to reset the bud in my ear. One nifty little feature is that when a single bud is removed from the ear, the playback pauses. This is great for when I want to talk to someone briefly.<br /><br />Playback latency is very good, and I didn't notice any delay on videos or while gaming. There is a dedicated gaming mode which is supposed to reduce the latency, but I didn't notice any change in my testing. During a phone call, I would hear the other side perfectly well and they told me the same.<br /><br />I only recommend these earbuds if you are looking for something a little more comfortable than ordinary earbuds that you are only planning on using in relatively quiet environments while performing relatively sedentary activities. Otherwise, I would recommend a more traditional style of earbud in the SoundPeats brand.",[],B0BRCZY1Z1,B0BQTKVGS8,AH75A6UQWHO7YRX3YZG2IIVB5HHQ,2023-02-21 21:21:28.941,0,False,508
707268,3,The Search Continues,"Okay, yes, I have unusual needs in a keyboard. I write for a living, so my keyboard is important. I prefer keyboards with short travel keys—I hate those trendy mechanical keyboards everyone raves about (there, I said it).<br /><br />The gold standard for me so far has been the Logitech MX-Keys, which is basically everything I want in a keyboard except one thing: it's wireless only. It comes with a USB cable, but it's only for charging. I like wired keyboards; the wireless kind always run out of battery at the worst possible time, plus I have a USB switch to switch my keyboard and mouse between computers.<br /><br />If there were an MX Keys that worked in wired mode, I could die happy. As it is, there isn't, so I have been on the search for a new wired keyboard. Macally makes a keyboard that's almost perfect, except there's a design flaw in the spacebar--it dosn't always register if you hit the edge of the spacebar, and I type fast. Missed spaces screw up my rhythm.<br /><br />This keyboard has a feel almost identical to the Macally. And if it were otherwise as good, I'd give it five stars in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Alas, while it looks like metal, the body is plastic--and a very soft plastic at that. When I got this keyboard, the body was so soft it bowed slightly in the center. Not a lot—less than a millimeter—but it was quite noticeable. Hitting keys in the middle of the keyboard causes the whole keyboard to bounce up and down.<br /><br />Other than that, it's great. Bluetooth plus wired, you can pair it to three computers at once (not that I do; I keep it plugged in all the time), and it even comes with a nice silicone keyboard cover.<br /><br />But the bow in the plastic body shows an inattention to design. I fixed it with several layers of masking tape, as you can see in the second photo, which made it perfectly adequate (and better than the Macally keyboard, since the spacebar is more reliable)...but it's still not perfect. And so the quest continues.<br /><br />Oh, Logitech, why won't you give us a wired MX Keys? You have everything right there! You're so close to perfect!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NB8jivo0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NB8jivo0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NB8jivo0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wcTy-zf2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wcTy-zf2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wcTy-zf2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BL34NLV8,B0C77T74K6,AG4OYCEXNCKZNM3CTW3JZIV5LSEA,2023-01-03 18:02:54.329,0,False,508
356639,5,"Works for an LG 43"" 4K monitor!","I am using a standing desk convertor on top of my desk and the weight of my monitor (LG 43un700-b) is 38 lbs if you include the weighted base, so that was too much for the motor in the standing desk convertor. You could hear an audible groan as it struggled under the weight and I wanted a bit more room on the surface anyway.<br /><br />There are a lot of items to research when you're looking for monitor stands on Amazon and after literally two days of hypothesizing the best new set up (monitor arm mounted onto the standing desk convertor? floor stand behind the desk? articulating arm? non-articulating arm?), I decided on this one.<br /><br />I really didn't ""need"" any articulation, but this was a good deal and included the feature. To ensure it was safer, I added some metal plates (also sold on Amazon) to reinforce the Ikea desk.<br /><br />Putting the base and pole together were easy, but I wish there was an easier mounting system (similar to some flat-panel TV mounts) where you mount the VESA plate first, then hook it onto the arm, then secure it with bolts.<br /><br />In the end, I used the standing desk to help support the monitor at the proper height while fighting with the VESA mount. This monitor has a 200x200mm mount but requires spacers since the plate won't fit entirely into the ""cavity"" that's at the back of the monitor. If you look closely at this specific monitor, you'll see some plastic ridges that help keep their original mount in place and they interfere with this plate. No big deal, but I will note that one of the spacers snapped, so I will be replacing that.<br /><br />Regardless, the monitor is holding steady and I've checked the bolts underneath for the first few days/week after mounting it. There doesn't seem to be any give or wobble.<br /><br />Now, I've got my desk space back and it's mounted just a big higher than it was sitting before. That way it's about the right height whether I'm sitting or standing.<br /><br />Overall this is a 4.5 out of 5 for the great value, sturdy arm, but the installation/mounting could be easier. Especially for someone trying to mount a monitor larger than 32"" by themselves!",[],B0BRDBW2V7,B0BRDBW2V7,AHXITZ4PHFUMPTYG3EYPADOG4DKA,2023-02-26 21:06:03.610,1,True,508
328532,5,"Quality, well built lamp that gets the job done.","TLDR;<br />- Great product that does what it says it will.<br />- Well built, feels heavy and premium.<br />- Causes some glare on glossy objects on my desk.<br />- Buy it now before the price increases if you're shopping for one of these lamps.<br /><br />This light bar does the job; one of those things you didn't know you needed until you got it. It cost $40 instead of $200. The build quality is excellent. The lamp is aluminum with touch controls and a light sensor. The mount is a sturdy plastic. The unit feels solid and well-built, heavy even.<br /><br />The controls and light sensor mean I don't need a hockey puck or awkward cable controls on my desk. I'm grateful for that because I dislike the clutter of those options. My webcam mounts on top of the lamp in the center. So, there was no problem there.<br /><br />The only downsides I have encountered are slight flickering and a few glares. The lamp will sometimes flicker while I'm at my desk. It's slight but annoying. The flicker is subtle. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me at first. Not a deal breaker at all, of course.<br /><br />As for the glare, well, there's not much of a glare on the screen (Asus ProArt 32). It's very slight but noticeable. Again, not a deal breaker. If anything, it showed me I needed to dust my screen off. The glare on my iPad screen while I draw or on books with glossy pages is real and causes me to reposition them.<br /><br />There are no shadows from my head or hand as there would be with my overhead light or a desk lamp. But the light source is so close and bright, even on lower settings, to glare on glossy things. This is alright, of course. It doesn't get in the way of reading, and the iPad screen gets brighter, but it's something to know. You'll be fine if you use regular paper, a moleskin, or something. If you don't use paper or books in your day-to-day work, this lamp will cause no problems.<br /><br />In conclusion, I'd rebuy it. It's a solid lamp and does what it says. It's worth the $40.

407381,5,QUIT SEARCHING NOW! THIS IS THE ONE!,"100% sincere review.<br />If you're anything like me, buying a cheap smartwatch is difficult.<br />You have a lot of options, but you don't want to buy a subpar watch. I seek affordable rates and high quality. Then It's done!<br />Every time I purchase something from Amazon, I'm let down because I didn't truly know what I was getting until I receive it in the mail. Images of sellers are not particularly useful because some sellers slant their watches, making it impossible to determine whether they are good watches. I bought a watch few years back, it was fantastic in the images, but when it actually arrived, I was shocked. It was enormous and like a redneck's circular cigarette box. The battery only lasts him a day, and there aren't many features. I now take great care while purchasing a new smartwatch.<br /><br />I bought another just before buying this one. I made the decision to return it and purchase this watch instead because this smartwatch costs the same and has much more functions. Let me just say that this watch totally blew me away. This watch is extremely fantastic. For health concerns, I was looking for a specific feature. The one I gave back had a heart rate monitor, but my mind was elsewhere. I noticed this watch at that time. It costs the same and has practically all the features you require. Check your blood pressure, blood oxygen level, and heart rate. All three characteristics can be easily found in a single watch, but they will cost double or treble the price. Add to that all the other features this provides. The cost is unbeatable!<br />The screen looks great, the response time is excellent, and the battery life is as stated. This watch isn't as big and bulky as most. (Duration may vary according on usage.) It includes every amenity needed for an active lifestyle. Also included is a sleep monitor! I urge you to test out this watch. As I read some of the evaluations of several smartwatches, I notice that several customers have expressed dissatisfaction with other watch's build quality and the functionality of certain watch’s capabilities, but I can promise you that it is not. All the features of this smartwatch function flawlessly with my high-end IPhone . So, if you want an excellent smartwatch but have a tight budget, start with this one.

The fans were showing 0rpm. I went through a host of configurations with the fans using the provided fan splitter, no splitter, one fan, both fans, every possible combination. Some times I could boot to windows but, was met with and unstable system/crash every time.. Sometimes I was met with the CPU fan error message. I finally put one of my old fans on the cooler and plugged directly into the CPU fan connector on the MB. Booted up into windows and started Prime95. Every thing now runs as it should. However. if I plug either of the provided fans into the CPU connector I end up with a CPU FAN error or an unstable system that crashed. The fans appear to randomly stop working resulting in high temps or they fans just stop reporting to the system causing the system to freak out and then crash.<br /><br />With my fans on the cooler the cooler performs well keeping my temps at of below the 70c threshold.

887257,4,"Huge, great for outside, but some reservations","I am having a difficult time rating this one.  When I started to write it up I was somewhat negative.  And that's because while writing this review, I reread the instruction sheet and noticed for the first time the mention of a YouTube channel. I found the video - LEABIOLT Direct and It changed my mind - somewhat.<br />My wife and I had a hard time assembling the frame by following the enclosed instruction sheet. We got so frustrated we broke for lunch and then finished assembly. Then I discovered the video and  watched and listened carefully comparing what he did with what we did.  And just after he slipped the rods into the pockets on the screen fabric edges, he changed the sequence  of steps, pointing out that his sequence of connecting the corners was ""a lot easier.""  That was quite an understatement.<br /> We had one other difficulty.  Two parts which should have been identical had a slight difference.  The vertical sections on the two lower legs (#5) were not equal in length - one is too short and the 'bullet catch' was off by about a quarter inch.  As a result it wouldn't catch on the 'stub' tube of its #4 mate.  This results in the feet being free to rotate making the screen unstable.  Not a giant killer, but it is a technical foul.<br /> Projected image is fine if you are in a dark environment and have an appropriate projector.  Later this year I may take it to my brother's backyard.  He has a deck, and I will try mounting it on a bench with the stub legs lashed to the railing.  The guests will be scattered around the lawn. I will see if it works well with rear-projection.<br />PRO: It is large.  Yet fits in the provided duffle bag.  I will guess that by using the YouTube sequence to assemble with practice it might take 20 minutes to assemble.  The elastic on the rod pockets will remove any wrinkles in the fabric.  It can be used outside.<br />CON: Instruction sheet was lacking or out-of date.  It appears that there was an inconsistency on one part with resultant foot alignment problem.

Mainly cause I don't have any such devices and they are really expensive!<br /><br />I used an AC power meter to compare power consumption in these 3 cases:<br />1. using the TB4 Hub's power brick sending power to the laptop thru the Hub;<br />2. Using Apple's 60W power adapter direct to the laptop's Thunderbolt/USB-C port.<br />The difference is about 5W more or less with the TB4 Hub way consuming more. So the Hub itself really doesn't consume that much power.<br />3. An Anker USB-C w HDMI hub that I have consumes about 3W more then direct Apple AC Adapter<br />So the TB4 hub doesn't consume much more in this simple scenario.<br /><br />Go for ThunderBolt 4 mainly because:<br />a. it doesn't seem to have the wake up the Mac problem that's sometimes reported with ThunderBolt 3 Hubs<br />b. it's more future proof and doesn't cost much more<br /><br />Note: Thunderbolt accessories are really expensive mainly cause the bandwidth is very high at 40Gbps. USB-C accessories work fine with this TB4 hub. You can even attach a USB-C Hub to one of the TB4 ports as and when needed e.g. for SD card reader etc.<br /><br />I needed to go this route because my laptop only supports DisplayPort 1.2. There are many cheaper USB-C hubs that can do 4K60Hz too. But they assume you have a DisplayPort 1.4 capable laptop. Otherwise it gets limited to 4K30Hz.,[],B09NQPVZF3,B09NQPVZF3,AGHKREZH5ZAL37AF5C77Y7VQGPCQ,2023-02-07 05:38:46.434,1,True,508
67307,3,"Outdated software, no means to change animations and lacks options.","I don’t love it. This seems overpriced for what you get. For the price, I was expecting it to look more like a photo frame but instead, it kinda feels like an old monitor. My goal was to hang it on the wall during art shows with process videos playing. It will work OK for that but I’m disappointed that unless the video is in the exact proportion of the frame, it will always look a little “off” and there’s no means of changing how it’s framed in the display.<br /><br />I think it’s at its best without the clock or any other additions.<br /><br />The pros: It really does work right out of the box. It only took minutes to get photos onto it. The big screen is nice, I can see details in my photos. It is also bright with vivid colors. I like that it is flat which is why it performs better than an average monitor as a picture frame. The simple black frame doesn’t detract from its appearance. I like that there is an app and my husband and I were able to add photos, and I also like that there is a way to add photos via card in case software changes make the app obsolete. With the app, I was able to get videos onto it in minutes. I also like that it has a large amount of storage space and the means to expand it..<br /><br />The cons: It is slow. I didn’t love the way the photos are displayed. I also hate the default animations because they are a bit cheesy. I want it to fade or some other non-intrusive way to change photos, and there is no means to edit it. The features are incredibly barebones. I hate that the default includes the time etc, I just want it to look like a photo frame!  The audio is a bit tinny, much more so than a television etc. I also find it bizarre in 2023 to have an item that warns that it can destroy a USB if it’s removed without turning it off first…that seems like such an old-school problem!<br /><br />I wish the plug was white because the black looks bad against the wall, and I prefer a minimalist look.<br /><br />For the price, I feel like this could be better. There are just so few options for customizing the display.",[],B0BR7TVS9X,B0BZSYPRRH,AHD7IMCL7JGT2VPAJDMINO5YJI3A,2023-03-08 06:44:13.893,0,False,508
804564,5,"Mid-size backpack/travel bag that’s flight approved, water resistant, and built to last!","[[VIDEOID:a32d675762d7bc5a3cbe3bb551b6fc19]] This mid-size bag packs a lot features in a compact size. The material has a subtle, rubberized look and feel to it, which is probably why it’s described as being water-resistant.<br /><br />The front, back, and shoulder straps are well-padded for protection and comfort. All the zippers in this backpack have a protective seal to prevent water entry.<br /><br />Designed for work, school/college, or light travel, the bag has three main sections. Here are several features I really like:<br />• The rear, dual-zip section opens on three sides for full access. There’s a padded divider with a Velcro-close flap. This flap has an open slip pocket you could use for USB sticks or earpods. There’s also a large slip pocket for files and folders.<br />• The middle section has dual-zippers and is expandable to 4” deep. It’s ideal for packing clothing, shoes, and outerwear. Inside, there’s a netted zip-close flap that secures your belongings and a side zipper pocket for small-ish items. There’s also a USB port/cord in this section.<br />• The front, dual-zip section has an open pocket on one side, and five open and one zip pocket on the other. There’s also a detachable key ring.<br /><br />I also like the horizontal zipper pocket located on the front of the pack – for those items I need quick access to, like credit cards, ID, cash, etc.<br /><br />The back is made of a ventilated mesh material. There’s a horizontal strap to slip the pack over an extended luggage handle for travel. There’s also a zippered pocket on one of the shoulder straps. It’s pretty small, but it’s a good place to stash quick cash, lip balm, or other small items.<br /><br />Overall, I like the flexibility and design of the bag. It's not only great-looking, it’s flight approved, water resistant, compact, and is built to last. I’m looking forward to road-testing it on my next business trip.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+qJrU2ARL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url':

772803,5,Wow!  High quality earbuds at a great price!!,"This might be the very best value in earbuds that I have come across (and I own AirPods).  I bought these for use at the gym.  I was looking for a high quality, sturdy, and easy to use earbuds for the gym.  This fits the bill and then some.  Here is what I love about these wireless earbuds:<br /><br />- sound is excellent, on par with the more expensive earbuds, but at a much lower affordable price.  I am a music junkie that uses earbuds on a daily basis, at work, at the gem, etc, so sound is most important to me.  This makes the grade and will not disappoint, from low range, mid-range, all the way up to live concert level!<br /><br />- battery life might be the best characteristic of this model.  With volume at mid-range, these airbus’s will last a long time.  I am in the gym for 2.5 to 3 hours per session.  So far, I have not had to recharge after using these for 2 plus sessions.  I will not be surprised if it lasts through my third session this week.  You will definitely be pleased with not only the long charge life, but it provides great options for recharging them, through your phone, wirelessly (which I love via the case that comes with it), or just through the charged case itself.  Love this flexibility.<br /><br />- the fit is very secure, yet comfortable, on the ear.  My sessions at the gym include cardio (treadmill, elliptical, bike, arc trainer),  weightlifting, as well as outdoor running.  No issues doing it all.  Perfect for these activities.<br /><br />- the range on these earbuds is superb.  You can walk away from your phone or mp3 player and not lose connection or get connection static feedback.  When connected to my iPhone,  I walk approximately 100 feet away and it had zero impact on sound quality.<br /><br />What I dislike:<br /><br />Nothing yet.  For the money, you can’t get a better pair of earbuds as far as I am concerned (and I’ve gone through various models at different price ranges.  This is a “can’t miss”.",[],B0BNT6J4B3,B0C3ZQ7KHJ,AGJPW44EVTTYSXPN2J6PARKDEDHA,2023-03-01 01:00:44.585,6,True,508

868069,2,Won't use it.,"I was using this case on my Galaxy Tab S8+.<br /><br />I'll get straight to the point:<br /><br />1.  It's almost impossible to separate the two pieces (top/bottom covers).  You have to pry them apart with your finger nails.  (hopefully you don't rip out your fingernail).  - you have been warned.<br /><br />2.  The top cover fits around your tablet, but it is very tight.  I was afraid that I would scratch the sides of the tablet.  There is no soft liner on the inside of that top cover.<br /><br />3.  Once your tablet is inside that top cover, the next journey is to insert that top half inside the bottom half cover.  This was a huge struggle because it is such a tight fit.  I had to push/stretch out the side edges of the bottom half so that the top half would fit more easily into the bottom half.<br /><br />4.  There is no hole in the protective screen cover for the fingerprint reader.  It now takes me four-five attempts for my tablet to read my fingerprint.<br /><br />5.  In portrait mode, the case will fall over if you tap/bump either of the top corners.  - wow!!.<br /><br />6.  Taking apart this case (while the tablet is installed) is another journey,  - very difficult.<br /><br />7.  The kickstand compartment (~3x4 inches) extends too high inside the bottom cover.  Thus, your tablet sits on top of that small area.  The remainder of your tablet surfaces does not sit on anything.  (air gap).<br /><br />On the positive side:<br /><br />1.  Very sturdy case.<br />2.  Screen cover will protect your tablet screen from scratches.<br />3.  Finger swiping seems to work ok.  - I did not even bother to test with the S-Pen.<br />4.  No magnets on the kickstand.  This is good because kickstand magnets are known to interfere with the tablet electronics.<br /><br />Overall, I spent way too much time/effort just getting my S8+ tablet installed in this case.

85690,3,Longtime User,"I've been using these almost every day for over a year now. I've had good experiences and bad experiences with them.<br /><br />One bad experience is that the entire plastic circle on the outer part of the right earphone switches modes if you press it. That seems like it would be a good thing, but in reality, when I use these while lying down I am constantly hitting that button by accident if I move my head or roll onto my side. Ironically, I find that if I am trying to press that big button using my hand, the button  almost never works. Another irony is that I never use the other two modes (normal and transparency) so it would be better for me if that button didn't even exist.<br /><br />The second bad experience is that when the headphones are not connected to anything by bluetooth they turn themselves off after an hour. I often wear them just for the noise cancelling in loud spaces, without listening to music or anything. I find this very annoying.<br /><br />The third bad experience is that they have never worked for making or receiving calls. I have to scramble to turn off bluetooth when someone calls me so I can use my phone's built-in microphone and speaker.<br /><br />The fourth bad experience is that the five buttons around the rims of the earphones all feel the same when I touch them. When the headphones were new to me I constantly struggled to push the right button, especially the power button. Even now, after using them for over a year, I still feel unsure and I have to run my thumb along the rim of the earphone, feeling for the rectangular hole of the usb input. The on/off button is the one closest to that hole.<br /><br />One good experience is that the battery seems to last a long time, especially if I'm not listening to music or anything. The battery also seems to charge quickly.<br /><br />A second good experience is that when I am listening to music or an audiobook or whatever, I really like the quality of the sound. I find it clear, loud enough, and balanced between bass and treble.<br /><br />A third good experience is that I feel like the price equals the benefits I get from the headphones.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not unhappy with them but I probably wouldn't buy them again if I could find something better for around the same price.",[],B08HMWZBXC,B08VD2NX25,AFQCCRW2VQQXP346FY3WDFJTDAQA,2023-03-09 00:29:36.222,0,False,508
524567,5,Very good consumer level security camera,"I own two of these and use them with Blue Iris. The software integration is simple and has been very reliable. Streaming rate is adequate for 15 fps on both main and sub stream. Image quality is excellent during the day, and seems to be very good during the night, but that is deceptive: the clear static picture you see is achieved at the expense of massive smoothing of the pixelated image. This becomes apparent whenever anyone walks through the field of view at night, all you see is a ""comet"" with a blob for the face and a blurry tail. I tried to experiment with the amount of 3D and 2D smoothing that the web interface provides, but to achieve realistic motion capture in the dark I had to sacrifice image quality so much that the pixelation and digital noise made the image unusable anyway. Long exposure mode showed promise but I had to extend the exposure to the point of reaching the frame rate, and also had trouble having the camera switch between night and day mode. That resulted in the long exposure mode extending into daylight, saturating the sensor and whiting out the image. The IR illumination only seems to blur the image instead of making it better, so I turned it off. Note that the camera is not even in a particularly dark area, there are 4 garage night lights lighting up the driveway that it is looking at. So that is a little disappointing. But that said, my other brand of consumer camera that starts with R performs more or less the same in the dark, and much worse in all other aspects with Blue Iris, so I will not complain. But take the ""starlight"" label on the box with a grain of salt. You probably need a $700 camera for that to be true.<br />The second one I have looks at an area under a street light. That one is doing better at night, which makes me think that the IR from the street lamp helps it a lot (the garage lights are LED, so they probably are lacking in the IR range). So if you stick with these cameras, you may want to add a dedicated IR illuminator over the area it is looking at.<br />During daylight this camera is great. The mic works fine.<br />I wish it had field curvature correction in the firmware as the FOV is very distorted on the edges due to the wide angle. Alas, you don't get that at this price point.<br />Overall I like these cameras and recommend them to people using Blue Iris.",[],B07RHQGS8V,B07RHQGS8V,AFRHWJ2EZNUXIUSTGQN7WFITUXSA,2023-01-21 20:41:23.361,1,True,508
800026,5,Recycle old laptops,"Can I have a moment of silence for my dearly departed technology?<br /><br />Like many people, I had a stack of old laptops collecting dust in my closet -- did you know old batteries can explode? Mine didn't thankfully but someone recently warned me they could so I bit the bullet and decided to rip what I could off of my tech graveyard and send them to laptop heaven. Unfortunately two of my four dead laptops are dead dead and haven't worked in years. Enter this thing.<br /><br />I consider myself moderately tech literate so I wasn't too worried about being able to figure this out. The product listing has a guide if you get stuck but it's pretty intuitive. Remember if the device you are using to copy the drive to another drive has only USB-C you will need an adapter, this thingy has just a regular USB A (the flat rectangular one) connection.<br /><br />My 2011 MacBook Pro ripped beautifully, that was the one I thought would give me trouble but ended up being the easiest (thankfully by some miracle I remembered my password which I needed to unlock the volume). As did my 2010 Windows 7 laptop. For some reason my 2009 netbook (remember those??) did not spin up correctly when connected to this doohickey, luckily that one still worked so I was able to transfer files directly by booting it up. All of them utilized the same kind of connection -- power to the drive and then a wide connector to a cord that goes directly into the working device you'll use to copy files over.<br /><br />I had no problem using this device to copy files from my old laptops to an external drive using both my Chromebook and MacBook Air, the product connected to both just fine. It is no different than connecting a regular external drive as far as file management.<br /><br />Other reviewers suggested this product literally arrives on a slow boat from China, I did not have that issue, it took a few days more than Prime though as it came straight from the vendor via USPS. And yes, it does look janky. But it does the job!<br /><br />I can't say how this set would handle a large number of laptops but it worked just fine on my small one. Except the netbook of course but that thing was always a mess, I don't fault the device for that.

The TP Link is 50 to 100Mbps faster to my Wifi 5 clients and has better antenna coverage to my far clients in a dense wifi area.<br /><br />I almost bought a second UAP-IW-HD-US until I started reading around and saw the 615 is like half the cost, so I bought two. I wound up installing both 615's but it's probably overkill in my case. One 615 was connecting fine to clients that the UAP-IW-HD-US could not. The UAP-IW-HD-US's antenna coverage doesn't seem to be very good at the edges. I wonder if the metal trim on the cover has a negative impact. A lot of people like the Ubiquiti console but there isn't a compact low cost stand alone console like the Omada system offers. I haven't tried Omada cloud yet, but it looks more straight forward. I don't need Omada Cloud or controller yet as the standalone mode with the app and logging into the AP's IP works perfectly for me. I set one to 5G and the other to 2.4G.<br /><br />If I ever need a new wired router I will try the Omada model and the controller unless the cloud is free. Currently, I use an Ubiquiti ER-X 5 port router with the HW routing enabled and it's a great little router. After that I connect the TP-Link TL-SG2008P for my cat5 outlets and to power the 615's. I just pulled 390Mbps over the air to my 2015 MacBook Pro.<br /><br />The next .ax version of the Ubiquiti should be faster, but until then there are better options, and even then the price premium for Ubiquiti doesn't seem worth it unless you need that ecosystem. The 615 is fast and great for a home application like mine - love having no router around the house taking up space.<br /><br />Before this upgrade I had a Nest Wifi and it was fine. The Nest wound up devolving to a state where it would be so slow and it wouldn't recover without a power cycle or for many hours. I'm pretty amazed how much faster the TP link 615's are.",[],B09KYK1S9R,B0BZLD2L4Q,AFVUNRXECHBTXDGWF4DJKK3KIDTQ,2023-03-17 06:42:14.151,0,True,508

6057,5,This is the Koss set you're looking for.,"The KPH30i is darn near the perfect set of koss on ear headphones. I own/have owned the KPH30i, KSC75, KHP40, and Porta Pro's. The only two I kept/still own are the KPH30i's and the KSC75's.<br /><br />The Porta Pros are far too muddy and bassy. Instant return.<br /><br />The KPH40 are a little better as far as clarity goes, but still way too much bass that overpowers the mids and highs. If you like actual music, these are not enjoyable. Probably the most comfortable set, but a disappointment soundwise so they too we're returned.<br /><br />The KSC75 are the brightest of the bunch, but still not over the top shrill or anything. Mids are nice and present which help guitars cut through the mix if you're into heavy rock/metal/etc. I go back and forth between the KSC75 with the parts express headband and ear clips. Both sound great and are useful depending on your wearing needs. Ultimately I think I like the KSC75's more with the stock pads than the Yaxi pads. The Yaxi pads + the Parts Express headband are S tier comfort, but the Yaxi's smooth out the treble a bit much and it kind of takes away from the character of what makes the KSC75's enjoyable.<br /><br />The KPH30i is just right with the balance of bass, mids, and treble. (If they were just a bit brighter they'd be perfect. (If you EQ, you can always add it in). Great sound stage, again bass is just right, not overpowering like the others, mids sit very well and make everything just sound cohesive.<br /><br />Now the cons of the KPH30i. They are the least comfortable of the bunch unfortunately. The headband really doesn't have great swivel movement where the drivers attach. The pads are a bit scratchy/rough and unfortunately not easily swapped without popping drivers off/risking damage. The head band quality itself as many others have stated leaves a lot to be desired. Fairly weak plastic just waiting to snap.<br /><br />So honestly just buy the KPH30i's, they're the best sounding and the value is there. That's all, have a good day.",[],B07SFK2K17,B07PNK7Q7Q,AGIUS3FFPCT3QBKGU5VQJWX5YLBQ,2023-02-19 19:09:21.278,2,True,508
580146,1,"Huge, Overpriced, Buggy Albatross. Sent it back.","If you want a portable device to take with you anywhere and listen to your favorite music anywhere, in the highest quality, DON'T BUY THIS. It is huge. It is as long as a cell phone and as thick as an old skool cassette walkman. You can't throw it in your pants pockets along with your wallet and cell phone. It's TOO BIG! On top of that, for $400, you get a player that skips every time it changes tracks - skips at the very beginning of each track, and sometimes just randomly skips, as well. The sound quality is not even anything to write home about. It has very weak bass. I am using Beyerdynamic Dt  770 pros in 32 0hms  and the bass is very weak. I also have to turn any headphones I use with it up really loud for them to be loud enough, and none of them are high impedance headphones. I can use the same headphones on Fiio's M3K player (originally a $50 player, but discontinued now) and get great bass and volume. That's ridiculous.  This is unacceptable performance for a $400 device. I sent it back. If you want the most portable player ever, with great sound, for a great price, try Shanling's M0 Pro. I sent the M11s back and ordered the M0 pro instead. It's only $120, sounds great, is TINY for ultimate portability, and accepts up to a 2TB sd card. It has more bass than either the M3K or the M11s, and a nice, balanced sound overall. It's like a high fidelity Sansa Clip. Awesome. I wish I'd have seen it first, and I wish they would make it clear in the pics for the M11s how big it is. I wouldn't have ordered it. I considered keeping the device as just a home player and not using it for portable use, but the skipping and generally unimpressive audio performance made it not even worth keeping for that. I don't feel like anything about it is worth $400 besides that it is big and has a huge screen, but to me that's not a good thing, and nothing I need for listening to music. Unless Fiio starts making smaller/better quality players like the M3K again, I will not purchase any more of their products.

865528,1,"Dumbest ""Smart"" TV on the market will absolutely frustrate you, I guarantee it!","This TV is terrible. Every time I turn it on, I have to navigate to whatever is plugged into the dumb thing or try waiting 30seconds to a minute for it to finally detect that something is actually connected to it and fullscreen that device. This doesn't sound too bad but it will start playing it's bloatware/ads at me while entirely ignoring the device that I have connected. Sometimes it even starts playing god awful lifetime movies it calls ""samsung exclusives"" instead of doing what I want it to do. For the love of god, please just  connect to my PC.<br />My previous TV was SO much better even though it was a: 1080p, 60hz refresh rate, not ""smart"", Samsung tv. The picture quality is so washed out and dark compared to my old tv, I considered just going back to the lower definition and refresh rate.<br />This thing is a $2000 piece of garbage that I'm not willing to pay to ship back; plus I'm too afraid to even touch the thing because a stiff gust of wind could break it in two. It is thinner than my smart phone which probably sounds really cool! Let me remind you, that means there is no protection on the glass. I would warn against having any pets or children near it. It is quite literally a giant sheet of glass with delicate electronic parts peppered throughout. The smallest bump could send a crack across the whole television screen ruining an incredibly overpriced hunk of junk. Not to mention, the base on the stupid tv is so small it could easily be tipped over and shattered into a million pieces.<br />I had to be VERY careful taking it out of the box and setting it on its base because I live alone. The instructions say a two person carry is needed, holding the glass at specific points in order to not utterly destroy the flimsy tv. Instead of calling a friend/family member to waste 30 seconds of their life helping me, I decided to risk taking it out of the box myself. Everything went fine despite me holding my breath and nearly having a heart attack the two times I handled it. Me admitting this here probably voids some stupid warranty on it. Oh well. If at some point it stops working for me, I will just buy a cheaper version that isn't ""smart"", from a different brand and likely be happier with that other tv.

326333,5,Noob with BlueTooth Earbuds somewhat impressed with these EARBEANS!,"I have literally bought 5+ pair of Sennheiser MX-680 over the years, because they sound great, and work for my purposes with same situation Sansa Clip+ MP3 players (way more than 5+) for about 12 years. Both of those devices are rare now, and I am facing the fact that it's time to get into the modern era. I download about 25 podcasts on Sunday to listen to while I toil at my job all week. I have tested and returned several devices in the last month or so, but I have held on to these earbeans. If you have seen or own a set, you know why I refer to them as earbeans. They sound and/or fit better than 3 other wireless sets that I have tried. More consistent bluetooth connections with several devices, and may even sound better than the wired Sennheisers on my gaming laptop... They tend to work their way out of my ears gradually requiring me to push them back in a little after a couple hours, but it beats the alternative of having my ears clogged with silicone ear tips which I don't care for. Weirdest thing I have to complain about is that when I go outdoors, the bluetooth connection gets real flukey. I don't understand it, but when I am indoors or in a car, it's perfect. When I step outside, it's in and out (same with Raycons which I tested at the same time)... Finally, when paired with my Galaxy S8 (yes I am old and don't buy a new phone every year or less), I can't seem to get them loud enough, but I think that's the nanny nature of the phone not wanting to damage one's hearing and not so much the earbeans because they will go much louder on the PC... Take it from someone who will reject anything of questionable quality, these are good. Raycon on the other hand (at $55 more) - going back.<br /><br />Edit 04/14/2023: The inconsistent BlueTooth performance outdoors was not related to the earbeans, but the player I was using at the time. BlueTooth performance is great with my older Samsung phone (S8) which is holstered behind my right hip. I do have to push them down a few times per day for maximum performance, but that's a small price to pay for the sound quality that these provide.

990531,3,Pro Perspective... WEAK compared to other FF motors and non-existent customer service,"Quick Summary - Good reliable wireless range And feature rich. However, pulls can be jerky... read on for more.<br /><br />First of all, the instructions are terrible and you are basically left to figure out how to do everything yourself. Since SmallRig is expanding to everything video, you can make a safe assumption that they may just be overextending themselves a bit. Customer service is non-existent! I have emailed them and I either don't hear back or they don't know the answer.  I have to continue the conversation which gets responses days later. This is what happens when you got somebody there that has to have the answers for everything and they simply don't because SmallRig hasn't offered this many different products until recently. I think they make quality stuff, but if you're looking for support or a device that you can learn completely day one, buy Tilta or another brand because it ain't here.<br /><br />Now let's talk about the motor... it is quite progressive but fairly weak causing it to jump when doing pulls. It will do fine for most lenses, however it will have problems with stiffer lenses. The motor does not have enough torque and is limited to 7.2v with the battery and I cannot seem to pull anything more than 5.2v on USB C. This was pretty disappointing... Tilta Nucleus Nano (which is ancient), can pull 18v. Now I may be mistaken, but SmallRig customer service is non-existent and there aren’t any good instructions so I don't know if there's a way to increase the torque or voltage.<br /><br />Outside of the above, everything else is great! I like the displays, the brightness, the record button and how I can change the color of the LED on the knob. I also like how the color of the knob will change when recording and that it can be shut off. I also like how you can flip the display on the knob, but I hate that you can flip the display on the motor. Calibration is also simple and easy. I would love to be able to set waypoints on buttons instead of turning the knob. That way you can press a button and have it pull at a steady speed.<br /><br />Anywho... the search for the perfect FF motor continues. This will likely end up on eBay as soon as Tilta's next gen Nucleus comes out.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717qADA0PsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717qADA0PsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717qADA0PsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WDC6WnS4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WDC6WnS4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WDC6WnS4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BG2RR7JS,B0BG2RR7JS,AGH67UILWCPXJEKKYL6ZNBTTEXDQ,2023-02-08 06:59:01.429,2,True,508
758652,4,"If you have cute kids, PICK could be a gold mine of adorable images","[[VIDEOID:61593b9b2be27e5176e7f66dc3b30b6b]] The Canon Power Shot PICK is an impressive mini AI robot camera.  The package contains everything you need to get started- an Anker PD charger and small Sandisk mSD (TF) card.  You have to download the Canon Mini PTZ app to your phone, and setup is pretty quick and easy via Bluetooth.  During operation, the PICK will routinely ask to set up a local WiFi connection to your phone, when it senses the need for additional bandwidth, such as streaming video.  I suspect the PICK would probably be delightful for a family with small children, where it could no doubt capture some adorable images and video.<br />We don't have any human children, so I attempted to use it with our cats.  The facial recognition is good for people, not so much for felines.  You can control it with your phone, not unlike an IP security camera, which is how I captured the attached feline images and video.  Using a magic arm, I tried clamping the camera to a chair leg to get it down to cat level, and all of the cats immediately spotted it as soon as they heard the PTZ motor kick in.  Our almost 20 year old cat regarded it with suspicion and left the room- the camera did auto track her as she fled to safety.  The youngest, 19 month old Tishna, stalked up to the camera, put nose to lens, swatted the PICK several times, then reached up and pulled it down to the floor! This took all of 20 seconds-video attached.  Prior to this, the camera did learn to track 'cats' (sort of) - it produced a number of 10 second video clips of any large dark object, including the front of the garbage disposal and the black plastic food trays on the floor.  It did easily learn my face, and very effectively followed me around the room, which was a bit unnerving at first.  The resulting images and video were very sharp- closeups showed every enlarged pore, acne scar and wrinkle in detail.  Definitely not Instagram material, but the camera is not to blame.  If you have a few adorable kids to 'PICK', I fully expect this device could be a gold mine of cute images and video, if you have time to 'PICK' out the gems.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CVEP+VNzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CVEP+VNzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CVEP+VNzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ICK4IUiKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ICK4IUiKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ICK4IUiKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VRoGIefOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VRoGIefOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VRoGIefOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61csnR+nm2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61csnR+nm2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61csnR+nm2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dqg1nm1jL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dqg1nm1jL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dqg1nm1jL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iT5UPHTlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iT5UPHTlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iT5UPHTlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pvxhLqdUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pvxhLqdUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pvxhLqdUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sawl+O2gL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sawl+O2gL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sawl+O2gL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711UjyBRj7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711UjyBRj7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711UjyBRj7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B9V68JZ8,B0BCQ67ZNV,AHKB5NBSSH3OXHZ4FS46RG6KANSQ,2023-01-06 01:07:09.926,0,False,508

You need only to view the images in the product listing to ascertain their size.  For example, observe the adult-sized human hand holding one of them.  You can plainly see that the stickers are on the small side but not smaller than most other stickers made to be applied to small objects.  Again, look how--in the online product description--they are applied to water bottles and the top corner of a writing journal.  I am making these points because I am always amazed when people neither read nor observe product information and then give a less than stellar review on that basis.  It is unfair.<br /><br />2) Rather than being adhered to sticker sheets, the stickers are individually cut and enclosed in a box to keep them neat and tidy.  This way, you use what you need without ending up with stacks of partially used sticker sheets that often end up sticking to one another and destroying some of the unused stickers.  I love the packaging of this product.<br /><br />3) The printing and material are of the highest quality with a lot of detail packed into each and every sticker.<br /><br />4)  The stickers are easy to peel away from their backing without tearing, and they adhere to various surfaces, including paper and plastic.  They could also be used in a well-lacquered decoupage project.  You might apply them to lunch boxes, stationery paper, envelopes, invitations, and place cards at weddings, tea parties, and Easter brunch.

Reading about the differences I was expecting the picture on my new Dell to be a bit of a downgrade on how the colors would pop.  I was willing to make this tradeoff for more screen real estate.  However while there is a difference in the two monitors, as to be expected between any monitors, the color issue is nonexistent.  This monitor, hooked through the display port, running at 144 HZ, on a 1660 super card is simply brilliant.<br /><br />I did a lot of youtube research before deciding on what model to buy and this one kept coming up as the best in it's class as a VA screen.  The next possible option was to go IPS and spend another $300-350.  I'm glad I decided to save a bit of cash and go with this Dell.<br /><br />It's bright, clear, with no dead or bright pixels.  Sitting in front of the screen there is no fade as one looks to the edges.  Also for a VA screen one can go quite a ways side to side before noting any fade in the picture.  To me that is a nonissue anyway as I'm always at the desk if using the computer.<br /><br />I was going to install it on my moveable arm but, the stand is so nice, and the monitor so big that I decided not to do that.  Instead I used the included stand and it works great.  My adjustable arm and old 27"" were moved together to my old standby computer and are doing quite well there.<br /><br />The only issue I had was registering it at Dell.  When I clicked on the link at their site to register it would only take me to their diagnostic tool that would determine what product I  had.  Here's where the trouble started as it would only scan my pc, not a Dell, and say my computer couldn't be registered.  Duh, it's not a Dell.  So to register it to my Dell account I had to call Dell support and talk to a tech who completed the registration for me.<br /><br />I've had it now for almost three weeks and couldn't be happier with my choice.",[],B095X7RV77,B0B1Y2MYHZ,AHTXWRWLBNO4PREIVGXKEYUGFYAA,2023-01-30 19:08:34.802,15,True,508

Now that it's here and I tried both laptops I'm sticking with the ROG.<br /><br />Great<br />- Can upgrade the SSD drive<br />- Only slightly heavier than my Yoga and runs much quieter and cooler<br />- Fine for running basic games on ultra settings<br />- Fingerprint reader on power button is great<br />- Touchscreen is really responsive<br />- Armoury Crate app is great, providing a lot of options for how the machine runs based on specific apps, RGB effects, and like wallpapers<br />- Runs on USB-C power<br />- Sound quality is excellent<br /><br />Not so Great<br />- Can't upgrade the Ram (I wish it had a 32Gb option)<br />- By default it uses the integrated video to save battery, but I had to mess with Armoury Crate settings to get a game to run using the 3050 card (using Turbo mode), which I wish were out of the box<br />- Screen resolution is fine, but I wish it were slightly higher<br />- Like Surfaces, the keyboard feel is going to be a dust/hair magnet<br />- Still makes more noise than a Surface, but FAR less than any gaming laptop (the Alienware was insanely loud running just app updates)<br />- I mostly stay plugged in, but I'm sure the battery will die in no time when running unplugged<br />- I wish each key had an individual RGB setting, but it's not really critical, and I like that I can have the colors set based on the CPU temp or usage",[],B09RMPV211,B0C31R6WT1,AFHG3ZJ6XRV6OUAHKABS7P63K6NA,2023-02-23 14:31:20.573,5,True,508
430798,5,Expensive made cheap,"I'd like to start off by stating that I've been using it ever since it arrived. Theres a lot of pros to this product. For starters it has great quality in sound and keeping ambient noise out. The earphones fit snuggly and ensure that sound is consistent and clear. The great fit keeps any noises including bus noises to a minimum. I commute using public transportation and can normally hear various conversations going on but with this product I was able to cancel those out and listen to my music without any interuptions. They stay in without moving during exercise sessions like cardio or lifting weights. Keeping in line with this, the earphones are also useful on the go anywhere.<br />Another thing that I'd like to point out is battery. These last quite a while by themselves and with the case, it lasts a whole lot longer. I'm able to use them for hour long gym sessions or studying in public without having to worry about battery for a while. The case also holds charge very well compared to other products on the market and is designed such that the earphones fit without being loose into the case so you don't hear rattling of any kind and that you can also see the state of charge via a LED display that shows you the exact charge on the device. It's really great in that sense because you're able to tell exactly how much battery you have left in the case before having to charge it.<br />Lastly, and my most important point about this product is wireless charging. I've bought $50 earphones, I've bought $20 ear phones, I've bought all kinds of audio head sets but until now I haven't had wireless charging on any of them. The earphones I was using before didn't have wireless charging and as a person that loves to move, its annoying to keep wires for different things. I'm also a very heavy user of wireless charging especially now that its becoming more commonplace and lots of other products like cars and phones have wireless charging built in, these earphones make it easy to move around as I only need maybe one wireless charger and it can charge my phone and my earphones. Less wires is always better so you don't have to worry about replacing them or making sure you have the right one.<br />Overall, this product is definitely something that you want to take advantage of. A quality audio, long last battery with LED display built into the case and wireless charging. Those are the hallmarks of quality and product viability for people everywhere.",[],B0BVHWWJTN,B0BVHWWJTN,AFHO5HG6UMZLDZZE6N7PFDTTUQ2Q,2023-04-24 13:52:43.458,1,True,508
397227,1,Several things about Mine Doesn't work!,"I was really looking forward to getting this so that I could connect my wireless headphones to my non-Bluetooth audio receiver/amp. Sadly I cannot get my brand new Bluetooth 5.3 headphones or my Bluetooth 5.0 earbuds to connect to it. I tried everything including resetting and un-pairing each from the other components they were connected to. This is problem #1 and by far the biggest discouragement as it is what I specifically got this for.<br /><br />Problem #2, The unit has a switch to change from APTX LL to APTX HD audio format and has an indicator light that is supposed to correspond to the setting it is set to. On mine, neither of the lights come on no matter the switch setting and the switch makes no perceptible difference in sound quality.<br /><br />Problem #3, I set it up to also pass through audio over ToSLink optical from my TV to my receiver/amp. Before adding this my TosLink went direct from my TV to my receiver/amp and I enjoyed DTS audio. With this now in the middle doing pass through I can only get a my TV to output stereo or Dolby Pro Logic to get sound. If I set my TV to DTS or DTS Neo 2.5 all I get is loud static.<br /><br />Other Problems, but not really a big deal as I knew this when getting but the unit does not include a power brick for charging. Normally my entertainment system can be fully controlled by remote and it is inconvenient to have to switch this unit on and off manually every time I sit down to watch something. I did get around this though by plugging the USB charge cord into the TV and leaving the unit turned on.<br /><br />In the end the only thing that seems to work well is that it successfully paired to my mobile phone allowing me to play music from my phone to my receiver/amp and the range is good. I can go upstairs in my house with my phone and it doesn't cut out. Being able to use my phone as a music source on my receiver/amp is the only reason I am still using it. Otherwise I would probably toss it in the bin and will probably do just that once something better comes along that can do everything I need it to do.<br /><br />Overall I am very unhappy with this. Given the mostly good reviews, maybe I just got a defective unit, IDK.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6170LyeBgpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6170LyeBgpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6170LyeBgpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BKK5SRX6,B0BKK5SRX6,AEE6XSCBC4DMA44LOI47R55QIYYA,2023-01-07 21:33:00.736,0,False,507
511072,5,COOLEST MINI TRIPOD YET!,"I have had a lot of tripods over the years (I've had a LOT of stuff over these many years at that) and I find this to be about the best little photographic accessory I have had in a long time.  First, it appears to be well thought out and engineered to be something that you could be happy to own and in my opinion, it is.<br /><br />Starting out with the actual tripod base, it's legs are textured if you want to hold your camera, phone, etc. in your hand and very compact.  The legs snap out to a tight tripod stance and press the Red button in the center and the legs open further to a wide stance with rubber feet to keep it from slipping or sliding around.  The tripod ""Head"" is extremally versatile and well designed with professional features like 360º rotation, 90º tilt and an accessory ¼""-20 threaded mount hole.<br /><br />The cell phone mount is the best I've seen so far, you don't have to strain to spread it to put the phone in it, you just push another Red button and it pops open and you place your phone in and squeeze to hold the phone securely.  It has 2 accessory ¼""-20 threaded mount holes, one on the bottom like everyone else and one on the side, again, well thought out and versatile.  There is an extension arm with a ¼-20"" treaded mount that can be used collapsed or extends about 20 inches as a selfie stick or above the crowd, plus it works as an elevated extension to the tripod section.<br /><br />Finally, it comes with a Wireless Bluetooth remote control made with a U.S. chip for remote picture or video shooting up to 30 feet away for convenience which is nice to have.  There is one thing I absolutely did NOT like was the .... manual???  They created a new format in instructions, there is normal, small, tiny, mini, micro and now ""NANO"" Type.  Okay, I took some closeup pictures with my phone to read, but really, is that necessary to make everything so darn small?  I'll live with it and I wouldn't hesitate to spend $29.99 on this if I didn't get it at no cost other than an honest and truthful evaluation.  The product description has complete pictures on every aspect of its versatility, so not much point in me adding any, but I did anyway.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616JKqF6m7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616JKqF6m7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616JKqF6m7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xLcYmEHTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xLcYmEHTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xLcYmEHTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BJP4K8S4,B0BJC1NW9T,AHUO7OXBXR7FGHEPH6AYKI2JEAMQ,2023-01-22 23:08:47.728,0,False,507
87877,5,Outstanding Convenience and Versatility - A Must-Have for Every Tech Enthusiast!,"I recently purchased the Anker Outlet Extender and USB Wall Charger, and I must say it has exceeded all my expectations! This device is an absolute game-changer, providing a perfect solution for anyone in need of extra power outlets and USB ports.<br /><br />Firstly, the build quality of this extender is top-notch. The sleek design seamlessly integrates with my home decor, and the sturdy construction assures me of its durability. Anker's reputation for high-quality products is certainly upheld with this outstanding extender.<br /><br />The presence of six additional outlets is a huge plus, as it enables me to power multiple devices simultaneously without the need for additional power strips cluttering up my space. I can now conveniently connect my laptop, smartphone, tablet, and even a lamp, all from one central location. It's a true convenience that saves me time and hassle.<br /><br />The two built-in USB ports are a fantastic addition, especially with the inclusion of a 20W USB-C power delivery. Charging my USB-C devices has never been faster or more efficient. It's incredibly convenient to have dedicated USB ports available without sacrificing the use of the outlets.<br /><br />What sets this extender apart from others on the market is the intelligent charging technology. It automatically detects and delivers the optimal charging speed for each connected device, ensuring fast and safe charging every time. I no longer have to worry about overloading or damaging my devices.<br /><br />Furthermore, the inclusion of surge protection provides an extra layer of security for my valuable electronics.

Whether I'm staying in a hotel room or working in a coffee shop, I can easily carry this device in my bag and have access to multiple outlets and USB charging ports wherever I go.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot recommend the Anker Outlet Extender and USB Wall Charger highly enough. Its combination of superb build quality, versatile functionality, and intelligent charging capabilities make it a must-have for anyone seeking convenience and efficiency in their daily lives. Anker has once again delivered an exceptional product, and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and invest in this outstanding extender.

936894,5,Pretty solid budget option with some limitations,"I bought this because I have a Gaming Desktop and a work laptop (connected to a thunderbolt dock that has DP out) and I was previously using a USB switcher and manually changing the monitor input from DP to HDMI (dock).<br /><br />I have a 44"" 3840x1200 display and had to drop to 120Hz to stop flickering, was hoping that since it could support 120hz in 4k that I could get the full 144Hz but no dice.  The 24 lost Hz is a fair tradeoff for the price and convenience that this unit offers though.<br /><br />As far as EDID, etc. goes, my windows pretty much remember where they were when switching back and forth, Microsoft may have added some extra functionality in Win 11 to help make up for any deficiencies there but not sure without further investigation.  Suffice to say with this KVM + Windows 11 I don't have issues with windows minimizing or all going to one screen.<br /><br />I bought 3 DP 1.4 cables separately and didn't use the included cables with this (there are 2 but you need 3, and I'd recommend getting 3 of the exact same cable.  I left my old DP cable connected to my monitor and the new cables for the two PC connections and it didnt work until I swapped the original monitor cable for one of the new ones, so just food for thought).<br /><br />Switching is pretty snappy, takes maybe 2-3 seconds.<br /><br />Remote works surprisingly well.  Have the unit hidden under my 2.5"" solid maple desk and the remote goes through it.  Occasionally have to press the buttons more than once but for me thats fine.<br /><br />Only thing more I'd like to see possibly is inclusion of Audio, but I have a USB 3.5mm jack connected to the USB hub that's connected to the shared ports on the KVM which serves the same purpose (with less cables).  The 3 shared usb 3.0 ports are a nice touch too, more than you get with most KVMs twice the size/price, and I was able to connect a separate USB hub to one of them for more ports for more shared devices with no issues.<br /><br />Overall, for the price, it's a great pickup as long as you don't care too much about high refresh rates in higher or widescreen resolutions for gaming.",[],B098TVP9ZL,B098TVP9ZL,AFEPKF5JLSQYQ6OCNAQ3C4QCV3RA,2023-03-14 18:00:22.215,0,True,507
776512,5,Inexpensive but fully featured and works well.,"I finally had a chance to road test this dual camera while driving on a day with heavy snowfall.  Not having any smooth dash surface to attach it to I mounted it to the windshield next to the rear view mirror.  The suction cup is the type with a lever that allows you to forcibly draw it down once a seal is established, which is much more positive than the simple push-down suction cups.<br /><br />I did not try out the many operating modes for motion detection, the gravity sensor, or parking options, instead opting for the simple mode where it turns on with the ignition to capture only driving events.  The picture-in-picture mode on the display makes it easy to set up the adjustable rear-facing driver (or passenger) camera.  The buttons for operating the various functions are imprinted with fairly subtle symbols and are a bit hard to read. I would have preferred some high contrast text, but once you learn the button functions this is not an issue.<br /><br />I did go through the settings to set the exposure to -1, turn on Wide Dynamic Range, and make sure that the highest resolution recording (of 3 choices) was set. When I was initially testing the camera by using it like a hand held camcorder I felt that the auto-exposure response was a little slow, but in the vehicle this was totally a non-issue.<br /><br />On the road I could see that the progressive scan of the camera was making the moving windshield wipers look like rubber hoses, but both the driver and road video quality was perfectly adequate because of the relatively low rate of motion.  The snowfall looked like it was being taken through a high speed shutter, and I was quite impressed by the detail in the video in the full HD (FHD) mode.  Because of the windshield mount I was picking up a lot of wiper noise, but the audio recording was always more than adequate to capture conversations.<br /><br />The front and rear videos are captured as separate files in short segments with time stamps on the TF memory card, so it is easy to go back and find an event should the need arise.<br /><br />I still have a hard time understanding how you can get so much functionality for this price. I can imagine finding uses for this dual camera outside of the vehicle such as for a temporary security camera. This seems like a very good value and is highly recommended.",[],B0BKSMG99F,B0BKSMG99F,AH4K2USV745EQMXZRXSPAPSVHWAA,2023-01-18 14:53:09.637,1,False,507
861297,2,"Good case, but getting old","So, a Noctua NH-D15 is a common air cooler for people with fast and power hungry CPUs and don't want to use water cooling for the many different reasons that a person could possibly have.  For people wanting air cooling and want to get the beefier ones because you have a CPU that uses more power, 170mm clearance over the CPU for an air cooler is a pretty reasonable ask from a company, and with a case like this it SHOULD be able to deal with bigger air coolers, but no.  I had to replace the front fan that came with the Noctua NH-D15 with a 120mm fan.  Yes, some of this falls on the cooler design, but still, this is supposed to be a performance case for gaming.<br /><br />The next issue I have with the case are the ports.  NONE of the ports worked for me except the USB 2 ports.  I wish this was a rare problem but I've seen it a few times with different case manufacturers where you get one case and the ports work and another one and something in the front doesn't work.  I can't give 5 stars to a company if this VERY SIMPLE THING of making sure the ports work by either having a manufacturing process that ensures they will work or checking them.  I can't even plug a headset into the front port and that's pathetic.  This is the first time I've had both USB 3 ports and a sound port be an issue.  When testing the USB 3 ports it corrupted data coming off the disk and after unplugging from this system I had to reformat the drive because the partition got corrupted and locked up the next system I plugged it into.<br /><br />So as far as the front ports this case was a disaster, as far as the clearance over the CPU, it's on the ""olden days"" side.  Yes there's enough clearance for the old faithful Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO, from more than a decade ago, but aren't we past that now?<br /><br />I can't give more than 4 stars for a case that's supposed to be a high quality gaming case but can't accept more modern air coolers and the NH-D15 seems to be the one many people want to use for high end builds without using water, and I have to take off a star for each port that doesn't work.<br /><br />Two stars.",[],B07DRVHBWK,B0BZND6YQR,AGUQGQK6FECFB3TWBCV6FTWD5IRQ,2023-02-04 02:02:14.576,1,True,507
82589,5,"Super lightweight, good Teams integration","Used this work my work laptop. The corporate environment is locked down so no third party software or drivers are allowed. Fortunately the plug-and-play drivers worked first time and Microsoft Teams even popped up with a notice about a certified device connecting.<br /><br />Hopped right into a meeting with the headphones. The Mute function causes Teams to mute but also mutes the microphone at the hardware level The microphone is truly 'cold' when muted. There is also the mute button on the cable which I use rather frequently - It hasn't missed a beat even when muting every in between sentences. It just a little bit irksome that every time you mute the headphones make a sound that say ""Mute On"" at about the same volume as everyone speaking. I wish it was just a beep like my old Plantronics headset.<br /><br />There are also volume adjust buttons on the inline remote which I used a few times. It jumps the volume by 6% at the OS level every push of the button.<br /><br />There's a Teams button which supposedly responds to notifications from Teams as they pop up but I never had a notification be so critically urgent that I needed a dedicated button to address them. I never used the button. I feel there may be others out there where this may not be the case.<br /><br />The audio quality is actually pretty good. These aren't the type of headphones I'd normally use for listening to music since they're mainly a communications headset but regardless the option is there. When naturally resting on the ears the bass is somewhat light and the overall sound feels bright but pushing down on the headphones slightly has the bass come more forward. Not practical to be pushing down on the pads like that but if you have a wide head or perhaps aftermarket pads it's something to consider if they're a daily driver. Not that any of that matters for the average Teams call; Everyone is calling from their bluetooth earpieces so it all sounds like compressed garble. If they all used wired microphones it'd be way better. The quality also goes down when the microphone is in use, it seems to drop the output sampling rate below 44.1khz. If you're looking to use this for gaming, it's not ideal.<br /><br />Update: I previously mentioned the tilt function mutes. That isn't the case, the mic is still hot when up. Just tap the mute button and it'll mute.",[],B09BF97X7C,B0C7Q15RNN,AHQJLGSQVQJIU5JKKPQPCUTVFOWQ,2023-01-31 00:34:37.646,0,False,507

As you can clearly see it comes in a white box that says tablet and, on the side, says made it China. Thats not an issue at all so I opened the box to see the tablet in a protective silk like bag. I took the tablet out and thought the screen felt weird and notice it already had a screen protector on installed. That was a very nice touch and then when I looked in the bottom of the box there was another screen protector include. So, you get two screen protectors include with your purchase. It also came with two USB-A to USB-C cables. One is very short and the second seems like 3 feet. There's also a user's manual but it doesn't have a picture of what each button or plug on tablet is, but it's easy to figure out.<br /><br />The tablet comes with a USB-C power port, plus the sd card slot to expand storage. Slot looks like a micro or mini manual doesn't tell us anything. It just covers operating system. Love that this tablet has a headphone jack, and it works great. I personally would use that over the built in stereo speakers. Built in speakers don't get very loud and sound lifeless. There's also a volume rocker up and down and the power button which is about the size of a USB_C insert.<br /><br />Operation: Tablet start right away had about 80 percent battery. right away it searched for Wi-Fi network, and I picked my network, and it brought me to set up via a google account. I did a clean install and within 5 minutes tablet was running. There's no update to android 11 but there are updates for aps installed via play store. That was the longest portion of set up downloading updates from the play store. As for the camera, well let's just say its fuzzy even with flash. The rear camera even when using flash seems dark. I haven't tried front facing camera yet but didn't grab tablet for the camera. The tablet was very responsive and had zero touch issues.<br /><br />Last thought: For me I am not sure I would purchase this at $65, even with the extra protector. The quality of the cameras and the stereo speakers make it a hard choice at that price. If its $50 I would have zero issue with buying another.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZfaCgxUqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZfaCgxUqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZfaCgxUqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61c9Y35PyRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61c9Y35PyRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61c9Y35PyRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kmRMcuojL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kmRMcuojL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kmRMcuojL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nimbJue6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nimbJue6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nimbJue6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61swYJpsN4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61swYJpsN4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61swYJpsN4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BDXM327R,B0BDXKMQ7D,AHAXYMY2D32N75QZEDLCLQ27V3ZA,2023-01-19 06:41:38.076,2,False,507
935226,4,Good for nature watching. Easy to use. Tripod and phone attachment just OK to meh.,"This works well for getting a closer look at nature on the back porch or out the window. Easy to handle and use. Relatively light weight (definitely lighter than binoculars). One hand use and focus. I find it best for things that are a few hundred yards away that you want to get a better look at. May be my new companion on hikes as it’s easier to pack/store than binoculars.<br /><br />Tripod is just ok. One of the little rubber pieces on the bottom was already off when I took it out of the box. It’s not super adjustable, but it does work and helps keep the device steady if placed on a flat surface. You just have to adjust yourself to the height, as the height of the tripod itself is not adjustable and the legs do not lock… they are either open or closed. You can loosen the ball socket that holds the scope to change its angle, just not the height of the tripod.<br /><br />The phone attachment piece is not my favorite. After significant manipulation and frustration, I got it to work…kind of. Using this piece on the tripod is difficult because my phone sits lower than the leg of the tripod, hard to explain, but it’s a bit of a mess. Honestly, the hassle factor using the phone attachment piece was too much and I really don’t see me using it. There are no directions, so you have to look at the picture to figure out how it works (basically it just clips over the scope… similar to the eyehole cover).<br /><br />Even with the phone attachment and tripod shortcomings, I do like the scope itself. It’s easy to use, and brings nature a little closer to me. I did try using it to look at the moon and stars, as it’s advertised as being useful for stargazing, but I don’t think it was great for this. It does bring things a little closer, but not like a decent pair of binoculars or a telescope. I find it best for things that are a few hundred yards away that you want to get a better look at. The glass is not quite the green color shown in the pictures… if you look at it in the right light, it looks like it has a green tint – not that it matters, just don’t expect it to be that bright green color shown.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/411o4xncOaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/411o4xncOaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/411o4xncOaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610AnyWgnOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610AnyWgnOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610AnyWgnOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jIolSrBQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jIolSrBQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jIolSrBQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BNZZ6FFT,B0BP1J5KMC,AFIEQFLQW5SAF2XE2VIJRWT46WVA,2023-03-06 17:23:12.624,0,False,507

I have been an in house reviewer on advance projects for multiple companies that are big enough and well known enough that I'm cool with admitting I'm too much of a little b*tch to namedrop for effect because of what they can and WILL do if I break their ndas. I've seen companies grow from niche providers to become household names to the world. Out of all the years and all the cool things I've seen this company is a true nk silk in a field of broken box jade click bars if you catch the krytox I'm whippin. My little dude just finished his new gaming board with a red and black theme so when I saw this I figured getting a coiled cable to look good should be easy enough for them to achieve at an acceptable for us to use on one of our own projects. I can't even express the surprise and pure love for the bigger open market that keyboard building has become, because without it no company would've been able to hit this level of value at such a low price. Honestly I am having a little bit of a hard time seeing why we ever were expected to pay 2 to 3 times the price of this, especially when this is one of the best looking cords I have ever had the pleasure of getting my mitts on. It took everything in me to not revert to a childish state and get into a pissing match over it with an 11 year old. Razer, Glorious, Logitech, watch out there's a not just a new player in the game if they can keep this quality to cost value through the inflation like they have, because if they do there's a whole new game to be played and the first shot has been taken. If they have the color or theme your looking for stop right there and have faith they understand how things should be. Put your money and support behind them and watch the rat race while some play catch up and others  just darwin their way out because of refusal to be true to the people who got them where they are.

178669,5,"A Winner:  Sharp images, can't-miss-it lens cover, and no-fuss Windows install","What I like:  Checks all the boxes for a decent quality video conferencing solution.<br /><br />What could be better:  Some may prefer a less obvious lens cover<br /><br />Out-of-the-box experience was smooth as silk.  The camera has a mounting hinge-style base / lever that secures the camera along the top edge of my LCD monitor, snug enough that it won't budge with an occasional jostle.  The supplied USB cable is more than enough length to run from the camera to my monitor's USB port.  It is probably long enough to run between the camera and a below-desk PC case.<br /><br />My Windows 10 OS recognized the camera and microphone automatically.  I fired up a Zoom meeting, using a nearby computer as the second participant, and observed the camera's behaviors in all its glory.  Display rendering is spot-on and of generous dimensions (wide angle).  I'm no video expert but to my everyday user's eyes, image rendering is perfect, with the usual, subtle ambient lighting found in a working office environment.<br /><br />Audio quality is also fine, using it for its primary use case of a video conference call.<br /><br />When reviewing the materials shipped with the camera, I couldn't find any reference to specific software to tweak camera behavior.  If you're the sort who wants to dabble with the image or audio settings, it seems using either Windows or a third party platform will be your answer there.  For me, there are no adjustments needed, and in any event the Zoom platform I use provides more than enough toys to play with there.<br /><br />The camera has a lens cap that's affixed to the housing with a short, but quite adequate string.  It is easy enough to apply or remove the lens cap, which lies on its string behind the monitor when not in use.  The cap is easy to recognize, so there's no doubt your image isn't going anywhere, when you don't want it to.  Yes, there is an LED that illuminates when the camera is ""hot.""  I suppose the cap is provided to ensure that no image will be available, even if malicious software could activate the camera without illuminating the LED warning.<br /><br />Overall, there is much to like here, especially for my routine use cases.

43308,1,SO FRUSTRATING!!!,"I’ve attached the pictures that are the main instructions for how to get this thing set up. After plugging in the power cord, the expectation is that you’re either plugging it into a Bluetooth device like a smartphone, which usually makes pairing easy, because the easy on-screen Bluetooth pairing procedure, or the directions expect that you are connecting it to a basic stereo type device, which isn’t too far off of what I am trying to do. My connection doesn’t have an on-screen toggle or pairing code; I am trying to connect it to a television, so that it will pick up the Bluetooth signal to my Little Bose speaker that I have sitting beside the bed. I’ve been using the “transmitter from TV to Bose” via Bluetooth set up for a number of years, until recently, when my former transmitter puffed up and died. It literally swelled up and stopped working. So I went on the hunt for another transmitter to send a signal to my sweet little Bluetooth speaker. I’m hearing impaired, so this has been a fantastic way for me to be able to not only hear the TV when I’m in bed, but it also improves the TV watching experience, because Bose offers a superior sound experience above that which my television’s speakers do.<br />These instructions, however, do not offer any other insight after you’ve plugged in the power cord. From that part of the set up, the choice of which type of audio device cord connection is the only other pictorial information offered. I have tried to find something online that would give more insight about how to make this happen, but there is nothing about what to do when both the transmitter and the Bluetooth speaker to which I’m trying to connect are flashing blue as if they are trying to find a signal to connect, but they are not connecting to each other. So, now I have to return this darn thing, and try to find another transmitter like the one I used to have that never gave me any trouble and connected immediately and worked with all different types of speakers, JBL, Bose, my iPhone, my iPad, my earbuds, etc.<br />I am quite technically savvy when it comes to things like this. I was a DJ and engineer in radio for many years, I have worked in IT for decades, and yet this tiny little black box has really pissed me off!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tbguXtfgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tbguXtfgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tbguXtfgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DUIBRPpUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DUIBRPpUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DUIBRPpUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TCh5ApfIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TCh5ApfIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TCh5ApfIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B016NUTG5K,B016NUTG5K,AELTA3PCFAAAS4VY5V32IXHZAKZA,2023-03-16 00:07:04.524,1,True,507
405192,4,Awesome Bass! Lacking treble/high,"I come from a 5.1 surround system to a 2.1 because I wanted to downsize a bit, so I bought this 2.1, and I have to say that I was very impressed with the Z623.<br /><br />I have no words to describe the bass quality! I have a slab foundation, and the house still shakes with 75% bass and with a volume level of around 15%. So, I am 100% satisfied with the bass. I usually have my bass level at 100%, but with this unit, I cannot afford to do that. It's too much. I tried putting it at 100% with a low volume level, and the sound quality stood its ground. I gradually increased the volume, and I did not notice any issue beyond shaking my house. I didn't get to 100 to test its limit, but I didn't feel it would be an issue if I did, though my neighbors would probably have a thing or two to say about that.<br /><br />The speakers look gorgeous and are of great sound quality for their size. They fit nicely on my computer desk. The size of the subwoofer was surprising. That thing is huge. I would have preferred something smaller. But that's neither bad nor good. It's about your preference. Just keep in mind that the picture doesn't do the size justice.<br /><br />Now, my main issue with the unit is the lack of crisp sound with not enough treble/high power. This causes the sound to be muffled, and that drives me insane. This could be a personal preference, but I am annoyed listening to sound where the treble/high frequencies are subdued. Unfortunately, this is what I feel about this unit. Sadly, this is a big issue for me and will be returning the unit.<br /><br />I bought the analog version, and I noticed some initial buzz (This buzz does not last, is just an initial buzz and it goes away. It is kind of like when you receive a notification message, the sound gives this kind of buzz effect as if the speakers were dying) that comes with using that type of connection. However, I think using the optical output would solve that issue.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great unit if the treble/high frequency of the sound is not a big issue for you. You will love it. While it is not for me, I definitely would recommend it!",[],B003VAHYTG,B01C6ESQM6,AHGIZGPWKLAOGZODHS37IPJQFZQQ,2023-03-01 17:41:53.853,3,True,507
14807,3,Great Sound Quality & Best Noise Cancellation BUT…,"They have EXCELLENT sound quality. GREAT bass, good mid range & good treble. All three can be enhanced through the EQ in the app. They sound slightly better than AirPods Pro 2 and the Beats Pro Fit earbuds but when you add more bass & slightly increase the treble through the EQ... No contest! It’s only adversary in sound quality would be the Status Between Pro for half the price but no bells and whistles like ANC or Transparnecy mode. Status Between Pro ear buds have much clearer mids and treble and a solid bass.<br /><br />And the Noise Cancellation is arguably the best. Better than AirPods Pro 2 (a close 2nd), Anker earbuds, Sony ear buds, Beats Fit Pro, etc.<br /><br />It’s Transparency mode matches AirPods Pro 2. I’d argue they have the best transparent modes on the market as others sound too “tinny” and/or have latency issues, sounding like you’re in an echo chamber.<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />I’ve gone through 3 sets of replacements… and I am done.<br /><br />I had constant connectivity issues. They would intermittently disconnect from my iPhone X stating “iPhone Lost”. I’d get a new replacement, all was well and then after the most recent update, back to having intermittent connectivity issues.<br /><br />Also, the earbuds literally fell out of my ear like butter irregardless of what band and ear tip combination I chose. These are the only earbuds on the market I found that I had issues with keeping in my ear. BOSE had much better earpieces on their past earbuds although they didn’t have a great “seal”. These have a great deal but slip out of my ear! I have ZERO issues keeping an unsupported AirPod Pro 2 earbud in my ear. Odd.<br /><br />Customer Support was great, making exchanges/replacements easy.<br /><br />Overall I would’ve kept them due to exceptional sound quality and ANC BUT I couldn’t get past the connectivity issues.

No space, not even for updates.<br /><br />I really love the battery life on the laptop. I've used it for 8 hours, and there was about 20% left, and it charges very quickly. It's compact, easy to fit in backpacks, and on small desks for typing.  It's very light, I kept checking my bag to make sure it was in there, and the color was beautiful.<br /><br />I would have loved to keep this laptop and wish I could, but unfortunately, the keyboard kept getting stuck. The caps lock light would remain on even though it was typing in regular letters and would type weird characters. I googled the problem, and it seems as if the shift keys got stuck. So, after fixing that problem, it was another problem with the keyboard, and I had to google the fix. This occurred pretty frequently, and it got rather annoying.<br /><br />It was supposed to come with 1 year of Microsoft, but after 3 weeks, I got a pop-up message that said the Microsoft was about to expire. It was almost a MONTH of use, not a YEAR.<br /><br />Additionally, there was an update for the newest windows, but I did not have space. There is no way this laptop had 32 GB of ram. The system itself used up all the space, I had nothing on the laptop. I had to delete some of the items that came downloaded on the laptop, like solitaire.  Even with enough space, the download kept getting stuck and starting over. Then it said it needed more space, so I got a flash drive, and the same thing happened again.<br /><br />I only had the laptop for about a month and contacted HP because it should have been under warranty. They informed me that the warranty expired on this laptop 4 months before I even purchased it. I was so frustrated. At this point, I want to return the darn thing. I was putting in too much work for a laptop that was supposed to make my life easier.<br /><br />I can see other customers have had a similar experience, so my advice to new buyers would be, if you don't mind these things, then go for it but there is an issue with the keyboard and HP is aware of the issue because they have fixes on their support site.",[],B0B9HXH1YL,B0B9HXC6YN,AG2EITSNXP4Y3SUQMWZ6LAMVHA6A,2023-02-25 02:33:15.676,9,True,507

As a photography enthusiast, I must say that I absolutely love the NEZINI 4K Digital Camera for its impressive features, ease of use, and the exceptional image quality it delivers.

I wanted a point and shoot and at the same time I do have the option to play around with speed and light for the I<br />Ages that I after.<br /><br />With its 48MP resolution and advanced autofocus algorithm, capturing high-definition images is a breeze. Whether shooting close-ups or long-range views, the camera's 16x zoom and fast autofocus ensure excellent results. The CMOS image sensor further enhances picture quality and reduces noise for both photos and videos. It did took some time but once I figured it out, it so easy to use.<br /><br />This versatile camera offers 4K video recording, a pause function, and anti-shake technology, making it suitable for various shooting needs. The optical viewfinder enables real-time composition and minimizes the impact of outdoor light on photography. The retro design, user-friendly shooting mode dial, and small grip contribute to better stability while shooting. Additionally, the built-in flash and hotshoe allow for clearer images in low-light conditions and the option to connect external accessories like a fill light or microphone. With connectivity options such as HDMI and Type-C cables, it's easy to view content on a TV or upload files to a computer.<br /><br />It comes with a soft case. Two batteries. A charging cable and charging station. A manual, micro card and insert for SD reader and an HDMI cable.<br /><br />Overall, the NEZINI 4K Digital Camera strikes an excellent balance between performance and usability, making it an outstanding choice for capturing high-quality photos and videos. As a photography enthusiast, I can confidently say that this camera has exceeded my expectations in terms of features, image quality, and ease of use.<br /><br />The one thing I hope that it has was a water or weatherproof camera.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it and rate it about 4.5.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618wDK1AbCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618wDK1AbCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618wDK1AbCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HxE0gjoZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HxE0gjoZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HxE0gjoZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712tzw5P99L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712tzw5P99L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712tzw5P99L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ABrqK+CXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ABrqK+CXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ABrqK+CXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71AaUqp0EGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71AaUqp0EGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71AaUqp0EGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71e0-9Ja90L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71e0-9Ja90L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71e0-9Ja90L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ptk+vtxmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ptk+vtxmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ptk+vtxmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71r7q9DYX2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71r7q9DYX2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71r7q9DYX2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BXWLXBS3,B0C7RMG24D,AG6WO45JNBFQIBCX7S6NSUR6BATA,2023-05-15 03:54:59.135,2,True,507

I seriously loathe everything that I have that has the virtual keyboard to it. This includes my Samsung Galaxy S10 cellphone. I have a Samsung Moment that still have the keyboard but since the updates stopped for that phone I had to resort to getting a cellphone with no keyboard and this S10 is the second cellphone I own with no keyboard.<br /><br />I avoided getting a mini keyboard for the longest but I just about had enough with the virtual stuff!

Second teeth gritting moment...<br />So I have a USB-A to USB-C adapter from a portable cellphone hard drive and went to use that...Small problem, my protective case on my phone won't allow me to connect unless I take off the case. That could spell for disaster because I could drop that thin phone and break it.<br />I took the risk and was able to use the USB-A to USB-C adapter.

747386,1,"Buyer Beware, Not Recommended!","Honestly I try to be patient and understanding but after 3 strikes I just have to say something.<br /><br />I purchased this plan to cover my daughter's backpack. At the time the backpack was $44.99 so the plan that was selected was one with a coverage of $40-$49.99. The strap on my daughter's backpack tore so I began the claim process.<br /><br />I went to the website as instructed and selected the options presented. After going through their steps the process determined that I was not eligible for a claim and that I should instead contact the manufacturer. Let me state what the terms are for an eligible claim:<br /><br />What's covered by my plan?<br />Stains, rips or tears, seam separation, broken moving parts and more are covered from the date of purchase. Coverage for defects in materials and workmanship begins after the manufacturer's warranty ends.<br /><br />Rip is clearly stated there by them. So this was strike one. I decided to chat with the Asurion company instead of using their automated process and lo and behold I did qualify for a claim.<br /><br />After the claim was accepted and approved I was not happy to find out that I first had to send back the item before receiving a gift card. This is not ideal since my daughter needs a backpack to go to school with (even with a tore strap). I understand the reasoning but Amazon typically mails you out a replacement and if you don't return the original they charge you for the replacement. This is the ideal solution, so strike 2.<br /><br />Lastly, the amount I will be refunded will be $44.99 although the current price for this item is now $55.89. One would think that since I purchased the $40-49.99 coverage plan that they would refund me the maximum amount of $49.99 and that I would need to cover the additional cost. This makes sense right? Nope, they will only refund the original amount even though I paid the same price for this protection plan as someone who purchased an item worth $49.99. This was the last strike. Honestly... I wouldn't doubt that if the item dropped below $44.99 they would reimburse me the current price.

Firmware can be downloaded from the VANTrue support site.  The last step of the update will reformat the SD Card.<br /><br />The VANTrue E2 Dash CAM videos can be downloaded to your PC via the provided Type C data cable.  I would recommend downloading and installing them to your phone via the VANTrue App.  The App provides easy access to the videos via the built-in WiFi connection making viewing, downloading, and creating 30-second snippets of your videos.  These videos can then be shared via your favorite social media app.<br /><br />Voice Control - I was able to turn on and off the WiFi via voice control.  I tried several other word combinations to try and control the VANTrue E2 Dash Cam all of which failed.  An example is to take a snapshot.  I also had to turn up High Sensitivity.

941627,4,Excellent DMR Radio,"After a bunch of research, I purchased this radioo from Radioddity prior to the release. I'm very happy wiht the purchase. It's a very good DMR radio and works well.<br /><br />However, there are a few issues, so let's get them out of the way. First, volume controls & volume. The nice thing is, this radio is good and loud, a complaint many have of other radios. The complaint here is that it's a tad too loud. Further, the digital volume control is a bit laggy and acts kind of odd. This is not a huge deal, but it's a bit of a pain.<br /><br />Next, Analog APRS. It works. It really does. However, it doesn't work consistently. Some days I'm able to get the beacon to fire automatically, others, not so much. Manual transmission always works, so that's good. Also, no analog APRS receive, and it really should. It's an SDR radio (two actually), so this can, and should, be added with just a patch.<br /><br />And that's all I have to say bad about this radio. I've heard people complain about the code plug editor, but I found it basically OK. Maybe because I learned how to do code plugs on truly heinous software, merely poor software wasn't a big deal. Doesn't matter though because there's a 3rd party CPE from MM7DBT.<br /><br />I was able to program all the zones I wanted. I made contacts within those zones, and I was able to make digital, as well as analog, contacts. The signal reports were all very positive with no issues at all. Transmission and reception over distance is excellent. I even added a Signal Stick antenna to make it a bit better.<br /><br />Construction is very solid with good materials. Knobs and switches all have a positive feel and feedback (except for the already mentioned volume control). Battery life is good. The charging station can even charge two batteries at the same time.

926192,5,The best so far...,"[[VIDEOID:c782c1b61b15b3ef5ef9db4ced7cedd0]] Where I’m coming from: I have been looking for the perfect pair of earbuds for some time. I’ve tried the AirPods 2, LG Tone, and I have just about every set that TOZO produces; the NC2 has been my favorite set thus far.<br /><br />But I’ve still been looking…<br /><br />And I got the TOZO Golden X1s and maybe…<br /><br />So, here are details on each aspect:<br /><br />Audio: they sound fantastic. But with one caveat, you need to adjust them with the app. It made a huge change. It’s cool to do a hearing test with them and see how you need to adjust the EQ settings. Plenty loud too.<br /><br />ANC: Active noise cancellation. It works fine for what I need. It’s just peaceful. Wearing them in a car makes it nice and quiet.<br /><br />Case: I love the size. It easily fits in the pocket. Completely necessary to have the percentage of the battery charge. If your earbuds don’t have that, move on. Nice to drop it down on a charging pad at the end of the day. My only complaint is for some reason for me, I have a hard time opening the case. Not impossible; it’s just not an easy first-time opening.<br /><br />Fit: I’m still working on this one. This fits a little differently than some past ones. I wish they went a little deeper into my ear.<br /><br />Battery: These last, especially if you just charge them daily. I don’t ever run them out of juice.<br /><br />Bluetooth: Every now and then, one will disconnect and then immediately reconnect. I haven’t figured this out yet.<br /><br />Phone conversations: I experimented with my wife with five different earbuds, back to back. And she immediately said these X1s sound the best.<br /><br />So, best yet of TOZO’s attempt to make the best earbuds - for half the price of the “best” out there.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71djMddpOKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71djMddpOKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71djMddpOKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71i33IceHnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71i33IceHnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71i33IceHnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lsxsJ8exL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lsxsJ8exL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lsxsJ8exL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zuF4Rx-DL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zuF4Rx-DL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zuF4Rx-DL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BS3SYYBP,B0BS3SYYBP,AE3SBX366WBGKSV3OP56WX3LUCVQ,2023-03-26 20:10:29.047,0,True,507
467874,5,Marginal performance improvements over the original but still worth it,"I love the Godox Movelink wireless mic system since the first version. These mics are just as good as any other top brand system on the market, but in my opinion the Godox version just looks better.<br /><br />Honestly the mkII version only offers marginal improvements over the original version, but if you use these systems for work or paid gigs, then it’s well worth the upgrade. Otherwise if you just use the original Movelink system for personal use or small projects, you could probably save that money to invest in some of Godox’s other amazing products, such as their lights, as great audio and great lighting are the key elements to amazing production value.<br /><br />The Movelink mk II comes with just about everything the mk I came with in the kit, but the new textured design on the units look much better. They are basically identical in size and weight. The display on the mk II seems to have a higher resolution than the original, as the information on screen is a lot less pixelated. The improved display also gives you color, and for me that makes it stand out more and easy to identify when I monitor my levels.<br /><br />There is a slight improvement on the signal transmission as I did notice I could get a little more range when line of sight was broken. The audio quality is still as amazing as it has always been in the original Movelink. I’m not sure but I feel like the lav mics have been improved or the unit itself just has improved connectivity, as the audio I recorded through the lav mic was just a little cleaner.<br /><br />The battery life is great for these units. I know I can get through any session or project with confidence. The carry case quickly recharges your units in between use and the case itself charges fairly fast through the industry standard usb-c connection.<br /><br />There are a ton of little attachments and all the cables you need, come in this kit. The only feature lacking on this new model, that I wish they had incorporated would be the ability to record audio straight to the transmitter. That would give you a safeguard for your audio if you somehow lost signal, but this is in no way a reason to not purchase as the improved transmission greatly limits those scenarios.<br /><br />The Movelink upgraded version is an amazing kit and will serve majority, if not all users flawlessly.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kDwL6JXeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kDwL6JXeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kDwL6JXeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rpxZhKDZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rpxZhKDZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rpxZhKDZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BPY6JQSL,B0BPY6JQSL,AHWQRYH7KSBRMITJ65JDS7CR7CNQ,2023-02-21 16:07:08.388,0,False,507
116641,4,"Well Suited for Smaller TVs, etc.","I have a home recording studio that I've been using to digitize old VHS tapes and make copies of DVDs for friends and family.  YES!  Some people still watch DVDs.  But I've grown tired of the piddling sound from these dinky little PC speakers.  That's when I found the LARKSOUND Small Sound Bar.  Its a great alternative to the usual tiny tinny speakers you get with small TVs, monitors, smart phones and tablets, etc.<br /><br />If you're looking to upgrade your bedroom TV or PC audio, the LARKSOUND Small Sound Bar is adecent choice. It's not going to replace your JBL Soundbar and Woofer in the living room.  But despite its compact size, it delivers room-filling sound with a scaled back built-in subwoofer that produces clear and dynamic audio. With professionally tuned EQ modes for music, movies, voice, and normal, you can expect explosions, dialogue, and even subtle details in your favorite films to sound far crisper and more defined than ever before.  And it gets plenty loud for a medium sized room.<br /><br />What's more, the soundbar comes with a unique night mode that lowers the volume by 50% and compresses the bass to prevent disturbing others while they sleep, though I don't know anyone that's trying to ""suppress"" their bass...more like BOOST the bass if possible. I like that this soundbar also offers multiple connectivity options, including Bluetooth 5.0, USB, AUX IN, HDMI, and optical connections, making it incredibly versatile.  The BT worked flawlessly, was easy to connect and readily reconnected when I tested it out.<br /><br />The compact and low-profile design of this soundbar means that it won't take up much space in your room, and it easily fits under your TV.  It's flat so you might even be able to set the TV on it, assuming its small-sized.  You also get a remote control, an optical cable, an AUX cable, and a wall mounting kit, including a mounting template and step-by-step guide for easy installation.  Pretty cool setup for a secondary unit.<br /><br />Overall, the LARKSOUND Small Sound Bar is a great all-in-one solution for enhancing your TV or PC audio and making your movie and gaming experience even more enjoyable.",[],B0BRCQT22P,B0C5RJCXKJ,AH7XO5OG2U65MCO55ENPOJJ2OSDQ,2023-03-12 19:33:44.682,1,False,507
669333,5,Best for the Money at MSRP?!,"Let me start by saying obviously - this is the hardest card to get on the market. Ironically, it was also a budget choice for me due to the fact that 3080ti's are selling well above this on the aftermarket and third-party vendors are selling their 3080ti's for the same if not more expensive so it was an easy choice for me to get this card since I have the intention to water-cool it at some point.<br /><br />Performance - it is the top of the top, the only knock is the temps under high load so what I recommend is buying new thermal pads and replacing them (I Used Thermalright Extreme Oddesey 1.5mm) for more efficient cooling. It is super easy to do and there are tons of videos on how to do it as well. You CANNOT lose your warranty for disassembling the product - so don't fear as this is a relatively easy task to do.<br /><br />Build - I was SHOCKED with how heavy this GPU weighed and it is because it is made VERY WELL. Also, it should be it is $1500! It has caps for all the screws, the fans run really quietly, and generally just feels good to the touch. Being my first reference card ever bought I was blown away with how much better its construction is vs some 3rd party vendors. On a side note, this card is HUGE - it was about 3/4th the size of my G915 Full-size keyboard so make sure your case and PCI slot can fit this as it is a huge and heavy card. Make sure you get a bracket for your motherboard as well to prevent GPU sag. This card does have two white (non-RGB) lights that are either both on or both off, they aren't very bright so if you don't particularly care for them or the color it isn't a big deal as you can only slightly see them through tinted glass.<br /><br />Conclusion- If you can secure this card and afford it, It is the best on the market in the 1400+ range and especially so at MSRP. Bragging rights, frames and a solid-looking card that can blend in with most builds is what you can look forward to. It is super easy to say this is the best card on the market when many can't get it - but if you get the chance to at MSRP I would pull the trigger every single time on this card.",[],B08HR6ZBYJ,B08HR6ZBYJ,AFF75WQS2FVDI53VPVZNKSU525IQ,2023-02-12 07:07:18.043,0,False,507
406481,4,Works great! But beware during installation…,"This screen protector was one of the first that I found on Amazon that specifically called out being compatible with the new Canon R50 (released 3/16/23). I figured I would give it a shot and see how it went. Overall I feel like it will provide plenty of protection for the touchscreen. And with the R50, you will likely be using the touchscreen more often then with other mirrorless cameras.<br />I am no stranger to installing screen protectors as I have them on just about every device I own with a screen, even the touchscreen in our car! Installation of this screen protector was no different and went on just as you would expect. The kit comes with everything you need to install the three screen protectors, including the wet and dry wipes, “dust-absorber” and guide stickers, and as a bonus, they even threw in a hot shoe plug with a bubble level. All of this was in a nice plastic storage case.<br />However, the installation was not a flawless experience due to the quality of the wipes and stickers. The wet and dry wipes left a hazy residue on the screen that I had to go back and re-clean with isopropyl alcohol and a microfiber cloth. The “dust-absorber” stickers also had extremely strong adhesive that stuck completely to my camera screen, and again left a stick residue that had to be cleaned off with alcohol and a microfiber cloth. I would recommend not using these included items to begin with, and just use your own solution and cloth prior to installing the screen protector.<br />When the screen protector is installed, it fits the screen very nicely and has a nice feel to it. It also seems to resist fingerprints a little better than the original coating on the camera screen itself. The only thing I have noticed is that when you rotate the screen inwards and close it down, it does now sit slightly higher than the rest of the camera body. It still is held in place, so I do not see this as being a big issue, but it is something to be aware of.<br />Overall, I highly recommend this screen protector but time will tell how well it holds up in the long run. If anything major changes or I feel like I need to change my rating and I will update this post. Five stars for the quality of the screen protector, but taking off one star due to the added work required if you use the included materials to prepare your screen.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kkp0V5AzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kkp0V5AzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kkp0V5AzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-6PBA9OXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-6PBA9OXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-6PBA9OXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71AkXvlvBPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71AkXvlvBPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71AkXvlvBPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IPeGV6aKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IPeGV6aKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IPeGV6aKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81u1oKFMwgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81u1oKFMwgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81u1oKFMwgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BXSGMQW9,B0BXSGMQW9,AGF77JIBIRUIQLIHJ45WKPXU5QDQ,2023-03-25 18:55:53.336,1,True,507
69625,5,"Highly stylish, and fits like a perfect glove","I tried seven different cases for my RX 10 IV, and this is by far my favorite. I also use two other of the cases occasionally when I need more room.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1- very compact and fits perfectly.<br />2- really easy to use. Very quick access to camera as needed.<br />3- really easy to put the camera way after use.<br />4- incredibly well designed, and made. A feast for the eyes.<br />5- a quick release plate can be screwed into the bottom of the case, but you do need one that will go off center.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1- will not accommodate a polarizer on the lens, nor an L bracket or quick release plate on the camera.<br />2- no room to store any extras.<br />3- a quick release plate screwed into the bottom of the case will not be very secure. The camera will easily rotate and so the plate can come loose fairly easily. And if you tighten it too tight, the case screw will come off with the plate and it’s a pain to separate them.<br /><br />The cons don’t bother me because they help allow its very compact size which I really appreciate. I can carry extras in my vest or coat pocket.<br /><br />I like this much better than the far more expensive Sony case for the RX 10. That case is hard to use, although it is lovely and does allow an L bracket on the camera and a polarizer on the lens. But it is also bigger. The biggest negative is how difficult it is to get the camera out and use it. And then put the camera away. Most unpleasant.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I ordered a second one on March 6. It arrived March 10 from Turkey. Amazing! I wanted a second one because they are so beautifully made.<br /><br />I tried the one made by Sony for the RX 10 IV, and have found now that it is quite easy to use. It will also accept an L bracket on the camera, and a circular polarizer on the lens. It’s not nearly as stylish as this leather one, but I often use the L bracket and the polarizer so this will now probably get more use than the leather one here. However, I will use this leather one when I don’t think I need the L bracket .",[],B01GW8AL3O,B01GW8AL20,AFOBHMCFWS6L6XH2WF25G4R5ULTQ,2023-03-06 15:25:49.899,0,True,507
235463,2,Yuk...,"I have some 20 year old computer speakers that have been decent (standard two speakers, no sub, I probably paid $30 for them back then?) but I wanted to try this one because of the good reviews, less cable clutter, and I thought the sound quality would actually be better.<br /><br />Regarding a wired connection I thought it could do audio from USB but it cannot, it must be 3.5mm. It was super buzzy, lots of humming, noticeably louder buzz than my older speakers. Pretty annoying. I then thought I would try the Bluetooth connection. Buzz is completely gone! But, now there is a very annoying quiet ""pop"" sound every time the speakers go quiet. Thus, if there is no sound coming out of your computer and say you get a notification sound it will have a slight ""pop"" sound once the notification sound ends as if the speakers are being turned off. Super annoying. No way would I use Bluetooth connection for the speaker. Thus all connection methods produce annoying sounds.<br /><br />What about sound quality? I would say it's easily well below average. If all you need is for sound to come out of your computer and don't care one bit about sound quality, especially music, then it is just fine for that. But the music sound quality is pretty bad honestly. Very hollow and tinny sounding, no real bass to speak of. This is probably due to the speakers being pretty small and so you can only expect so much out of something this small. So I can't really fault this too much. Also there is no sense of ""surround"" sound at all. It very much sounds like it's coming only from where the speakers are directly at. Below your ears and directly forward. My older speakers are spaced maybe 1 to 1.5 feet to the side of my ears and it sounds miles better in terms of surround sound both vertically and horizontally.<br /><br />The sound quality would have been enough for me to want to return this soundbar. But the buzzing and popping noises coming out of it were enough for me to decide to return it before even listening to the sound quality. I will either be returning back to my old speakers or maybe looking elsewhere for a better soundbar.<br /><br />For everyone else, if you aren't annoyed by these noises and don't really care about sound quality then these might be a good cheap set of speakers that have minimal footprint and minimal cables on your desk.",[],B0BQ32XK6C,B0BQ32XK6C,AHOEY3RM2SXLGYNQ6US5HKMWZIGA,2023-03-31 14:19:18.611,0,True,507
211824,3,"Underwhelming, Asus seems to have something to hide","So, I bought this router because I needed a WiFi 6 capable router for VR streaming (I had an ancient WiFi 4 router before). I also planed on having a proper home network and building a set of hardware for it.<br /><br />It was ok-ish when I bought it about 2 years ago, however, it is very underwhelming now. Though, I do realize that the price-range of this router might be too low to be considered high-end.<br /><br />Just to give people a heads up, the AX3000 has very underwhelming hardware for the price. It has a 3 core CPU (I have a feeling that they are all chips with either defects or didnt pass QC with 1 core disabled, an odd number of cores is a major red flag for that). The CPU is somewhat underwhelming, along with the amount of RAM being very underwhelming as well. It may be able to handle a rather normal home situation where there are a couple PCs, phones, and smart devices quite well, but the moment you start moving into power user territory, it begins to fall apart. Just go to the official ASUS site and look at the page for this router. If you compare it to some of their really nice stuff, you can see that its suspiciously missing its information about the CPU.<br /><br />I get stuttering occasionally when trying to wirelessly stream with my VR headset, and I do see that my software automatically limits my bandwidth to anywhere between 70-100mb/s when the max should be 150mb/s (I am more than able to push that with my system, it is a 5800X3D + 32GB of 3600mhz CL16 with a 4090 on a X570 chipset).

I live near the coast where things tend to rust if they aren’t made not to, so waterproof seemed like a good thing.<br /><br />They work properly and sound like real speakers instead of tinny like most Bluetooth speakers.  The battery life has been excellent for me - I’ve used them roughly 8 hours at full volume with the lights flashing and they till show to be almost fully charged.  The size is a bit smaller than the advertising pictures suggest, and the party lights aren’t as bright as they imply but I’m the only one dancing in the shop anyway!<br /><br />Sound quality is really good, actually. Even my 20-something kids (years old, not how many kids!) were impressed and tried to steal my speakers for their rooms.  As some have said, they aren’t INCREDIBLY loud but for me they fill the building sufficiently loudly to be heard plenty clearly over drills and general noise.  I like a LOT of bass and they again do better than any BT speaker I’ve ever found, but there’s only so much boom you can get from a 3” speaker.  I put one inside and empty steel cabinet with the doors open to see if it would enhance the bass - it does!  Too much, actually. Makes it sound muddy.

776488,5,Security monitoring for anyone at a low price.,"While this camera may not have exactly the features that you want, when tested against the features described in the manual I have to give it a high rating.  When you consider that this is one of the lowest-priced devices of this class out there and it includes a solar panel that allows completely wireless operation, it is hard to beat.<br /><br />I have tested every function described in the manual for this camera (except for subscription cloud storage) and everything works as advertised.  It should be noted that pan and tilt, video, and audio are all a little sluggish or delayed, but I have not run into any WiFi camera of this type in this price range that is not.  The Android app also has some occasional quirks and lags, but again, compared to a few other systems that I have tested I find this to be the best.<br /><br />The video is quite sharp with good color rendition under daylight or even flood-lit night conditions.  Under very low light conditions the camera switches to monochrome and opens its internal IR filter to make it sensitive to the built-in IR LED illumination.  The monochrome night vision sensitivity is very good.  The pan and tilt controls have adjustable speeds, but given that there is a delay between pressing a direction button and the actual movement I tend to keep the speed setting on low to prevent overshooting. Digital zoom is like any other with a limited resolution camera - don't expect much usable enhancement.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that these WiFi cameras by different manufacturers really don't have any standardization that could make them work together or as part of a central software-based monitoring system.  Different camera manufacturers have their own software apps, and some are good and others are terrible.  This particular camera is well suited to monitoring a remote area that is without power, although the solar panel will only support intermittent operation-upon-detection and not continuous recording and lighting.  And if you are out of WiFi range it does record to its internal memory card, but you will need to retrieve the card to review any events.<br /><br />The portability and true cordless option with the solar panel makes this well-suited to setting up wherever you currently have a need, whether it be watching for porch package or catalytic converter thieves, mailbox bashers, or nefarious acts by neighbors from hell.<br /><br />I believe this to be a good deal for the price.",[],B0BN4CR6KW,B0BN4CR6KW,AH4K2USV745EQMXZRXSPAPSVHWAA,2023-03-16 14:21:12.542,0,False,507
678041,4,Spacious and Good for Travelling,"This is a good backpack for frequent travelers when you need to pack stuff for your frequent trips and always be on the move. This provides plenty of room for apparel and other items such as a laptop, brush, razors, shaving kit, toiletries, and so on. It comes with two inner net zippers that can hold tiny items conveniently in place. Two front pockets where you can hold your travel documents like passport, air tickets, etc. The large front pocket has enough space to hold a 17-inch laptop. The bigger inner compartment, as you would expect, has a center elastic band to keep clothing in place. It can sufficiently hold stuff for 3 days just fine, and if you need some additional room, you can expand it by an additional 2 inches in height with exterior expandable zippers. It comes with a USB 2.0 powerbank adaptor, which is useful when I want to attach my powerbank, which stays inside securely and charges my phone from the outside. Bag seems water repellent. Four-sided buckles are perfect for keeping this securely and tightly packed. This is all good stuff.<br />Overall, this is decent backpack and can be given a try.<br /><br />There are a few drawbacks and improvements that would make it an ideal travel backpack:<br />1. It comes with only one mesh pocket, and that too on the other side, where there is no USB outlet. It would have been nice to have another mesh pocket near the USB outlet so I could easily attach my phone and keep it in the mesh pocket. 2. I didn't find any of the zippers lockable as advertised. Also, only the zippers in the main compartment may be lockable somehow, but for sure not the zipper where I would keep my laptop or other electronic stuff. 3. There is no padding in the area to keep the laptop secure. 4. The advertised front picture on the listing is not what I got. I got different front pockets than shown in the picture. 5. Zippers at the corners seem to be skipping the zip teeth, which would eventually cause the zips to fail with frequent use. 6. There is a back pocket zipper right under the breathable mesh padding that doesn't seem very useful, in my opinion, and would be highly inconvenient when you hold the backpack on your back. I would rather not keep anything in there and keep it fully breathable, as seems to be the idea from the manufacturer.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61l5gIg+7wL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61l5gIg+7wL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61l5gIg+7wL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719LsNSkKIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719LsNSkKIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719LsNSkKIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ImISfsHfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ImISfsHfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ImISfsHfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vksJ+59TL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vksJ+59TL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vksJ+59TL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BLNBM2TL,B0BS8NSZ3Z,AHUSXMSK2J3JV3KYTMMIPM2GWVDQ,2023-03-19 21:12:24.204,0,False,507
247165,4,"Decent, But Not Professional","I ordered this as a backup tripod when stability is not as important as size.<br /><br />First, the plusses,  This tripod is nicely finished.  It is smooth and has no chips, dings, or sharp protrusions.  One of the legs detaches and can be used as a monopod.  You can remove the ball head from the tripod and attach it to the monopod.  You can also remove the entire center column and attach it to the monopod.  In terms of height, with the legs and center column fully extended, your camera will be sitting nearly 80 inches off the ground.  The angle of the legs is adjustable, with three different presets.  Set to their largest angle, the bottom of the tripod will be about 4 inches off the ground and the camera will be about 2 feet off the ground.  The locks for extending the legs are easy to operate and hold the legs very securely.  The center column can be inverted.  The tripod comes with 2 generic Arca Swiss type plates for mounting onto your camera, a mount for a cell phone, a carrying case, a couple of allen wrenches, a user manual, and a warranty card.<br /><br />Now for the negatives.  The ball head is very basic.  There is a single lock, so getting the camera completely level can be a challenge.  Also, the ball head is pretty small, and you can't expect to use this tripod with a heavy DSLR or a camera with a heavy telephoto attached.  The center column suffers from an issue common to inexpensive tripods.  That is, it wobbles slightly from side to side.  This issue is worse when the column is extended.  Locking the center column after extending it with a camera attached is cumbersome because you need to hold the camera with one hand while tightening the center column with the other,<br /><br />If you don't own a tripod, and you don't need to mount a heavy camera, this tripod might be good enough for you.  It's a cut above the typical ""cheap"" tripod in terms of both versatility and finish.  But if you want to attach a prosumer level DSLR, a medium format or larger film camera, or a mirrorless with a long lens, you'll need to bite the price bullet and spend 2 to 3 times the cost of this tripod for an entry level ""pro"" tripod.",[],B0BJPMRFKC,B0BJPMRFKC,AEBE2MSZ5WBXECIZW22C5GTT6ZLA,2023-01-02 23:09:20.804,0,False,507
117796,2,SoundPeats Failing Quality / DONT UPDATE EARBUDS VIA APP,"I'd like to begin this with saying that I got introduced to SoundPeats by a Kickstarter of there's for the TrueEngine 2s and that I'm a Kickstarter backer for both the TrueEngine 2s and the H1s.<br /><br />And that to this day those TrueEngine 2s still work and sound amazing if not a little quiet. Unlike the H1s.<br /><br />I own both the TrueEngine 2s and the H1s (2 Sets of H1). I also own the Truegine 3 SEs.<br /><br />Out of those four, the only set that works are the TrueEngine 2s.<br /><br />The true engine threes both work. however, for some reason their drivers have made it so that they only max out at 50% volume. I've checked it on both my computer and my phones and they confirms that they have a driver error.<br /><br />I've also checked on my H1s that they also have driver errors. on both sets of h1s I own the left side is significantly quieter than the right side. I would say the left side is at about 40% volume compared to the 100% of the right side.<br /><br />I've gone through support for this and that's why I own two sets of H1. That's cause my first set came from the kickstarter and it developed that problem after the update. I then got the new set to replace it from Support and it worked fine at the beginning. Then it got updated and now it's broken too.<br /><br />So out of H1 Premium (Kickstarter),  H1 (Replacement, TrueEngine 3 SE, and TrueEngine 2s (Kickstarter). The only one that works fully are the TrueEngine 2s. The oldest earbuds out of them all. Though the paint has begun chipping paint due to age and use. The other 3 sets have no proper reason to fail besides poor Quality Control and Drivers.<br /><br />They sound great and have amazing features and latency. When they work that is. Now they're just pretty pebbles I own.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I should go back to support because it's been a while and the fact that if I go back to support I just might get another broken product.

I received mine within a few days of ordering (I think it was supposed to be 2 day, there was a delay, and I got it in 3 ... but still). Admittedly, I didn't get it working immediately, and I emailed the support. They responded within 24 hours, and I had a second questions and they responded again within 24 hours. They provided PDF of installation manuals. The thing I had missed is that CANBUS didn't exist last time I installed a car stereo and didn't know what it was and didn't know it was required and essential. It is. And that's not really clarified in the manual. But it really is 'plug and play' -- click in the Power Harness (it is 100% obvious where both ends of this go) and click in CANBUS DECODER onto the CANBUS Harness, and again once you know this is needed it obvious what to do, and it powers on works perfectly. Apparently the CANBUS allows all sorts of specifications with your model, so for example, when I turn my headlights on or off, it impacts the illumination of the radio -- it is amazingly tailored. The ZLink application works 100% and needed no set-up on my Android phone. I'm a bit of an audiophile, or so I fancy myself, and have Amazon Music HD tracks [192Hz and 24bit] downloaded to my phone. I use the wired Android Auto feature, and as you can see in the photos I attached, it streams through the USB cable Hi-Rez to the amplifier. Speaking of, at 4x 45Watts, it isn't the blaringly loud, but plenty loud enough for me, and if you want more, you can add an aftermarket applifier and have even better fidelity and still amazing value. The sound I get is crystal clear. Plus, all the features of an Android 11 tablet. My Google maps and calendar and messenger all integrated seamlessly without my having to do a thing. And, for goodness sake, it comes with the frame which I had practically zero issues installing. I feel like I'm driving a high-end custom install. Could not be happier, and at less than $200, I'm blown away. You can't even get a ""regular"" car stereo for that these days, let along an over-sized 10"" tablet screen and frame.

I tried old school Walkman skinny type headset- using everything but duct tape and bubble gum to MacGyver a secure fit.. it was a total bust!!

I have just x1 bud left! Getting a realistic design compatible for kiddos wiggles is a must- just like this has. Offered at a respectable price.. is icing on the cake!<br /><br />Ear cushions like tiny “donut pillows” plume outward the so no hard plastic presses against ear.. comfort’s what brings a toddler to forget device is even there! Ergonomic style cups also keep the sound from escaping.. ideal if you can’t tolerate another round of “baby shark or cocomelon” sing-along x1 more time!<br /><br />Volume feature is brilliant with a safety level it place, it cant get dialed up to harm eardrums.. and yet still able to deliver respectable sound quality!

488289,5,A quality filter with a thin rim - particularly suitable for use on ultra-wide angle lenses,"The filter I received (NiSi 77mm UV filter) fits the product description and my basic expectations - a coated UV filter with an extra-thin rim.<br /><br />I can't readily verify the claims of an ""ultra hard coating"" (more resistant against scratching) and ""double-sided nano coating"" (repels water and dust, so the filter stays clean longer). But I can see that it has anti-reflection coatings, as expected in any quality photographic filter.<br /><br />The mechanical machining of the rim, including the thread, looks very good; it easily and smoothly screwed onto my Canon L lens. <br /><br />I measured the rim thickness with a digital caliper - 3.56mm. This is indeed thinner than a typical/traditional 77mm filter rims. (For example, a brand-name Japanese 77mm UV filter I just checked was ~4.70mm thick.) And this makes this filter particularly suitable for use on ultra wide angle lenses that can be prone to vignetting.<br /><br />(Vignetting: The darkening of image corners due to partial blocking of light rays, that could be caused by using a filter (or multiple filters) having a thick rim. Actually, however, most brand-name lenses are designed with filter use in mind, so this shouldn't be a problem on most lenses. But slim filters have become increasingly common in recent years, mostly because filter manufacturers can use it as a point of product differentiation from competitors - not so much because it's so necessary or better.)<br /><br />In terms of value, lately I am seeing more and more exorbitantly overpriced photography filters on Amazon - some costing more than a brand-name camera lens! In the sea of crazy expensive filters, this product appears to be a little more sensibly priced.  And I like that about this product.<br /><br />Overall I have no complaints. So I am giving it 5 stars.<br /><br />(Personally, though, I have come to prefer a Japanese Hoya filter or a German B+W filter over the years. It doesn't mean others are bad.

177731,5,"Very responsive, easy to use after a few days learning and adapting","Context is probably needed:<br /><br />Post carpal tunnel surgery, developed tendonitis - ulnar deviation, not flexion - so moving a normal mouse on the surface of a mousepad side to side was very painful. I also have Rheumatoid Arthritis and other trackball mice had such stiff buttons I had difficulty clicking the buttons.<br /><br />The Relacon mouse is not perfect, but it has enabled me to do dragging and dropping (photos in MS Publisher). On 'normal' mice, dragging and dropping requires continuous pressing down of the Right mouse button and moving the position of the entire mouse. With the Relacon mouse, a very light pressure with the middle finger and gentle very minute movement of my thumb on the trackball will move and item. You do have to learn to be still when hovering the mouse (using the trackball) cursor over an item and waiting for the + to indicate that the mouse can select the object. I found that this took the most time to adjust to when using the Relacon mouse. With 'normal' mice you can click and grab an item more quickly - but only a split second more quickly.<br /><br />I haven't yet used the adjustable settings on the Relacon mouse, but so far after several weeks using it - at a distance of 10ft from a large screen and also at a normal distance from my desktop computer - the mouse (in combination with a tented split keyboard) has allowed my wrist inflammation to disappear almost completely.<br /><br />I don't know if anyone else reading this would want to know this, but I searched everywhere and this was the ONLY mouse that allows you to move objects without moving your whole mouse on a mousepad while allowing you to maintain an ergonomic position (45 degree angle as you would see on a vertical mouse).<br /><br />The only downside to the Relacon design is that if you have issues where you need to keep your wrist flexion neutral (to avoid carpal tunnel syndrome) and avoid ulnar deviation, you have to rigourously train yourself to hold the Relacon mouse in the correct position. I did this by propping my hand holding the Relacon mouse on my upper thigh at the right angle and then I leave it there in a relaxed position.

478993,5,A WINNER THAT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE AN ESSENTIAL  - UNTIL YOU TRY IT!,"Who knew a small bit of blue silicone could be so life-changing?<br /><br />NEVER LOSE YOUR ROKU REMOTE AGAIN!<br />1) It's blue! (Or your choice of color) You can see it and find it in the darkest of rooms.<br />2)  Non-slip grip keeps the remote where you left it.  No more sliding into the couch cushions or off the bedcovers.<br /><br />BUT THE BEST PART---<br /><br />No more ""Random Netflixing"" in the middle of whatever you're watching because you ""picked up the remote the wrong way.""  For YEARS I have grumbled about the branded hot buttons on the Roku remote.  Yes, that sponsorship probably keeps the cost down on the units, but HOW MANY TIMES have I made an awkward grab for the remote to pause a movie on one channel and magically found Netflix or Hulu randomly loading because I accidentally hit the button?  TOO MANY.<br /><br />Well NO MORE!  The design of this remote sleeve is raised around the hot buttons, so since I've installed it, an errant grab has yet to load a service I was most definitely not watching and not wanting to watch.  That alone would make this remote wrap worth the price, but it's also saved me at least an hour so far of life in not having to look for it.  I'm sold!<br /><br />Note on installing wristband:<br />It will be easier if you nudge a paper clip into hole #2 to grab the string you insert into hole #1.  I wondered if the strap was really necessary, but it's been very handy to hang the remote off a nightstand knob when I change the sheets on the bed.  Also, if you game with your Roku remote, will keep you from inadvertently flinging it across the room.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />This product falls into one of those ""Do I really need it?"" categories for me, but I've been over the moon with the conveniences.  It has solved a lot of minor gripes for me that makes life a little easier, and who doesn't need that nowadays?<br /><br />Would make a great gift for someone who thinks they don't need it!

539828,5,Works for Me,"My CD player broke, so I decided to rip all my CDs to .flac files to an external drive and play  them through Sonos.  The ripping went fine after a short learning curve, but Sonos had all kinds of trouble recognizing the drive and I finally resorted to running it thru a Roku 3 (using the USB port) with HDMI to the TV and an optical cable from the TV to to a Yamaha S301 integrated amp hooked up to Wharfdale speakers.<br /><br />Everything worked fine, but the sound wasn't right, actually fatiguing in hour or more sessions. (I am a painter and rely on the music as background and during breaks.) During this time I listened much more to vinyl and that was obviously part of the reason I was having difficulty appreciating the digital sound feed.  The Sonos was now working, but spotty, so I was pretty much relegated to the USB thru Roku.<br /><br />So, after researching DACs, including those in the Yamaha and the Sonos Connect, and including all those who say there is no real difference between DACs, I decided to try one and settled on the Modi 3E.<br /><br />Wow. There is no question that the sound is much improved; much better than I anticipated. Sonos is now fixed and I decided to try running that thru the DAC as well. Noticeable improvement. This system has never sounded this good to me. I really look forward to my listening  sessions. It is just great.<br /><br />Setup is: (for playing from USB  stick or drive) Roku 3 (USB Port w USB Stick) HDMI>TV Optical Cable>Modi 3E RCA>Yamaha S301 RCA> Sonos Connect<br />...and (for Sonos connection) Synology Router USB Port with Seagate 2TB External Drive; Sonos Connect Digital Cable>Modi 3E (with RCA to S301 and RCA from S301 to Sonos Connect)<br /><br />The difference is notable enough to me that  I started thinking about how much better could it get.  But even if the next level DAC would make a noticeable next level improvement, for now that's irrelevant. The sound I have is great. I don't need to improve it. I enjoy it and really don't  think I need to make any more changes. The Modi 3E was a great decision.",[],B09RCZW5WY,B09RCZW5WY,AG5ZN7MIXXM37WLG64KXXKDL2NKA,2023-03-21 03:41:02.819,2,True,506
685779,1,It works... barely.,"I just decided to test my new unit and was hit by a bit of a surprise. It says I should be able to get 11 mins at half load and 2.5 mins at full load. I'm at 1/4 load (250w) and my ""Estimated Runtime"" and ""Battery Capacity"" dropped from 29 min. and 100% to 10 min. and 43% in under a minute. My system wouldn't have even have been able to fully shut down in that 30 seconds or so I had remaining. Now I have to wait a few hours for it to charge just to be able to attempt to test ""Preserve Battery Power"" as the ""Keep Computer Running"" option mins out at ""5 minutes"" which, by my math here is about 15 seconds, if I'm lucky.<br /><br />I saw a bunch of reviews of people being pissed about getting a used unit, I made sure mine was not, but it functions like a used unit on it's last days as far as my initial test would suggest. The only reason this is getting 2 stars is because my system did stay powered on for a minute or so and the app actually seems to work. Though, as I said before, I haven't been able to fully test the ""Runtime Configuration"" options yet. I will update if anything changes, but I don't anticipate they will.<br /><br />Update: So, I set it to ""Preserve Battery Power"" and toggled it to ""0 minutes"" so that when power goes out my system immediately shuts down, leaving the absolute most amount of time for my system to shut down, in case something went wrong. I unplugged the UPS, forcing it into battery mode to test it and see what it does and if it will work in the event of a power outage. Yes, it effectively shut down my computer, but it seems to have borked my BIOS. I'm assuming it has something to do with the fact that the power, according to two different independent YouTubers who tested this exact device, is in fact, NOT a pure sine wave, but rather an odd stepped version of it. Now my RAM profile is disabled and I can't get into my BIOS at all. My system had no issues shutting down and turning back on on normal wall power, but being plugged into this thing has just cut my overall RAM performance by 1/3 and made it to where I can't fix it.",[],B00429N19W,B0B4QS4F25,AHQGO3YPOXTIOHIXK3P3IGQUM7GQ,2023-03-09 22:43:01.347,0,True,506
822778,4,Straight Up AWESOME 👍 Worth the price,"****Some quick updates!!!<br /><br />The phone call feature works great. I was able to accept calls, the caller could hear me without a problem, and I could hear them fine. All those features work as expected.<br /><br />BUT....now, I do have to say, I put music on the device to play back, and this feature does not work at all. Therefore, I gotta deduct a star for that issue.<br /><br />Still though, the blue tooth connects to my phone so I can listen to my music on the go that way, or if at home, on my laptop, etc. Overall, a super product for the price e range. 👍<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW ****<br /><br />I was lucky enough to get a chance to test and review these Bone Conduction headphones through the Amazon Vine Voice program.<br /><br />These are FANTASTIC 😊<br /><br />Wow!! I had no idea this type of headphones even existed. They came nicely boxed, and they are soooooo simple to use. And, yes, they truly take 1 hour to charge (as advertised), then these are incredibly simple to pair with any device. I decided to use these headphones for running so I paired them with my phone, but you could pair them with other devices, laptops, etc.<br /><br />Next, wow, the comfort is spectacular. They stay in place, and you don't even notice them. Not to mention, the bone conduction setup means you don't have to shove ear buds in your ear canal, which is great for better hygiene, ear health, and safety because you can still hear what's happening around you.<br /><br />Honestly, I wish I would have found something like this years ago. These are totally worth the cost, and I love using them. AWESOME PRODUCT 😁👍👍👍<br /><br />Oh!! And, being waterproof/water-resistant is super helpful because my last run was in storm conditions so they performed great plus there is no latency in my music, and the controls are easy to access as well.<br /><br />Please note, I did not use them for phone calls so that is a feature I still need to test. I will say, even without trying that - I couldn't be happier with using these for my runs.",[],B0BS93LJ8X,B0BS8RPM5D,AG3W2TKTA44A6RST3VBKHWUPFG2Q,2023-03-08 21:45:53.383,0,False,506
60919,5,"We LOVE our ALEXAS, Own 3 and gifted 3!!","We love so much all our Alexa’s. We have a 3rd gen, two 4th gens and 4th gen with clock and now a 5th gen as a gift. All white and charcoal. They are amazing. So helpful when needed, we listen to music daily via pandora or Amazon everyday. Great for homework or instant questions. Got this for my father whom is a doctor working from a home office via telemedicine. This was perfect for him for any questions he may have. He also bought a Samsung QLED smart TV which works with Alexa and I thought this would help him navigate how to use the television more easily. We haven’t hooked anything up just yet, but excited too. The charcoal is nice coloring for his office too. So many possibilities. I have mine in LR  with smart Amazon plug which turned on off my Xmas tree. Will be getting more plugs too. So many possibilities sky is the limit. Love the payment options as well gives an opportunity to get multiple at once as gifts. Also gifted one to my Neice last year the gen white 4 and she loves it,  got same for my brother too . Amazing for all ages. Literally we are 8-78yrs. So compact easy to display. Modern looking. Picks up commands well. Gives weather if requested. Download app to make all your preferences easy and personalize it to just you.  Responds to your voice command. Name it with the small choices it gives. We have an Echo, Alexa, and a Ziggy… we chose different names for our home so when we command her they all don’t go off at once. We set reminders and errand lists.  I do wish they gave more naming options for this purpose but we are lucky we have enough names for the amount owned. We love them. It’s a cool device and everyone should have one! Makes life so easy at times. The pictures listed are of my white gen 4 clock choice but the gen 5 charcoal looks the same just diff color (this gen 5 doesn’t have clock option) . I believe it’s the software that separates the two. Wanted to give you a picture of what would look like. Connect to your Amazon account and will notify you when your packages come, and any updates regarding your account. As you see mine is lit yellow at the base stating I have a notification. Sound quality is amazing.

20782,5,Almost my favorites of 2022,"While I didn't try every higher end earbud that came out in 2022, these ranked 2nd among those I tried (including releases from Sony, Jabra, Bang and Olufsen, OnePlus, and more). The top spot went to the Bang and Olufsen EX (super pricey at $400, but the sound quality is just the best of everything I tried, and they're also quite comfortable for extended use). The Free Byrd from Beyerdynamic ranked slightly lower on sound and comfort. That said, they may have your preferred sound profile, and at their current price, they're a much easier sell than when they first came out. For the rest of the review, I'll break them down by a few areas I think are important.<br /><br />Sound quality - 9/10. Excellent detail, but no matter how you tweak the sound in the app, they tend toward the warm side. If you set it to a v-shaped sound profile, it's a bit too warm and bass heavy for me. Others will completely approve of the sound, however. It's definitely among the best I've heard, but I like the slightly more neutral but still warm B&O.<br /><br />Comfort - 7/10. These are big earbuds. They protrude from your ears more than others will. They fit generally well, but they are slightly more prone to falling out of place or needing adjustment. It's not a huge issue for me, but if you have small ears, you'll likely struggle with these.<br /><br />ANC - 7.5/10. Good ANC, but nowhere near the industry leaders Sony and Bose. It's not even as good as my Jabras. It is, however, better than the B&Os, and these earbuds are half the price of those. If ANC is important to you, these may not be quite good enough, but it's not bad.<br /><br />Other features - 8/10. You've got most of the standards. Ear detection (which I don't like), a competent app that does some personalized sound, etc.<br /><br />Overall, these are great, and much easier to recommend at under $200 than at $250, the price at release. If you really want to splurge on the best for sound, I still like the B&O EX better, but those are so pricey...",[],B0B4KKFGBV,B0B4KKFGBV,AGEG5UCY42IYI2H4J5X5XNDZPENA,2023-01-10 02:25:55.527,3,False,506
373,5,The best at a great price!,"I've used this device for several days now. There's so much to like about it.<br /><br />The design: awesome and solid! Because of my vehicle's cigarette lighter placement, I wasn't sure if this device would fit. It easily fit perfectly. It swivels so you can easily tilt it like you want it. Everything you want it to do is easily found and visually attractive.<br /><br />The physical look and feel: again, VERY solid. The part of the device that swivels is strong and not at all flimsy. The bass and treble wheels...absolutely solid and easy to adjust. (I love the bass/treble wheel feature.) This device is definitely well made.<br /><br />The layout: exactly what I would want. The digital display (that shows which radio station it's tuned to) is sized right so I don't have to squint. The placement allows for a quick glance. The ""volume wheel"" is sized correctly so you don't have to fumble around to find it whilst driving. The equalizer lights are to the right where they should be. The controlling wheels are closer to the driver, right where they should be.<br /><br />The features: whoever designed this device knew what they were doing. It's feature-packed yet simple enough to set up and operate that I still haven't read the instructions. I love being able to skip to the previous or next song from the device instead of my phone, which is a convenient feature and also one of driving safety if you think about it. The volume wheel is sized well and easy to locate by feel without having to look for it. Besides volume, it also controls answering a call among other things. What most impressed me about it is how much it will do while remaining simple to operate. The dedicated bass and treble wheels: again, they are solid and textured: very easy to use. I didn't think I would use the bass/treble wheels that much but I have. What it wound up doing was making the tunes sound better. Having that feature allows you to adjust the sound of the songs you're streaming without having to change your car radio's sound which is awesome.<br /><br />The price: perfect, considering what all this device will do and how solidly it's made.<br /><br />I've used a ton of these things over the years and this one is by far the best.",[],B0BRXQNWF3,B0C9ZH3NPJ,AER6ABZ6SFJNWVQFAO7HXX656WQA,2023-02-24 18:43:28.298,26,True,506
678048,4,"Great Trendy Keyboard That Works, Battery Life Might Be of Concern","This is a great keyboard that serves its purpose. It's definitely trendy and looks awesome with those 3 different modes of lighting: - Rainbow effect, Monochrome light that stays, and Ripple mode which will flash light on each key stroke when typing. These modes are activated by pressing the M1, M2, and M3 keys on the keyboard. There is also a light in the mouse that changes color at random and is controlled by the center button. Keyboard light or backlit can be turned off completely, but this can't be done with mouse light.<br /><br />Keyboard light can be adjusted, but even at the lowest settings, it's very bright, and that won't be ideal for working in a completely dark room with others trying to sleep. This keyboard and mouse both have a very shallow form factor, and it's a membrane-based keyboard. I'm not very fond of typing on that kind of keyboard and mouse. That's a personal preference, but yes, it's indeed very quiet when I type on this, and that's good.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Cool and Trendy: Color combinations on keyboard are just awesome and can add a bit of fashion to your game room or home office.<br /><br />2. Quiet typing: When typing, the keyboard is very quiet, so you can write those long emails without worrying about annoying anyone with that typewriter sound.<br /><br />3. Feels Sturdy: Both the mouse and keyboard have that rugged feel that suggests they would last longer.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Smaller Battery and Longer Charge Time: The keyboard has 1600 mAh and the mouse has 650 mAh. Even with this smaller size, it takes a long time to charge. Charging time is 8 hours and 3 hours for the keyboard and mouse, respectively. With this small battery, I did expect a lot faster charge time.<br /><br />2. Battery Drains Fast and Mouse Wakeup Time: I did observe that the mouse battery drains pretty quickly, and the mouse takes a bit to wake up. The keyboard seems to be working perfectly fine, both with the battery and wakeup time.<br /><br />3. Slightly Expensive: Other brands of wireless keyboards and mice are available at a lower price and with a larger battery capacity. As a result, this appears to be slightly overpriced for what they offer.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YHn+-i4UL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YHn+-i4UL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YHn+-i4UL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bIdsPQduL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bIdsPQduL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bIdsPQduL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Iwi25pHuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Iwi25pHuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Iwi25pHuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71P3sq16KwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71P3sq16KwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71P3sq16KwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71adrMW-U1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71adrMW-U1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71adrMW-U1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71e+SmlZFzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71e+SmlZFzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71e+SmlZFzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71g2B4L73hL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71g2B4L73hL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71g2B4L73hL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BN7JRVX5,B0CBJZDQCL,AHUSXMSK2J3JV3KYTMMIPM2GWVDQ,2023-01-21 23:41:51.908,3,False,506

The previous still works perfect but I designated that to my work PC and wanted one for the home office.<br /><br />The N940p did not disappoint and I will be keeping it. With the correct lighting, the picture is super clear and crisp, if you are in a poorly lit space you will see film grain as this is not a dslr, it is a webcam and not a super fancy one at that. This being said, I tested it with just natural day light coming through a window on an overcast day and the low light compensation looked great. Then I tested it at night with not a lot of light and the picture was pretty grainy wherever there wasn't light directly on it. And to be fair, I have never came across a webcam at this price point where you don't get film grain in low lighted areas, its a webcam, not a cinema camera. Now in this low light environment I placed a washed out white light behind my monitor to shine on my face and the picture looked pretty good. The included remote was actually one of the main selling points for me, and it works good. Sometimes it is unresponsive but 95% of the time it works perfect. A cool feature is the power button, you can actually turn it off with the remote as well as pan, zoom, mic controls and image flip.<br /><br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars, I left one star off due to a few minor things like the mic quality, the included privacy shutters and the remote responsiveness not being perfect.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who needs a simple webcam for conferencing or video chat, even streaming. But also want the added picture quality and functionality of a zoomable lens and remote control.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51+eAvxVyrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51+eAvxVyrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51+eAvxVyrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6127dr+uMqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6127dr+uMqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6127dr+uMqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61j9BOfyBkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61j9BOfyBkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61j9BOfyBkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61unMycPOBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61unMycPOBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61unMycPOBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LLV+mqFIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LLV+mqFIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LLV+mqFIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0915WSZZ1,B0BN8GYV3H,AE6WAWBQS5NWJEQIATV5N5B5SVDQ,2023-03-06 02:49:20.622,0,True,506
653333,1,It Does It All,"This 17 inch frame replaces my old 10 inch frame (both pictured for size comparison). I really like the picture quality despite it being a large frame there is no loss in detail. You can load your photos by three methods - all three of which are pretty simple as a 29 page User Manual comes with it along with a USB cable for direct transfer from your computer to the Photo Frame. I also like the remote control that comes with it though you can do most everything by touch screen. You can also upload videos (200MB per clip) which I haven't tried and you can upload music as well.<br /><br />UPDATE:  While pushing my second load of photos into the Mini-SD Card slot, the card slid in past the opening and disappeared into the bowels of the picture frame never to return. I can not retrieve it. It's gone inside the frame somewhere. I spent all evening trying everything I could think of to fish out the SD Card but it's gone. I won't return the frame now with my personal SD card floating around inside the frame with 250 of my favorite photos. They are not copyrighted so where would the card end up?  My advise is DO NOT EVER use the Mini-SD Card slot. They can be misaligned and you'll sadly loosed your card and all its photos. BEWARE OF THIS DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING FLAW.<br /><br />UPDATE 2:  My Mini-SD Card finally dropped out thru the enlarged hole I made around the Mini-SD slot in back of the frame while trying to fish out my card. This was while I used the additional USB port with a thumb drive that is located next to the mini slot. The USB port works fine and I have resumed loading my photos thru this port. The good news is - I still think this frame is worth the money and has very good picture definition. Just be very careful when using the Mini-SD Card slot. It is designed to lock your Mini card in place when pushing it into the slot. I don't believe this is a necessary feature as many other products featuring a Mini slot just require you to slip it in - pull out and do not lock your card in place. With this frame you must put additional inward force on the mini card in order to release it back out. In doing this function you can, if not careful, easily push the whole Mini-SD slot deeper into the frame and causing the same problem I had.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CYtc3nMiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CYtc3nMiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CYtc3nMiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71b26gtqrRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71b26gtqrRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71b26gtqrRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B96GV44Q,B0B96GV44Q,AGHDZQAQGVKLQKCU4QPBAQ2OLNKA,2023-01-02 22:11:57.413,6,True,506
717096,5,Great performance and features for the price,"My brief, high-level (TL;DR) assessment of these earbuds is that you really can’t ask for much more, at this price point.  I’ve been using them/getting used to them for about 10 days and have no complaints at all.<br /><br />I’ve had a previous iteration of these (T59) for a few years and really enjoyed them, but the N35s up the game in a number of meaningful ways.  The function controls now include separate (+/-) volume buttons on the top of each earpiece, as well as the usual multifunction buttons (MFBs) on each side.  The buttons are positioned and designed to ensure that tactile location, identification, and operation are never a problem. In addition, the units provide audible cues at all major functionality points (e.g., on, paired, incoming phone call, max volume level).<br /><br />Initial location/pairing with my iPhone SE (3rd-gen.) was a snap, and the connection process each time I use them is seamless and automatic.  Sound quality is great for audio books and as good as could be expected for music (again, in this price range).  Play is automatically suspended and then resumed to accommodate  incoming phone calls (which are also announced).  Phone calls can also be accepted, rejected, and/or disconnected via the MFB.  Carrying on a conversation with them in was trouble-free.<br /><br />The N35 case is definitely heavier than the T59 (by about 54%), but boasts extra functionality as well.  You still get good long battery life and the level read outs for the case (numeric %) and for each earbud (bar graphs), but now the charging case doubles as a charging source, via a standard USB-A port.  While this function is likely not as robust as pure charger bank device, it’s still a great feature to have in a pinch.  The case can recharge either via a USB-C port (cable included) or any wireless inductive charging pad (not included).<br /><br />Of course, they include the standard sets of ear tips (S, M, & L) and have soft, flexible “ear hooks.”  After a little bit of experimentation and usage, I found them to be as comfortable as my old T59s.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/513rbCJOUpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/513rbCJOUpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/513rbCJOUpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SWdLYeyJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SWdLYeyJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SWdLYeyJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LBam9v-JL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LBam9v-JL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LBam9v-JL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7190WB38FrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7190WB38FrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7190WB38FrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WgRaG-dsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WgRaG-dsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WgRaG-dsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YN0LFwyFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YN0LFwyFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YN0LFwyFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kdbdOxvZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kdbdOxvZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kdbdOxvZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BNT1L5GW,B0CF1LQGBM,AHADKPKDNGTKKNHOWU7BXI3CZXJA,2023-03-04 20:12:35.882,14,True,506
790119,3,It is somewhat over specified,"I bought two of these.  After I installed the first one, I was going to give it a 4, but after I got the second one in, I have to lower it to a 3.  Both sets installed with minimal difficulties.  The first set was a 26 inch set weighing 15 lbs and it was mostly easy to install.  The only difficulty I had was that the the drill size that the directions say to use for the pilot holes to mount the unit to a stud is too small.  When I tried to tighten down the screws, it got harder and harder to turn them, and finally one broke off.  I had to go to a hardware store to get more screws.  The second attempt, I moved the unit up about 1/2 inch to clear the remains of the broken screw, drilled pilot holes about two drill sizes larger, and then scraped the screws across a bar of soap to provide some lubrication and everything went as planned.  Then I started on the second TV.  This was a 42 inch set weighing 40 lbs.  That makes it very near, but not over, the upper limits of this unit's specification.  The TV installed with no difficulties but it really is too heavy for this unit.  It feels floppy as you move it around.  If the center of gravity of the TV was very far left or right of the center of the mounting bracket, as one reviewer noted, the TV would just tip over onto it's side. The bolt that is supposed to hold it level (that the directions tell you not to over-tighten in large bold letters, is not up to the job.  Also, if you move the TV as far as it will go to one side, as I did to connect the cables, the unit sags to the point that the swivel axis is tipped over and the TV will just swivel as far as it can go.  Re-leveling it does not help because the weight of the TV is now producing torque around this axis and there is no way to tighten this axis to hold it against this motion.  Again, the unit is not up to the job.  40 lbs is just too much weight for it.  The 44 lb limit is way to high.  I'm not sure that even 30 lbs would feel stable. This unit is fine as long as your TV is light enough and otherwise meets the required specifications but the max weight need to be revised downward.",[],B07SHFPD8S,B07SHFPD8S,AGDV7N6XF3MFQOLXB7OYCBBXUPXA,2023-03-12 04:38:13.545,7,True,506

335945,4,"I had high expectations for this soundbar, but...","First, the things I liked. The soundbar and subwoofer package looks very classy and feels nice and sturdy. The remote allows you to adjust sound and volume, and select input source.<br /><br />In Bluetooth mode, this system sounds fantastic. However, the sound signature is on the bright side, and some songs can sound a bit harsh even with the treble turned all the way down. Some people like a brighter speaker, so this might suit you just fine. And of course, the subwoofer really adds a lot. I tried the unit with and without the subwoofer, and the difference is dramatic.<br /><br />Things that could be better:<br />* Most importantly, there's no HDMI input. Virtually all soundbars these days have HDMI connectivity, so I was surprised that this feature isn't included. When it comes to TV sound quality, the input source definitely affects the sound quality. Ranked from worst to best: USB &lt; RCA &lt; Optical &lt; HDMI. For me, the lack of HDMI is a deal breaker. Using that input type not only gives you superior sound, it also allows you to control most soundbars using the TV's remote instead of needing a separate remote.<br /><br />* I tested TV sound using the RCA input. It sounded very nice, much better than the TV's speakers. But it didn't sound as good as optical (more on that below) or HDMI.<br /><br />* There is an RCA cable and aux cable included, but no optical cable. Similar soundbars in this size (even less expensive systems) include an optical cable, so this was a disadvantage for me.<br /><br />* I wanted to use this soundbar with an older TV. It has an optical cable, but I wasn't able to get sound from the sounbar because the soundbar requires PCM 2.0. My TV offers only Internal Speakers and Audio System. I also couldn't get signal using the aux input, so my only option is the RCA input.<br /><br />My overall impression is that this is a great system when used as a portable sound system, especially with Bluetooth devices. But if you're using this primarily as a soundbar, I think there are better options out there. I would rate this system 3.5 stars, but that's not an option, so I gave it 4 stars.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kV7KvLbiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kV7KvLbiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kV7KvLbiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BKLKJ6FV,B0BZ5C5QNB,AH3WQZCPXLJ4SVLFJWQ2YNRPR7IA,2023-03-15 21:19:46.124,0,False,506

Ignore the instructions. The manual (what supposedly counts for a manual, anyhow) includes links and QR codes to videos showing how to get it to work - these are also garbage. Ignore them. Lastly, there is a tech support-ish website you can visit if everything fails. Guess what?

Make sure the location settings in your phone are turned on, at least for the purpose of installing this thing. Switch it back to ""I don't want the government tracking me at all times"" mode afterward if you like, but make sure it's on when you try to pair it to your app.<br />Step 6.

673889,5,"Pretty good in general, perfect for what I needed","TLDR: sound is pretty good but bass is mushy, not enough highs, noise canceling is ok, volume is plenty loud<br /><br />I had a very specific use in mind, and these headphones are perfect. I do woodworking, and I like to listen to audio books while I work. Unfortunately, regular headphones are drowned out by the constantly running shop-vac and assorted tools. I’m concerned if I turn up the volume loud enough to hear what’s being said over the noise I’ll blow out my hearing.<br /><br />So, after hearing my ex-wife brag about the sound cancelling abilities of her air pods, I decided to give the tech a go. My guess is the noise canceling on these headphones isn’t anywhere near as good as the apple pods, but they also aren’t several hundred dollars. And frankly, I don’t want them to be that quiet - the last thing I need is to forget that the table saw is running. With these headphones, I get: reduced volume from the tools, which is better for my ears, decent enough clarity in sound for audio books, and I can hear the narrator without having to turn up the volume, even when running my Dewalt lunchbox planer that sounds like a jet taking off.<br /><br />I don’t like the sound for music - too bassy, which normally I love, but this bass is pretty mushy. But again - in this price range I give them 5 stars.<br /><br />UPDATE: I’ve been wearing these for a week or so now, and I’ll add a couple of points:<br /><br />They are very comfortable. With my other headsets I usually have to remove them after a couple of hours because they hurt my ears. I leave these on all day.<br /><br />I tested the active noise cancellation against the fan in my bathroom (never mind why I had them on in the bathroom, shut up) and what I found is that turning the ANC on in no way diminishes the volume of the fan, it just sucks the bass end out, probably storing it up to make songs sound mushy later.  I think that’s why it works well for me, as most of my tools (e.g. my Ridgid shop vac) operate in that lower register.",[],B095BV8R27,B0BNV9818Q,AGI5MXWM3FV2BRLIIEHSLZXBC6SQ,2023-03-30 16:55:40.601,10,True,506

Perma Sleep mode issue.,"I had a non Perixx mouse with the exact same vetical clam shell structure which I loved, but the optical sensor did not work on the material of my new bean bag chair (velorish), while other higher end mouses (microsoft & logitech) did.  Thus looking for a new vertical mouse, I found the Perixx mouse and looked at the specs and it had a newer optics sensor with a higher DPI than my much beloved vertical mouse, so I took a flyer on it.  The mouse is idential in form to my existing vertical mouse and worked great on my new bean bag chair.  Besides the internals, the outer shellis identical but with a different logo printed on it to my prevous mouse.  5 stars for the mouse until...<br /><br />After 5 months of use, averaging about 4 hours a day (lots of Visio diagrams), the mouse went into perma sleep mode.  Technically the mouse works, but it goes into sleep mode after 2 seconds of non use.  I am use to some type of sleep mode on wireless mice, you shake them and everthing is good again.  However with a 2 second sleep mode trigger, mouse clicks get eaten because the click is waking up the mouse and then ignored.  Its like typing and having random keys not being typed at all.<br /><br />I bought this mouse from amazon.com vs perixx's amazon store.  Perixx will not honor their 1 year warranty since the item was sold by the seller amazon.com and therefor they cannot verify the amazon invoice via their amazon store tools.<br /><br />Overall this common vertical mouse clam shell has the best feal of any of the 30+ mouse shapes i have tried.  The difference is night and day the mouse is used at waist level or below from a seated position.  I will be purchasing another vertical mouse of this clam shell soon, but I will not be this or any model with an internal battery going forward.<br /><br />Overall I think my experience with mouse warrents 2.5 stars.  I lowered it down to 2 starts since a half star is not allowed.

84112,5,FITS FIRMLY & EASY INSTALL ON A HONDA PIONEER 1000-3 OFF ROAD UTV,"It is not possible nor practical to solidly mount conventional side view mirrors to view behind either side of our 2020 Pioneer 1000.  This is because of fitment of dealer installed OEM Honda accessories including glass windshield, hard roof, hard cab rear panel with glass window and quick mount/remove soft upper door window panels.  The roll over protection frame tube structure is covered, by fitment of the the hard panels and, the hard weatherproofing flashing to seal the upper door soft window closure points at the windshield.  We do not want to cut such accessories to fabricate a way to install conventional side mirrors NOR HAVE SUCH MIRROR PROTRUSIONS BECAUSE OF THE NARROW PATHWAYS IN OUR AND OTHER WOODLAND AREAS.<br /><br />We acquired one of these backup camera systems with the intent to install on our 2012 pickup truck.  We checked to see if we could fit it on the Honda Pioneer and by carefully bending one side of the camera license plate mounting bracket to fit at the top upper corner of the hard rear Pioneer window panel.  We temporarily assembled the camera system, installed the windshield suction cup mount and energized the camera/monitor system.  We found that the camera could be adjusted perfectly to get the rear view we needed for the driver’s side of the Pioneer.<br /><br />The glass front window suction cup mount for the monitor is very firmly adhered.  The camera/monitor picture resolution is more than sufficient for our needs.  The monitor size is good because the Pioneer windshield is much closer to the driver than in any car.  We just ordered a second exact same system for the passenger side of the Pioneer 1000.  Also, we plan to install one in our truck and probably another in our diesel tractor(s).  Night vision is also a plus.<br /><br />We shall install both UTV monitors adjacent at the upper left windshield corner, left for left side viewing, right for right.  A 1/4” hole behind each camera will allow their wiring to enter the cab.  Zip ties shall affix all wiring to the UTV ROPS frame to deliver video signal to the monitors.

919155,5,Premium Engineered Z690 (12th gen + 13th gen) Motherboard,"[[VIDEOID:e5dacb1743eeadb6028be0d6a14ff99f]] EVGA has incredibly designed a capable EATX board with a premium focus. The EVGA Z690 Classified has a triple BIOS design instead of normal dual BIOS in case something goes wrong for an added safety net. They had provided a tiny USB with the required driver as a .exe file with their manual. I would like to note in the manual there is a typo for the power on flashback instructions (for those who only have a 13th gen CPU)-corrected version would be holding down the bios flash button for 2 seconds to initiate the flashback if you do not hold the CMOS reset button. They have provided two pump headers for AIOs and several system fan headers for even the most spacious cases. I tested this system and it worked upon first boot with XMP on with 6000 MHz DDR5 RAM. Overall, you can expect the BIOS flashback to take around 8-10 minutes. You need to follow the manual and use a USB 2.0 flash drive that is in FAT 32 that contains only the extracted bios file downloaded from the EVGA website. Afterward, plug in the USB to the dedicated BIOS flashback port on the motherboard. Make sure only the CPU power and main ATX power are connected to the board, then flip the PSU on (not the front panel connectors). Hold the BIOS button on the rear for 2 seconds and start the flashing process. You would see the debug led going into a clockwise position and flashing. It will stop when the process has ended, and you may get a debug code like 00 or other depending on the setup. One thing to note is to control the ARGB or RGB headers on the board you will have to use the EVGA ELEET X1 to customize your PCs LEDs will have to disable Windows Memory Integrity (can turn it back on later and changes will be saved into the system). Moreover, you must bypass Windows default online setup to a local account during OS install (Shift + F10 | In Command Prompt, type the OOBE\BYPASSNRO | restart) then load your drivers provided from the USB .exe file (no need to download the Intel Rapid Storage driver). Please note that the system will not recognize ethernet LAN or Wi-Fi without installing drivers which is the last step. The EVGA team made the entire process straightforward with all the documentation for even the newest PC builders.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qVW9o3t2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qVW9o3t2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qVW9o3t2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81aKDoUpQfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81aKDoUpQfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81aKDoUpQfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81algx21I6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81algx21I6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81algx21I6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81j0YXYQKrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81j0YXYQKrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81j0YXYQKrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09ZD4HMRR,B0BN5HPNCP,AH4EZI6G5BSYF4437YX2DQNKFQ3Q,2023-01-19 09:00:34.878,2,True,506

As stated above and clearly, they are for 2.4G wifi only.<br /><br />Start with the phone app using the process in the manual exactly with the iCSee app.  For many people this may be enough if you are only using these cameras in your setup and that's the only way you will ever view them. You can stop right here.  To do anything more advanced, you need the ""VMS"" application on a MAC/PC.<br /><br />You need to determine the IP address from your router as it is not visible anywhere in the ICSee phone app.  The VMS application did not automatically discover my camera, so I had to manually add it using the IP address and kind-of guessing at the fields to add.  Surprisingly I was able to connect.  That was the make/break moment for these cheap cameras.  If I hadn't been able to connect, they would have been returned.<br /><br />Once connected via the VMS application you can change a ton of parameters and configure these things fully.  I was actually surprised at how many knobs they expose.  After some experimentation, I was able to determine that the stream addresses are:<br /><br />rtsp://(your IP address):554/user=admin&password=(xxx)&channel=1<br />rtsp://(your IP address):554/user=admin&password=(xxx)&channel=1&stream=1<br /><br />The first is the high-def stream and the second is the low-def stream.  Obviously use your IP address and whatever password you set up in the ICSee app (no parentheses).  Don't use punctuation or funny characters in the password you chose for these cameras as it will affect the string interpretation.<br /><br />Now don't expect cinema-quality video and they do seem to lose I-frames more frequently than I would like,  but for $13 each and such a simple screw-in-a-lightbulb-socket installation, they are an easy/cheap way to add more eyes to a home security setup.",[],B0BJPL3HDK,B0BJPL3HDK,AHUD2MJN56SDTM7DXCHHNUCKRITA,2023-03-13 16:04:04.053,3,True,506

212066,4,Lots of work to get answers from customer service.,"The good: connects very well. The controls on the app are excellent. The software is very good and comes with an instruction manual. The manual is very specific For the most part. It is missing some elements. Picture quality is excellent Both day and night. It’s human  detection is excellent as well as tracking.<br /><br />The bad: You need two extenders because the camera will not work properly if it is above the outdoor wall lamp. I had to buy a 6-inch socket extender and it still didn't fully go beyond the lamp. I had to purchase another 2-inch extender so it would work beyond the bottom of the lamp holder.  Could not get it to scan properly because the camera would screw in so that it did not give a full 180 degrees, even after I adjusted the camera using the app.  CUSTOMER SERVICE IS mediocre. . It takes them a long time to get back (they are in China) and customer service reps take weekends off starting on Friday mornings instead of the end of the day. Then, when they return, they tell you to read the manual. I told them the SD card sticks out of the unit. I followed their instructions to the tee, but as you can see from the pic, the SD card sticks out enough for someone to steal it easily. They then insulted my intelligence by asking me to read the manual. Well, duh! I'm a tech guy and know that!<br /><br />Update 2/6/2023--I received an email from the rep. They asked some questions and decided it was defective. They are sending me two (I think) more since I bought two. I'll update this when I test the ones coming to me.<br /><br />Update. 2/6/2023<br /><br />After a number of times asking the same questions, they finally admitted that the SD card does stick out a bit. ( see photo). So they need not send replacements. It works fine.  New problem: I have to repeat my question which was how to get the camera to go back to its original position? They never answered the question, ( since I’m sure they have trouble with our language) so I sent the message again.  I do like the camera but it is very difficult to get immediate answers from them. They do answer after 24 hours. Otherwise, it would have received 5 stars.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51aQctJma-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51aQctJma-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51aQctJma-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZdbsFicML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZdbsFicML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZdbsFicML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KPfL+B8yL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KPfL+B8yL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KPfL+B8yL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BN87XP73,B0BN87XP73,AHRFELX3INKLCUURFRAYFLEATJLQ,2023-02-03 19:25:52.630,1,True,506
935228,4,Portable. Basic but functional remote + cables. Outside or small business use. Needs a carry case.,"Use for watching TV, movies, YouTube, etc. in a room where you don’t have a TV. Also an option for outside use/viewing during warmer months. People in our house also like to do crafts, and this can be used to project images onto large surfaces like a wall or canvas.<br /><br />I did my initial testing at 110 inches away from the screen. The screen I used is an old white comforter hung on the wall (this will replicate how I’ll use it in the back yard). I connected using HDMI.<br />I’ll definitely want a higher table or tri-pod, but that’s not a big issue. It is bright enough for comfortable viewing, but not as bright as a TV or computer screen. If you are not doing a side by side comparison, it’s not an issue, but if you look at the projected image vs a computer or TV screen, there is an obvious difference. A brighter white surface to project on could help as well. For the record, I did try with different settings for brightness, etc.<br /><br />It’s definitely easy to operate and it’s a portable size. Remote is basic but good, in fact I preferred it over the on-device buttons. I have a 6mm tripod that fits several camera bases I have, but it does not fit the projector... the projector screw/insert is smaller than the standard camera size - just be sure to measure this before buying a tri-pod or ceiling mount.<br /><br />This isn’t going to replace one of my screens, but it will be nice to use for outside viewing during warmer months, craft projects, etc. I also have a small business, and it could come in handy if I ever need to present and the facility doesn’t have a projector.<br /><br />Comes with some cables and a functional remote. It would have been nice if it came with some sort of storage/carry case – not a show stopper, but would have been nice. Time will tell how well it holds up.<br /><br />Given the price point, and what you get, I’m rating it 4 stars. I think it could have been a little brighter, WiFi for video streaming would be a welcomed addition, power cord is a little short, but overall, a solid option for an entry level projector.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51T8eqVoqSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51T8eqVoqSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51T8eqVoqSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EKiPauGHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EKiPauGHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EKiPauGHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61eakcvQNcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61eakcvQNcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61eakcvQNcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71F9RmoABgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71F9RmoABgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71F9RmoABgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BQR68PJ1,B0C7G2WSV9,AFIEQFLQW5SAF2XE2VIJRWT46WVA,2023-02-24 19:57:40.026,0,False,506
229767,4,Very useful device at a great price but NO optical zoom. Works well w/iPhone but lacking w/iMac.,"This small, lightweight microscope is quite a useful device and was very easy to set up and use with my iPhone.  I simply downloaded the app and followed the easy instructions (only a few steps).  It uses WiFi to connect to your phone and the image is remarkably sharp and clear for such an inexpensive device.<br /><br />One thing it can NOT do is zoom, as the description would have you believe.  It has no optical zoom capabilities whatsoever.  The control ring around the unit is simply used to focus the microscope depending upon how far you are away from your subject. You can focus on a 12"" wide object from several feet away or move in super close with the clear plastic housing resting on your object where you will only be viewing about a ¼"" wide object. That is what they mean by zooming; simply focusing at different distances.<br /><br />The app they built for the iPhone does allow you to digitally zoom the image up to 4X but that is just enlarging the pixels; no additional detail is being captured.<br /><br />Despite it not optically zooming, it does quite a good job of showing you the fine details of very small objects which your eye couldn't resolve without help.<br /><br />One thing that does NOT work very well is the option to plug the microscope into your Mac desktop computer and use the Mac's built-in Photo Booth app, as the microscope's instructions recommend.  The Mac will recognize the camera without any problem but you will need to select it under the ""Camera"" drop down menu which the instructions don't explain.<br /><br />Once the camera is selected you will see the image on your desk top but the image is unfortunately laterally reversed (flipped left to right like you see yourself in a mirror) which is annoying at best.  Photo Booth does give you the option to ""automatically flip new items"" but you will only be able to view the flipped-view AFTER you shoot a video or take a still photo.  While you're shooting, everything is still reversed.<br /><br />The other thing to note is that the microscope sets an initial color balance when it first sees its subject and then keeps that color balance until you turn off the camera. That means if you decide to add some supplemental lighting that isn't the same color as your initial lighting, the image will be way off color until you turn the camera off and back on again.",[],B0BQ2B6QBW,B0CGCW1YP9,AHC5VRYWOIUH5VPCUA5CJREX5DKA,2023-01-31 05:34:29.585,0,False,506
157930,4,Sacrificial Screen for Scratches and Moderate Drop,"I have Spigen protector glass on 2 iPhones.  I recommend the product (about $16 for 1 + Tax). My expectation is the Protector is a sacrificial layer for scratches and drops from desk chair, bed heights, on INDOOR floors like carpet squares, loom carpet and hardwood. IF used with a case. IF you drop your iPad  on OUTDOOR surfaces like cement sidewalk, or indoor marble, stone, garage floor, etc., I think your iPad  will be toast.<br /><br />Second point is installation. Buyers have a variety of experiences. My was VG-to-Excellent: the package was in a nice retail box (for store display), there is 1 large install plastic tray where your iPad is inserted into the tray.  Cleaner wipes are provided to clean fingerprints, organic matter, etc. (otherwise, debris is trapped when the protector screen is applied), plus a dust wipe.  After cleaning, use the dust wipe to remove dust that will fall from air.  Remove the protector glass from the plastic sleeve; then peel out the clear film from the contact side of the protector.  Then lay the protector on your iPad; the glass can inserted only 1 way.  As instructed, swipe & press down in the middle; from the middle, I then worked my way left, then right.  This is to attach the protector to the iPad screen.<br /><br />I removed my iPad from tray, and removed the 2nd film from the glass, and there were several large bubbles between the protector glass and iPad screen.  I used the provided plastic blade to push out the air bubbles; what worked for me was to press down the blade, then push (always applying  pressure so air doesn't into the area behind the blade ) the bubble towards the closest edge.  This technique allowed to to get rid of all the bubbles.<br /><br />The screen protector only covers the visible display, and not edge-to-edge of the iPad. The glass becomes a bevel surface around the visible part of the screen face, like crown molding.<br /><br />In use, I didn't feel the screen to be ""thicker"" or less responsive than a bare screen. Again, my expectations are to absorb scratches, and with my iPad body case, survive a drop on indoor surfaces.<br /><br />I recommend this, as this is my 3 Spigen for an average price.",[],B08YK3D63M,B08YK3D63M,AGJTR5A6UFVWQKUM7NBQRKAY6XVA,2023-03-30 04:20:12.540,0,True,506
1816,5,"Should be really great for regular sized monitors, tuning necessary for 21"" and larger monitors.","A real plus with the Nulea wired trackball is the ease of installation and unlike a mouse, that you don't need to move the entire trackball to move the cursor.  Just use your thumb to move the red ball.  This is handy if you have limited real estate on your computer to physically move the device.  This could be a great advantage when you in situations where you would like mouse type control but no space to move the mouse like on an airplane or in bed without a hard surface.<br /><br />The first photo shows an illustration of the buttons that you'll find on the trackball.  It is very easy to connect and install.  Just plug the cord into the USB and it should be ready to go. I'm using Windows 11 so it was immediately recognized when plugged in.  I didn't have to configure anything, but I went to settings anyhow just to see.  Windows recognized the trackball as a USB input device as shown in the second photo.<br /><br />The Nulea handles nicely, and the track ball is responsive. Depending on the monitor you have, you may need to press the button under the wheel one or more times to find the DPI setting that works best for moving the trackball pointer on the screen. I'm using a large 21 monitor, so I need to pick my thumb off the red trackball to reposition and move it a second time to have the cursor get from one edge of the screen to the other.  If you are using a regular monitor this should not be much of a problem. For me it is only a concern when playing a game that takes up the 21"" full screen.  That is when I switch to the traditional mouse.  Note that in the last photo that I keep both the trackball and the mouse hooked up to the computer at the same time. I can simply stop using one and switch to the other.  I like using the trackball when I'm on the internet doing searches, shopping, and doing input type work like writing this review.  For full screen games I'll stick to the mouse.<br /><br />From prior experience I learned that a trackball may need to come out of the hole for cleaning when the cursor starts to skip and act semi responsive. There is a hole on the bottom of the device where you can press up and force the red trackball out. Then you can easily clean it and put it back.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LyoC9HMVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LyoC9HMVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LyoC9HMVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rhrrxo0aL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rhrrxo0aL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rhrrxo0aL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sev+6JpGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sev+6JpGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sev+6JpGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71d3Cms5ERL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71d3Cms5ERL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71d3Cms5ERL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pnjHlZjEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pnjHlZjEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pnjHlZjEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BML9JYBR,B0C772WXKG,AG5TSDN4PO6GCGZYH43P4JJNQ2JA,2023-01-09 19:38:12.416,1,False,506

E.g. once you take out one earbud for a short while or dislodge, you need to remove both, then put it back into the box to reconnect. If you just wear one back to your ear without putting both in the box, your bluetooth connection is lost.<br /><br />- It amplifies other static  (buzzing ) noises around the house during the call .

But Once I'm my meeting call, all the buzzing noises  (low frequency noises) from fridge, microwave and all other electromagnetic appliances noise become so loud in the earbuds. It is even in my ""Quiet"" setting. I tested with different apps (zoom, FB messengers, normal call, Teams) all are having the same issue only with this earbuds.<br /><br />- It doesn't have noise cancellation for its microphone. So, other party in your call will hear all the slightest background noise while you think it's completely quiet with your earbuds. Many often people in my meeting complains about background noises with this headset more than any other headsets.<br /><br />---<br />I have $40 no-name headset from amazon that I bought .

887296,5,Finally I can work,"I don't own a Surface. I bought this for my work laptop because the keyboard was starting to fail. The keys stopped registering unless I pressed hard which made it frustrating to enter things like passwords. I had to plug in a USB keyboard just to be able to get any work done. This Bluetooth keyboard saved my job. I'm able to work all over the house now, not just at my desk, and I've gotten so much done. The keyboard sits on top of my 13 inch laptop perfectly. And all the keys are pretty much in the same places. Its so light, I don't mind traveling with this extra keyboard in my bag.<br /><br />The keys feel amazing to type on. Short throw like most thin boards but has good resistance and pressure. Quiet too. The backlighting is not too bright but there is quite a bit of leakage around each of the keys. I leave it on the lowest brightness setting. The touchpad is wider than what I'm used to but it feels okay. Sometimes it doesn't register my taps but that might be my finger.<br /><br />The switch on the side is difficult to operate and only moves a millimeter. This helps prevent accidentally turning it off but a little more play would have been welcome. Thankfully it pairs fast with my Windows 10 laptop. You just have to add it manually within the Bluetooth settings. It comes with a meter long USB-C to A cable to charge.<br /><br />The layout is also different here as it has dedicated PgUp and PgDn keys and the inverted-T arrow keys. The Function keys (F1-F12) require you to hold down the Fn modifier key to press them so that top row of keys defaults to the special functions like brightness, volume, and media keys. The keyboard material is smooth plastic on top, easy to clean, and the bottom of the keyboard is completely covered in this soft felt type material that feels nice and cozy.<br /><br />This is one of the more pricey 3rd party options for Surface type covers so you could probably save some money by going cheaper but you're already saving so much just by going with 3rd party, and you get wireless support which Microsoft's doesn't have.

787649,5,Super comfortable without sacrificing sound quality,"These are extremely comfortable ear buds that do not go into the ear canal. They sit outside and partially cover the opening allowing sound to travel through but it doesn't block other outside sources completely.  So for instance, your jamming while washing your car and your wife is trying to tell you something from the doorway, you'll be able to hear that she is talking to you, unlike when I wear my noise canceling headphones and she has to tap me on the shoulder scaring me to death.<br /><br />If noise canceling is what you are going for, these are not for you. These are for comfort without sacrificing sound quality. The sound quality is what really has me liking these. I have two other pairs of wireless in-ear buds and not only do they hurt after a bit, but the sound doesnt compare to these, now keep in mind they range in the $50 range. For those of you who pair your wireless headphone to a watch, like a galaxy 4, you may have experienced a drop in sound quality when using some lower end products. These continue to sound pretty good, not as high in quality as going through my phone, but there is still some base and you don't get that flat high all treble cheapness.<br /><br />I've worn them for about 4 hours non-stop and I can barley feel them. The clip that hooks around my ear are comfortable and not tight or ""pinchy"". After 4 hours the battery is sitting at 80%.<br /><br />The case is nice and sturdy, doesn't feel cheap, nor should it for $130. The ear buds were 100% charged when I paired them up. I charged the case up while I was playing on my computer. The case is a bit bulky but nothing that I'd really feel would make me not purchase these.<br /><br />The controls I'm still getting use to but to turn sound down you double tap left ear button, to turn sound up you double tap right button. Pause by pushing either ear once. Move tracks forward by long pressing the right, move backwards by long pressing left ear. I don't really like the controls but it's not a deal breaker.<br /><br />Overall these are my new favorite music listening Device. They are light, connected easily, allow me to not lose track of what's going on around me, and most important to me, the sound quality is above reasonable for $130.",[],B0BKPHM7XR,B0C5MBXV2Q,AHWW4NBQVUPQFFAIOI3UCOHEIASA,2023-03-27 03:55:23.127,0,False,506
78683,3,"Wonky setup, good results, decent features","This FeiyuTech Scorp Mini is a decent looking lightweight gimbal that brings a great amount of features in a run-and-gun style package. The packaging that it shipped in is great, and holds everything in a nicely presented package.<br /><br />Setup:<br />The physical setup is alright. I have two other gimbals, one from Zhiyun, and one from DJI. The Feiyutech here is worse in pretty much every way when it comes to actually attaching the camera to the gimbal. Having a two piece attachment is good in theory, but the adjustment mechanism for balancing and the way it attaches is just wonky. Definitely some improvement to be had there.<br /><br />The balancing of most gimbals is a huge pain, and this one was no different. Worse, in fact, because of the way that the axis locks work. Using a rotating mechanism to lock the balance is not great, and makes it annoying to do minute adjustments. Having axis LOCKS, as in, they wont move when not in use, is great. My DJI has that, albeit automatic, and seeing them here, although manual, is a great feature.<br /><br />After finally getting the gimbal balanced, with a Sony A7III and 50mm prime lens, it worked great as a lightweight gimbal. The interface on the gimbal was glitchy, and the instruction manual was absolutely vital to actually figure out what the buttons did. I figured I'd check out the app, which is also poorly constructed. The firmware updating process was glitchy but seemed to work.<br /><br />After updating the firmware, I didn't really have any desire to use the app again. Fortunately, you can do most of what you need on the gimbal itself - except, sometimes the touchscreen doesn't really do anything you think it should do. In addition, I couldn't get the auto-calibration to work at all.<br /><br />Overall, this gimbal is a bit wonky, but seems like it will do the job it was designed to do well. I really expected a lot more polish for something so pricey, but it is what it is. Feels overkill for a gopro, and a little underpowered for SLR-style cameras. The low weight limit really wants you to only use a small camera with prime lenses.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510XCLgMzzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510XCLgMzzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510XCLgMzzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612GlKPwpmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612GlKPwpmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612GlKPwpmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OF5XwwfpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OF5XwwfpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OF5XwwfpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61l3VVZIDBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61l3VVZIDBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61l3VVZIDBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qoPKLUjaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qoPKLUjaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qoPKLUjaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71s5TK-qWtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71s5TK-qWtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71s5TK-qWtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BGLSC7KS,B0BFHD51DM,AHVPYCRHWOIVME43YYPSBSTZ5DDQ,2023-01-15 02:41:33.175,0,False,506
830157,3,"It works, but doesn't protect the hard drive well at all","This is a review of ""iDsonix 3.5 Inch Hard Drive Enclosure SATA USB C 3.1 Ultra 6G Speed External HDD Caddy Tool-Free Design for UASP , SATA HDD/SSD""<br /><br />I debated whether one star was the right rating for this hard drive case, but decided on three stars because it does function as advertised, even if it is a poor choice of an external case, in my opinion. I have helped design data storage systems professionally and really the only application I might consider this case for would be to temporarily hook up bare drives that were being stored to archive data. This isn't a case of having too high expectations; I've seen plenty of ""consumer grade"" cases that are way better than this one.<br /><br />1) First off, the instructions show the top sliding nicely off to make room for the drive. It took me quite a few minutes to realize that you need to pinch the plastic sides to pop the top off, the mechanism doesn't work at all like the instructions imply. Frustrating, but not the end of the world.<br /><br />2) Once the lid is off it becomes apparent that there is no cushioning at all. You slide the bare drive into the slot and that's that. Since the drive isn't screwed in and there's not even any foam to hold the drive in place once it's installed and the case is closed, the drive is left to rattle around if you jiggle the case. If this is for a drive you are going to use very infrequently and the case is going to be left on a desk surface all the time, maybe it's sufficient. I would never transport a drive in a case like this. This is pretty much of a deal killer for me, even though I don't intend to be carrying the drive around much. My data is far too valuable to trust to a case like this.<br /><br />3) On the plus side, the Seagate Enterprise 8 TB hard drive fit and powered right up, formatted well and I got the expected performance in my drive performance test application. So functionally it appears to work well.<br /><br />Overall, it was worth trying, but this case really doesn't meet my expectations, even looking at this as a consumer. I will not be using this and will look for a better constructed option, probably one with a fan and temperature monitor.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613g-KVhWqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613g-KVhWqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613g-KVhWqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712nAuUwcAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712nAuUwcAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712nAuUwcAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71usk4qmiSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71usk4qmiSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71usk4qmiSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B19DR214,B0B19DR214,AHNTC7YWIIR22VPTTYYNTZOAIXCQ,2023-02-11 05:35:18.076,0,False,506
704996,5,Know What You're Buying!!!,"I'll start with the cons before the pros because there's little downside to this product.<br /><br />What I didn't like is the misinformation on the title of this product and not being clear on the type of cable. This is NOT a display port cable/connection and this is a UNIDIRECTIONAL (one-way) cable. To be more accurate, this cable is MICRO-HDMI (Source) to HDMI (Output) with an adapter to turn it into an HDMI to HDMI cable.<br /><br />With that out of the way, this cable is amazing. You need to know what you're buying first of.<br /><br />Expensive: This is a Fiber Optic Cable. Its expensive because its fiber optic, meaning this is thinner than the regular long HDMI cables and also means you don't compromise with the signal just because its thinner. You get faster and better quality compared to the typical HDMI cables. Compare it to your internet provider, we always hear that Fiber Internet is faster and better signal compared to regular internet provider. Hence you pay more for Fiber Internet, its the same with this cable, you're paying for the quality.<br /><br />Durability: Normally, Fiber Optic Cables are very fragile, they break easily when bending. But because of the heavy duty nylon braided, normal bending and use doesn't break this cable easily. You can easily use this on a live production and not worry about signal breaking just cause someone stepped on the cable or twisted the cable wrong. But don't get the wrong idea that this can be twisted and knotted without damage (I haven't tested that, but I wouldn't try it).<br /><br />Use: You can tell this product is meant for professional photography/videography/broadcasting because those devices (cameras and camcorders) still use Micro-HDMI. But because of the adapter, you can use this cable for pretty much any type of device (computer, video games, appleTV, Firestick, etc).<br /><br />Testing: I've connected this cable to my GoPro which handles 4K at 60Hz. And this works flawlessly at an amazing quality. Very fluent and clear image/video, no drop frames. I've also used this cable to connect my PC (4K) to my monitor and I get the same type of quality. Haven't had any issues and would definitely recommend",[],B0BP69YXH9,B0BZ3NJNJN,AFNMXGNFGDBINTIYZIOR576OSWSQ,2023-04-14 14:42:07.577,0,False,506
764752,3,"Nice Turntable Stand, IF It Isn't Delivered Damaged","My wife ordered this turntable stand under her Amazon account, so I won't show as a ""Verified Purchaser."" However, we did indeed purchase this product.<br /><br />This is a nice looking turntable stand, albeit a bit overpriced for laminated particle board. The old- school retro look, and distressed ""wood"" laminate, make this turntable stand look unique. The included dual outlet and dual USB power strip is also very convenient. The dual drawers will hold a lot of useful music related items. The metal record dividers and legs are also a nice touch. The assembly of this turntable stand is easy and straight forward, and it took about 45 minutes to build (after I repaired the shipping damage).<br /><br />That is where the good ends. The turntable stand we received arrived in a box that looked like it was drug down the street behind a dump truck. This caused one of the drawer fronts to crack and become gouged. I ended up having to temporarily fix the gouged front of the drawer with wood filler and furniture repair markers in order to match the distressed finish. I also repaired the crack by using wood glue, and small metal straps and screws inside the drawer front. The pre-installed drawer glides for the right drawer were also installed about 1/4"" too high, making it so that the drawer would not close. I had to removed the drawer glides and reinstall them 1/4"" lower. Also, the holes for the metal record dividers are drilled all the way through the particle board to the laminate. If pushed to hard when being installed, the divider legs will poke right through the bottom of the turntable stand.<br /><br />My wife contacted the seller under her Amazon account, and sent them pictures of the damaged drawer front. The seller stated that they will send us a new drawer front, but it could take several weeks (or more) as it has to ship from China. Say what? It's a good thing that the ""temporary"" repairs I made work, and look good, for now. Otherwise, I would not have even been able to build the turntable stand for many weeks.<br /><br />I recommend this turntable stand IF it arrives without any damage, as it does look nice. However, trying to get replacements for broken parts can be a hassle.

495189,3,"Works well with phones, but not good for TVs","This was a tough product for me to review.  Overall, it works well, but it doesn't work well for the purpose for which I got them:  watching TV.  The headphones do not have the aptX codec which allows for several audio enhancements, most notably (for me) low-latency reception.  This means that when using the headphone while watching on a TV, the audio and video will be out of sync.  The time difference is not huge (maybe a second or two), but enough that its very noticeable when characters are talking.  It's like watching a non-english language movie where an english voice is dubbed in.<br /><br />This delay is not noticeable when watching a video on my phone, however.  Maybe because the distance between the phone and the headphones is much shorter.  When watching on the phone, or listening to music, the sound is pretty good.  I find the bass to be muddled, but the midrange and highs sound good to me.<br /><br />The headphones appear to be well-made.  I like the stainless steel look of the backs of the earcups.  I'm less a fan of the color of the foam and headband, but that's just personal preference.  The headphones fold up nicely and come with a carrying case.  The ear cups are soft and comfortable.  When I first saw the headphones, I was afraid the ear cups would be too small.  But they weren't; the cups surrounded my ears, without touching them (it might not work out so well for someone with a much larger head [I'm 5'10""]).  I thought he head band might be a little big as it didn't contact the top of my head, but then I noticed that the ear cups are angled such that the headband actually sits towards the front of the head, rather than on the crown.<br /><br />In summary, these phones have decent sound (not audiophile quality, but I'd be shocked if they did at the price), are comfortable, and work well with phones.  The price ($56 at the time of this review) is higher than similar headphones available on Amazon, but the quality of the cheaper headphones may not be as good.<br /> When watching on a TV, however, the sound is out-of-sync with the video.  I'm hoping the company can add the aptX codecs via a firmware upgrade.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81FxquyfdhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81FxquyfdhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81FxquyfdhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BWF8GMB2,B0BZNPRKXG,AGK5R5UCUGYW4XSHO36KOXC26SWA,2023-03-28 15:18:06.953,0,False,506
564445,5,Excellent mATX board for Ryzen 9 7000 series,"This is a very high quality board with generous heat sinks and no tiny fans to get clogged.<br />Stuff I liked:<br />Metal reinforced PCIe x16 slot.<br />A robust retaining clip on the x16 slot that won't break off if you need to remove the video card.<br />Both a gen 4 and a gen 5 nvme drive slot. Both have heat sinks.<br />Indicator lights on the motherboard help with basic diagnostics. They actually came in handy for me.<br />UEFI BIOS is easy to set up. Smart memory access is called Resizable BAR here, but is trivial to enable in any event. AMD EXPO memory profiles are likewise trivial to set up.<br />Built-in backplane for all external ports made of a real alloy plate.<br />Built-in Bluetooth is a nice touch.<br />Armoury Crate installs automatically when you install a bog standard version of Windows 11.<br /><br />What I didn't like so much:<br />Armoury Crate wants to install chipset and video drivers rather than let Windows install the chipset drivers. I prefer to install video drivers directly from AMD.<br />PCIe 5.0 is only available for 1 nvme slot. It is not available to the x16 card slot.<br />No optical or coax out for on-board HD audio.<br />Manual could stand to use a better, more legible font.<br />The number of SATA connectors is dwindling compared to previous generations.<br />The DRAM indicator comes on and stays amber for a disturbingly long period of time during boot. The boot eventually proceeds just fine, but this behavior can make diagnosing RAM issues a pain.<br /><br />Warning! Installing DDR5 memory is tricky. The manual tells you to use what appear to be secondary slots for installing 2 sticks, and this does seem correct BTW (one per channel, use the gray DIMM slots). But since DDR5 is notched just about dead center, it may not be obvious which way to insert a module.<br />General rule of thumb is, the branding on the RAM should face away from the CPU. Since I bought G.Skill memory, both sides of the heat sink had branding. D'oh! The trick is to look at the branding on the top edge of the heat sink (see photos). Also, the holographic stickers were facing toward the CPU.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YKjXV2xaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YKjXV2xaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YKjXV2xaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61y4+MStRjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61y4+MStRjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61y4+MStRjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BHMW2L8B,B0BZ4VX7TN,AHWHFM7GM3VFWHI6UXT4B6PMVWCA,2023-02-10 16:10:48.487,4,True,506
33336,5,"Well Made, Powerful, Easy to Setup & Use, Nice Value","This is a great and powerful mini PC! First off, the unit itself feels nicely made and doesn't feel cheap. I really like the design and the size is perfect. It has multiple USB ports and has support for dual HDMI displays.<br /><br />The PC came with a fully licensed copy of the Windows 11 Pro operating system and had no issues doing the updates and getting it setup with my Microsoft account. I was also able to hook up a wireless mouse and keyboard and had no issues with operation. Other peripherals such as webcams, printers, and others worked just fine, too..<br /><br />The setup of this PC was extremely easy - plug it in, turn it on, follow the on screen prompts for setting up Windows and your account, and you're all set. Depending on the monitor or TV you are using for this mini PC, there may be some over burn along the edges. If this happens, just simply adjust the settings on your monitor or TV.<br /><br />Once this was setup, I tested playing 4K sample videos and it played them with no issues - no stuttering or jitters during play back. I also played games on multiple cloud gaming services (Luna, Stadia, xCloud, Shadow, and GeForce Now) and this had no issues playing. I tried other other games that you would have to install and most of them ran fine. If you are looking to play more graphics intense games, then I wouldn't recommend this. However, if you just want to play casual games or don't mind playing in lesser quality, then you will have no issues with this one. I can also say I used this to render a 4K video through Power Director and it handled it with no problems to report.<br /><br />The dual monitor output works as it should and allowed for a great overall experience. When using this setup, I was able to multi-task without the PC slowing down much. In fact, I would say it was hardly noticeable.<br /><br />All things considered, this a great mini PC that works as described and in my opinion, is an excellent value for the price. It's portable, pretty powerful (for most things), and easy to use. It's not going to be a gaming power house so just be aware. If you want to do light gaming, light video editing, and anything else below that power wise, then this is perfect!

618742,4,Work Well!,"Ankbit E500Pro+ Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones. Out of the box they feel solid. They come with a very nice case for storing the headphones. They look modern and feel comfortable. Charging was simple using the included USB-C cable. They also included a standard audio plug cable that I won’t be using as none of my current devices support this. I could see the cable being helpful for older devices with plugs and no Bluetooth support. The included instruction manual is all pictures but pretty easy to figure out. Pairing this to my iPhone and iPad was simple. The button layout and their functions are straight forward. The only thing lacking is that there is no way to gauge power remaining while using. There is a charging indicator light for when you have it plugged in and the light goes off when fully charged. I have an older Bose headset that tells you by voice how much power is remaining each time I turn them on. I find this very helpful as it allows me to gauge if I can use it with what power is left or if I need to charge it. I will say that the Bose were almost 3 times the cost of these so maybe the trade off is worth it. In almost all other areas they compare very favorably with the Bose. Sound quality is clear and excellent. Noise cancellation seems almost the same as the Bose which is very good. They support Siri for voice control. The Bose offers an App that works with the headset, there is no App support with these, but I hardly ever use the Bose App. Noise cancellation is always on with the Bose as long as the power switch is turned on. With these you need to press the ANC button each time after turning these on for noise cancellation. Some people may see this as an advantage as the noise cancellation does use more power and you cannot turn noise cancellation off with the Bose and still listen through the headset like you can with these. These also have a transparency mode that allows you to hear voices with the noise cancellation on. There is some white noise when you use this feature but the Bose does not even have this option (at least not on my model). I have been using these on and off for 2 days and they are still going strong on only one charge. Overall, I like these headphones which seem like a really good value. I would have given them 5 stars if they had a way to know the power status each time you turn them on.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61myJVDl43L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61myJVDl43L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61myJVDl43L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EvPtMW3wL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EvPtMW3wL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EvPtMW3wL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BN53S9L5,B0CC57LWTS,AF6KR2CPRUMS3TABMYUE75F26WOQ,2023-01-25 14:18:51.823,3,False,505

But it is more solidly attached and stays in place (and is more flexible on viewing angles) than anything else I have found.<br /><br />Original:<br />Only after it arrived and I opened the manual did I find out why this was not working just like my last screen.<br />This does not work with any other USB-C port except the absolute most recent version, USB-C 3.1 Gen 2!<br /><br />My previous extended screen (Duex Plus by Mobile Pixels) worked just fine with my USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 port. Unfortunately the construction on that unit is a bit flimsier and I broke an important part very shortly after starting to use.<br />This looked like (and still feels like) a more robust design.<br />BUT it requires the use of BOTH the USB-C port and the HDMI port to operate with my newer (less than a year) Windows 11 laptop (because as was FALSELY ADVERTISED, the HDMI port cannot generate power for the unit. It requires both ports to work.<br />SO sending it back. And pissed about the waste of time and resources that would have been skipped if the manufacturer/reseller would have just been honest in the advertising.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LFUVvu0OL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LFUVvu0OL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LFUVvu0OL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08W1ZNRSR,B08W1ZNRSR,AFGWKHMIQWNESIR4ZJVAD4J4GVKA,2023-03-15 00:54:56.164,0,True,505
726730,5,A great head unit for the money,"I bought this head unit for 2 main reasons: wireless Android auto, and 2 wire input for steering wheel controls. It has definitely fulfilled both of those reasons very well. There's plenty of reviews on the head unit in general so I'll touch on these specific points. That being said, the head unit overall is very nice, especially considering the price point.<br /><br />Firstly, the wireless Android auto. Wireless Android auto, although getting more popular, is still pretty hard to find on a not expensive head unit. I didn't want to have to plug my phone in every time I got in the car, and my phone for whatever reason has connection issues when plugged in. The wireless aa on this head unit is really nice. It takes about 20 seconds for it to enter Android auto from when the key is turned on, which is pretty good to me. The connection is really good, with a few occasional disconnects. That can be resolved quickly by just tapping the aa button again and you'll be back in about 10 seconds. I also don't have any of the issues I had with wired aa. Not sure what that's all about, but if you have a similar problem, this probably will work good for you.<br /><br />Secondly, the steering wheel controls. I have a 2009 Subaru outback 3.0r, and it has a 2 wire steering wheel control output. For this specific generation, you need to convert to the jdm climate control/radio bezel, and need a seperate harness to get the steering wheel control output wires. This radio has 2 wire input, so I was expecting the hookup to be similar to a past head unit I had, where I just matched 2 wires up and it worked. However in this, you have to ground one of the car-side swc wires, and hook the other up to one of the radio ones. The other radio one isnt hooked up to anything. This allowed it to work, and it's suprisingly responsive with the input too, which is a nice bonus from my last head unit.<br /><br />Overall I would highly recommend this head unit. The only thing I wish it had was the ability to turn the screen completely off while still listening to music. I do realize that thats a fairly uncommon feature, but I miss it from my last head unit. That being said, that's essentially my only complaint, so I'm still very happy with it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jE4DOv+2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jE4DOv+2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jE4DOv+2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pCUUJI-FL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pCUUJI-FL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pCUUJI-FL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08QGVFJ6K,B0BX9LJB3D,AES3XH7JVONK7AISTAYK6EYIIUEQ,2023-02-12 22:23:58.921,1,True,505
343735,4,Good for custom length install,"This mount is cheap and does what it is supposed to.  The armature has enough room to hide power, HDMI, and trigger wires with a little to spare.  The mount is white just like most ceilings (why black mounts and projectors on a white ceiling?  Silly.).<br /><br />This is ideal for my particular installation.  Nobody makes a mount designed to clear a standard ceiling-mount ceiling fan.  There are long down rods and tight surface-mount brackets , but no mid-length mounts.<br /><br />This mount is made of thin aluminum and is easy to hacksaw through to create a custom length.  Measure twice and thoroughly think through the geometry first.  To accomplish this you will need:<br />Tape measure<br />Hacksaw<br />Masking tape to protect the finish<br />Motor tool or file to finish cutout for wires<br />Sandpaper to clean up edges<br />Drill and bit to redrill holes in down rod<br /><br />There are countless odd custom installation needs that this could be the answer to.  Plus it’s cheap enough that if you muck it up there’s no need to cry.<br /><br />I do not like the way the projector bracket mounts to the down rod.  It’s awkward and damned near impossible.  Perhaps it would work better if the bracket/down rod assembly were connected first and then slid into the female section of the down rod.  You’d still have to fight the wires but at least there would only be one screw to contend with.<br /><br />The second big ding in the score is the lack of fine adjustment in the mount.  Using the mount to correct projector/screen alignment is preferable to using lots of keystone correction.  Most mounts have provisions for tilting the projector front/back and left/right through screws or thumbscrews.  This one relies on manhandling.  I even had to shim the top of the mount to get it to hold level.<br /><br />If I were still installing projectors for pay I’d definitely keep one or two of these on hand for odd installations.  It would not be difficult for the manufacturer to modify this design to intentionally be cut to size.  That sure would be handy and, I’d assume, probably sell well.",[],B01014WET4,B07BV5VMDS,AH2HMOWIKHIX2NHPPPE3BYI2J6MQ,2023-03-02 05:26:39.377,0,True,505
700525,4,"Quality parts, warm CPU, cool GPU","This is my first case from Fractal, and overall I am impressed by the quality and engineering of the case.<br /><br />The panels have thick durable paint. The magnetic front panel has fabric, but it's only for appearances, because air does not pass through it. The only piece of the case with questionable quality is the long plastic base/foot. It's super flexible and I could easily see it breaking if you move your computer around a lot.<br /><br />The build I put in here is probably beefier than Fractal intended the case for: The RTX 4080 FE easily fits, and stays between 50c and 60c during use, with no case fan installed. An RX 6950XT also fits easily alongside the two massive fans that Fractal included. The 4080 stays cooler in this case due to the location of it's air intake and exhaust.<br /><br />As nice as the fans are, I found that they were not useful in the case. Air does not move between the CPU and GPU chamber. You can not fit any fan within the CPU chamber, where they're needed most.<br /><br />Finding a CPU cooler that came in under 70mm that also fit the motherboard while keeping the chip cool was a challenge.<br /><br />I tried a few configurations with my 12600k and my Gigabyte Z690i Ultra Lite MB, but the only one I (forcefully) could fit was a low profile Noctua L12S. The required force was due to my board, not the case.<br /><br />I had to reshape the cooler to fit around the board's tall VRM heatsink and mount it sideways. It is keeping the CPU around 50c at idle, but spikes quickly with lots of fan noise under any load. The fan struggles to both cool and exhaust the heat.<br /><br />It's a beautiful and usable case from Fractal, but do consider the cooling limitations if you are thinking of purchasing. Additionally, consider where you'll place the case, if you sit to the right of it you're going to cook... Lol<br /><br />A+ packaging, assembly instructions, and design<br />C+ for case base/foot<br /><br />My biggest suggestion to Fractal is to add an inch or so to the width of this case. It wouldn't jeopardize the appearance, and would allow many more cooling options.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lTpjoPycL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lTpjoPycL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lTpjoPycL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81+9ZsPa0SL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81+9ZsPa0SL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81+9ZsPa0SL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09TRNBF3C,B0BMM8MZCS,AECYO5AVODCGZQM5THG33BOHAC4Q,2023-01-30 14:46:38.865,9,False,505

201644,5,Best thing for plex,Finally bought this to add to plex as well as an antenna. So glad I bought this. Hooked a coaxial cable from the antenna to this. And an ethernet cable from the hdhomerun to my router. Didn't need to download the hdhomerun software. Just went into plex and it showed up. Selected what ota(over the air) channels I wanted in my guide. Let it pull the programming guide up and it started recording. It was extremely easy. I'm using it through plex. So keep that in mind.<br />Now for some cons.<br />1. You can only dvr ota channels. Not plex channels themselves.<br />2. I noticed when viewing through the phone app the ota channels will stutter. Best thing to do is play 3 seconds then rewind it. That usually stops the stuttering.<br />3. Most issues I have experienced are with plex. Not the dvr itself.<br />4. The more channels you select the slower it loads on the guide. Don't know for sure if this is a plex issue or a dvr issues. But less works better.<br />5. A shorter coaxial cable from your antenna works better than with a long one. The longer the cable the less signal strength you get.<br />6. 2 tuners just doesn't seem to be enough. I should have bought the 4 tuner version.<br />7. If you don't close out what you are watching it will keep that tuner locked up as in use and fail to record.<br />8. If your plex server is not on and running ypu will not get ota channels. So make sure it is on during a power outtage or have a back up antenna hooked to a tv.<br /><br />Pros<br />1. Didn't need to download any software. Just worked straight out of thr box with plex.<br />2. Better signal strength and picture than with the antenna hooked up to the TV.<br />3. Dvr feature is nice. Buy a secondary Hard drive for your recordings.<br />4. Played very nicely with plex. But buy the 4 tuner model.<br />I would highly recommend this for anyone with plex that wants local channels. No extra software or downloads needed. No looking for guide software. Just plug and play. Will definitely be buying another one.,[],B092KM482V,B092KM482V,AF456IUSDBQYO5BJVS4DZDKCJZIA,2023-04-18 18:08:44.474,0,True,505
590340,4,Fits Sendy Aiva,"I ordered these to try with my SendyAudio Aivas, since I know DT990 pads are compatible size-wise (the pads measure roughly 100mm on my calipers). I trust the Dekoni name, but had yet to try anybody's cooling gel earpads.<br /><br />The Dekoni Gel Series fit the Aivas perfectly; before these pads, I was using aftermarket lambskin leather memory foam angled earpads. Compared to those, which have stitching at the edge of the ""lip"" that stretches around the mounting points, the Dekoni pads are easier to install.<br /><br />Dekoni states that these pads will yield tempered sub-bass along with increased mids and highs. For my use, I noticed a slight decrease in sub-bass, but no obvious effect on the mids and highs. Sound isolation is as good as can be expected with open-back headphones. Since Dekoki's sound comparisons apply to Beyerdynamics using factory pads, keep in mind that my assessment may not be indicative of your experience.<br /><br />I've avoided cooling gel pads for so long because (regardless of manufacturer), you can usually find reviews that say the cooling effect is marginal to ineffective; this is logical to me, since the ""cooling gel"" is typically a thin layer of material placed in front of whatever primary foam is being used. Unfortunately, these pads from Dekoni are no exception. They are indeed ""cool"" at first, but that sensation goes away quickly, and, in my experience sitting in a 70-degree room, they are indistinguishable from most traditional pads within 10 minutes of use. To be fair: you may notice a bigger difference if you move around a lot while gaming compared to my passive music listening; also, I do not find the pads to be hotter than others, either.<br /><br />Despite not being magical air conditioners for your ears, the pads do deliver the comfort you expect from Dekoni. The foam is soft and remains comfortable during extended use. The front of the pads are not leather or velour, but appear to be polyester (think of the activewear popular today); it is indeed cooler than velour, comfortable, and easier to keep clean.<br /><br />If you're in need of new pads, Dekoni is always a good choice, and you may be happy with these as long as you don't expect miracles in the cooling department.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51+dDmI74KL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51+dDmI74KL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51+dDmI74KL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81mLJ7XAWzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81mLJ7XAWzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81mLJ7XAWzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BT4J5D6Q,B0BT4J5D6Q,AGBDC6QTSUHLREWSZWKFWPSEHIRQ,2023-04-25 09:01:14.333,1,False,505
302223,4,"Get these instead of Sony Linkbuds, skip the app.","tldr: If you want open air, these are the best option, especially for the price. Don't fall for Sony's hole gimmick, it's terrible. The Soundpeats copy the 1st gen Apple Airpod design, and are a great open-air headphone. Just avoid their app. If you want to spend on Sony, get the Linkbuds S (the one with no hole).<br /><br />Full review: These aren't perfect, but they're much better than the price indicates. Compared to the $150 Sony Linkbuds:<br /><br />-Sound quality is no competition, Sony's hole ruins music. SoundPeats' sound is very nice, with plenty of Bass response, and a relatively flat sound curve. It's open air, so no subwoofer feeling, but still plenty of depth and dynamic range. Sony didn't use LDAC because the Linkbuds can't reproduce music accurately. The SoundPeats allow me to hear the difference between LDAC and AAC/SBC. It's not the highest quality out there, but it's very nice.<br /><br />-Comfort and security: Soundpeats is more comfortable and stays in the ear just as well as Sony. This is becuase Soundpeats copied the design of the first gen Apple Airpod. No fancy wings, they just stay in place. Sony's fat donut causes physical pain after an hour. SoundPeat's tapered design does not. It's still hard plastic, but the shape allows me to adjust the fitment to avoid any pain. Still not as comfortable as a silicone tip, but it's much closer than the Linkbuds.<br /><br />-Sony's app is awesome, so I can recommend the Linkbuds S (the one without the hole and uses typical silicone tips). Even if you need to hear your surroundings, the Linkbuds S has great transparency and ANC. I use the SoundPeats without ever installing the app.<br /><br />-SoundPeats' touch controls are more robust, but less reliable. Sony's Wide Area Tap should be standard with wireless earbuds, it's a shame they didn't include it with other models.<br /><br />-SoundPeats' case is more flat than Sony's, so it's easier to fit in a jeans coin pocket.

I really like the design and the size is perfect. It has multiple USB ports and has support for dual HDMI displays.<br /><br />The PC came with a fully licensed copy of the Windows 11 Pro operating system and had no issues doing the updates and getting it setup with my Microsoft account. I was also able to hook up a wireless mouse and keyboard and had no issues with operation. Other peripherals such as webcams, printers, and others worked just fine, too..<br /><br />The setup of this PC was extremely easy - plug it in, turn it on, follow the on screen prompts for setting up Windows and your account, and you're all set. Depending on the monitor or TV you are using for this mini PC, there may be some over burn along the edges. If this happens, just simply adjust the settings on your monitor or TV.<br /><br />Once this was setup, I tested playing 4K sample videos and it played them with no issues - no stuttering or jitters during play back. I also played games on multiple cloud gaming services (Luna, Stadia, xCloud, Shadow, and GeForce Now) and this had no issues playing. I tried other other games that you would have to install and most of them ran fine. If you are looking to play more graphics intense games, then I wouldn't recommend this. However, if you just want to play casual games or don't mind playing in lesser quality, then you will have no issues with this one. I can also say I used this to render a 4K video through Power Director and it handled it with no problems to report.<br /><br />The triple monitor output works as it should and allowed for a great overall experience. When using this setup, I was able to multi-task without the PC slowing down much. In fact, I would say it was hardly noticeable.<br /><br />All things considered, this a great mini PC that works as described and in my opinion, is an excellent value for the price. It's portable, pretty powerful (for most things), and easy to use. It's not going to be a gaming power house so just be aware.

968656,5,Amazing battery life,"OK, I may not be looking for the same things in a smart watch as most people, but this watch satisfies all that I was looking for.<br />It comes at a reasonable price.<br />It pairs with my Android phone without a lot of difficulty. Yes, you do need to install the app and set it up appropriately, and it's not completely obvious how to do that, but it isn't as confusing as some. I prefer that my watch shouldn't hijack the phone call function, and I did have to hold the watch to my ear for a few calls before I figured out that turning the phone off on the watch would keep it from answering calls without stopping text messages from displaying on the watch. You do have to set up the app to get messages on the watch, but that feature seems to work once set up.<br />The main point of a watch for me is to tell time, and the time it gets from my phone is, of course, what it gets from the network.<br />The really remarkable feature of this watch is its battery life, though. Its 400 mAh battery gives me a couple of weeks between recharges, and that's when I charge it, even though it's still showing about 35% battery power left. It should go for 3 weeks without much trouble, and there are steps like dimming the display that could give more time.<br />You can select from a large quantity of watch faces. That's OK, but you are limited to the choices in the app. The choices are like the channels on cable TV; lots of options but few you'd want to look at. You can insert your own background photo on one watch face, but that watch face shows only day of the week, date, and digital hours and minutes. I was hoping to be able to do more customization. I'd also like to see a digital time display with seconds.<br />The features are interesting and entertaining. I like the blood pressure feature because it gives me a much lower reading than a blood pressure cuff, but I am curious how it works at all. Things like heart rate and oxygen percentage seem to be accurate. Weather (outside temperature) depends on the phone to connect with an unidentified source on the internet and is updated hourly, which may not be enough.<br />This watch has more features than I'm interested in using, and the ones I've tried all seem to work.

In my pics the shot is over 100ft and it was clear and bright. If it looks out of focus it's because I didn't focus it with the wheel which BTW is smooth but long meaning turn turn turn to focus.<br /><br />The build quality is a couple notches above cheap. It's good with a solid ok feel but it's not high end or anything. Didn't expect it to be. Why is this only 1 star? Woooh let's get into it.<br /><br />The SD card slot broke the 1st time I pulled the card and reinserted it. 😐 Now I need some tweezers to pull it out. Still works though but the spring is caput. The display screen has wavy lines the whole time. The anti shake does nothing. There is no image stabilization. The microphone recording level is low only picking up your voice that is a few inches away. Good for narration if you speak loud enough but thats all. The mic is on the low end quality wise.<br /><br />The button press is way too clicky and it's apparent in playback videos. Theres also some kind of noise during playback sounding like a film reel rolling or something. Annoying. The display brightness cannot be adjusted it's glaringly bright at night but ok for daytime.<br /><br />Despite all of its flaws the night vision is really impressive with good adjustments. Too bad they didn't make all of it as good as the night vision. And I am extremely disappointed that I received a used one. 🤨<br /><br />Will update to see if you can buy with confidence from this seller.

104509,3,Stunned at rave reviews. This is a miserable brick,"[[VIDEOID:ca7cf7aaa7071275e3857b52855584c6]] I got this as a gift and was so excited.  I was a bit surprized at how big it is, and with the 2 'D' batteries it weighs 2 pounds.  I don't think I'll hang it on my shower head.<br /><br />I like the features -5 AM presets, 5 FM presets and the weather alert channels of which there seems to be 1 that come in.  It's easy to set up but that's where it ended.<br /><br />Hitting the ""band"" button to go from AM to FM would just activate the 60 second timer, which uses the same button.  For those 60 seconds there was no radio.  All I'd get is *any and every button""  I'd press bouncing between the weather channel and the clock until that 60 seconds ran out with no way to turn it off.  I thought it was defective until I had this happen a few times and realized that I guess there's some luck or secret to merely trying to change the band.<br /><br />The sound is horrific.  AM is ok but FM ...yikes.  The sound I'd scratchy, faint and fades in and out with worse interference if you move the radio any direction an inch.  I don't expect this out of what I was stunned to see was a really pricy radio.<br /><br />There's a long, wire FM antenna that hangs out the bottom but you wouldn't have this hanging out in the shower and it's very intrusive period.  I put it in the bathroom just to humor myself and the several places to hang or place it gave me lousy, fading-in-and-out sound I found utterly unacceptable,  annoying and unlistenable.  It's now sitting on my bed fading in and out, with static, at the angle I best got any reception.  I have several battery radios that are decades old and use 2 AA batteries that are tons better than this thing.<br /><br />Maybe I got a lemon, but im so sorry the person who got this for me wasted so much money.  As usual, reviews are glowing and the majority so im hoping to give more perspective on this.

786645,3,It's ok for if you're on a budget,"Do you just want a tablet but don't want to spend the couple hundred that most name brand performance tablets costs? Then this may be a tablet you may want as long as you have the tolerance to be dealing with an off brand android tablet.<br />Out of the box, there is a thin plastic screen cover/protector. That's nice, but it not a very swipe friendly surface and may feel a bit of a drag. It also came with a case cover to put the tablet in so it could be propped up on the side.<br />The set up was very slow, much slower than I anticipated with the advertised specs. The screen keyboard sometimes has a long delay before it shows up and I would question if the tablet was even responding to the touchscreen when I needed to fill out the search bar and stuff.<br />I've ran roblox on it and it would be slow and lags at times. I've tried pokemon go with it and it works great for a spread out wide area but suffers badly if you get to an area that is densely populated with gyms and stops.<br />The battery life is poor in my opinion but is close as described on the listing during my frequent usage. The worst part is the stand by or sleep mode. Seems the battery runs down too fast than I would expect if it has nothing running in the background. I would have it fully charged before I unplugged it for the night and then come morning (8-9hrs later) the battery percentage would be around the high 80%. It can do fast charging.<br />Now for the biggest gripe I have with this is the wifi. The wifi works just fine when it is connected. I can search the internet, download apps from the google play store, and connect slowly on games that use online connectivity. The thing I don't like about the wifi functionality is if the tablet is in sleep/standby mode for a long period of time, even if it is 2-4 hours, the internet connection would be disconnected and will not reconnect at all in settings. Only sure way of correcting this is holding the power button down and select the restart option. This is the only way I know of that will bring the internet connection back on the tablet until it does it again soon.<br />If you really want to get this tablet because it's at a cheap price list then be sure to consider what I have described in this review if you will tolerate it daily.",[],B0BLZB88W8,B0C1TWNBGD,AGRSUI4GJTLQ7KSLTMBH57ICZ7ZQ,2023-03-11 03:55:36.350,3,False,505
594759,4,"H Type 2 Pin No Strip Wire Connector - Great for Quick, Non-Mission Critical Applications","In this review, I'll be discussing the H Type 2 Pin No Strip Wire Connector, a product that provides a quick and easy way to splice two wires together without the need for tools or stripping the insulation.<br /><br />What is the H Type 2 Pin No Strip Wire Connector?<br />The H Type 2 Pin No Strip Wire Connector is a small, H-shaped device that is used to connect two wires together by clamping them securely in place. It features a simple, push-together design that allows you to splice the wires together in just a few seconds.<br /><br />How does it work?<br />To use the H Type 2 Pin No Strip Wire Connector, simply push the ends of the two wires you want to splice together into the open ends of the connector. The connector will clamp down on the wires, securing them in place and creating a physical connection between them. No stripping of the insulation is required, and no tools are needed.<br /><br />What's to like?<br />There are several things to like about the H Type 2 Pin No Strip Wire Connector. First and foremost, it is quick and easy to use. Simply push the wires into the connector and you're done. It is also very convenient, as it requires no special tools or equipment. This makes it a great choice for non-mission critical projects where speed and ease of use are more important than a strong, reliable connection.<br /><br />What's not to like?<br />While the H Type 2 Pin No Strip Wire Connector is great for quick, non-mission critical projects, it may not be the best choice for more demanding applications. The connection it provides may not be as strong or reliable as a crimp connector, and it may not be suitable for use in high-voltage or high-current situations. If you need a strong, reliable connection that can withstand high levels of current or voltage, you may want to consider using a crimp connector instead.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />In conclusion, the H Type 2 Pin No Strip Wire Connector is a great product for quick, non-mission critical projects. It is quick and easy to use, requires no special tools, and is convenient to have on hand. However, it may not be the best choice for more demanding applications where a strong, reliable connection is required.

85108,5,Basic laptop with good support,"This is a Windows alternative to those who don’t want a Chromebook or iPad, but do a lot of web browsing and Office applications. This runs Windows 11 Home S Mode out of the box which is excellent for young kids or people who are not tech savvy as you can only run applications that are available through the Microsoft Store which means less chances of viruses and malware. Prepare some time when you first turn it on to install a lot of updates.<br /><br />It’s not the lightest laptop by any means, but typical of this size and price range. The body is made of plastic and feels pretty solid, though I did notice the screen wobble a bit while typing. The matte anti-reflective screen looks gorgeous with good viewing angles and just average brightness. At 15” you have enough space for work and maybe also view a video in the corner, but note it is NOT a touchscreen. There is a webcam on top with average video quality and 2 built-in mics for audio. The keyboard is not backlit, and the trackpad is one solid plate with no buttons. It took me a little to get used to clicking on it as I found it a little on the small side. Speakers are good, but nothing to go wild about. While I like how slim the laptop is I find it difficult to grip the lid to flip it open.<br /><br />Performance on this feels snappy. Web browsing was smooth and fast. It played YouTube videos at 1080 60FPS for 30 minutes straight and no dropped frames. Fans do kick on more than I would like even at idle.<br /><br />On the sides of the laptop you have a Mic/Headphone jack, SD Card slot, 1 USB-C and 2 SuperSpeed USB ports, and an HDMI out port. The processor is a 12th gen Intel Core i3 1215U 1.20GHz with 8GB Ram and 128GB SSD. The battery, hard drive and ram are not user accessible. Bluetooth is available if you are looking to add a mouse, speakers, headphones, etc…<br /><br />Overall I think this is a solid laptop in the low end price range. It has some decent performance boosting to eliminate work flow lag plus HP offers great support for their products. While I don’t recommend this for gaming, if you have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate you can stream games with it (it has Wifi 6.)","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mAU+C-o7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mAU+C-o7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mAU+C-o7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71r83bH1oxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71r83bH1oxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71r83bH1oxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81AyeX2L-uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81AyeX2L-uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81AyeX2L-uL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BVD8LZQL,B0CCGTKMZB,AFVEVWQKZRB5PO3EY3UN4VVADIZA,2023-04-08 03:16:12.627,1,False,505
199086,5,"Amazing Tiny PC; Great for Office Work, Passable for Older Games","I'm working from home these days, so I got this little Small Form Factor (SFF) PC to do my work on.<br />I've been using it at least five days a weeks for months now, and am pleased to report that I'm xtremely happy with it.<br />Here's why I say that:<br /><br />Pros<br />-----<br />*  Tiny.  It can sit largely unnoticed on your desk, especially if you put it behind your monitors.  Alternatively, you could also mount it on the back of a monitor or underneath a desk.<br />*  Powerful.  This PC is more powerful than most of the PCs I've owned throughout my life, and handles day-to-day tasks such as web browsing, creating and viewing documents, web browsing, and listening to music without breaking a sweat.<br />*  Passable (non-AAA) gaming performance.  I tested this little PC with several video games, and was frankly surprised that it could run them at all.  It wasn't able to handle modern AAA titles very well, but older titles - those that have been out for a few years, or those with lower hardware requirements - ran surprisingly well.<br />*  Supports multiple large monitors very, very well.<br />*  Comes with a Windows 11 Pro license, which is worth over $100 on its own.<br />*  Has more than enough ports for most people:  4 USB A ports, 1 USB C port, 2 HDMI ports, a 1G physical Ethernet port, a MicroSD slot (easy way to add more storage for cheap), and a 3.5mm headphone jack.<br />*  Comes equipped with WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 - both of which are surprisingly modern and up to date for such an inexpensive PC.<br />*  Very quiet.<br />*  Clean, minimalist industrial design.<br /><br />Cons<br />-----<br />*  Only one USB C port.  More would have been nice, since USB C is where everything's slowly going.  I'm not deducting a star for this, though, since the description clearly stated that this is the case.<br />*  Manual isn't very useful, so you'd better be comfortable plugging everything in yourself.  This isn't really difficult, but I thought I should mention that it doesn't do much hand-holding.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TFS6qv5AL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TFS6qv5AL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TFS6qv5AL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fKRO3TKaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fKRO3TKaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fKRO3TKaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B97C61WP,B0C77WK3XQ,AEJCSFSBJDYMVZ5Y44YN6WOOSNFQ,2023-01-29 22:33:20.629,0,False,505
81286,3,A good projector with portability and decent sound,"This projector is nice at times and frustrating at other times. I’ve had this for almost a month now and can definitely say it’s not quite as user friendly as I would’ve expected for this price point. The remote is an essential part of this projector. Many of the controls are only available through the remote. That would be fine if the working distance wasn’t 2 to 3 feet from the base unit. You literally cannot sit 5ft away and have the remote work. Once you’ve got your picture set the correct way the picture is average to slightly above average for a 4K projector. One nice feature is that you can project video on the ceiling. It must be used in an extremely dark room to get the full effect. Harmon Kardon has collaborated with this company to provide sound and it does a good job for a Bluetooth speaker. I wouldn’t say it’s outstanding but it’s good enough. My honest opinion is that this will appeal to someone who appreciates the design (and it is a very cool retro design) but not the actual functionality as much. The bottom line to me is that it’s overpriced. There’s no screen mirroring from an iPhone. I contacted the company and they replied to this issue stating that there would be an upcoming app with a technical fix for this problem in the next month or two. As you can see from my first picture,  I plugged in a fire tv box, however my main reason for ordering this was the portability option- being able to screen mirror movies from my phone while camping or traveling. It does have a lithium battery that can last as long as 3 hours for video and longer if you only use the Bluetooth speaker. It also comes with sound deadening discs that are supposed to reduce speaker vibration-you place them under the three pointed brass like pointed feet. That would’ve been a cool touch had this not been designed to be so portable. The discs are separate and not attached or magnetic. Consequently, we’ve already lost one of them…That makes the other two useless…So, it’s a nice Bluetooth speaker that can project video. Not exactly cutting edge stuff but if you like and appreciate really cool, well designed, aesthetic retro items this may appeal to you. Personally, i would’ve liked this a lot more at half the price. I hope that’s been helpful.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61H7ijA7DjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61H7ijA7DjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61H7ijA7DjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PGx9D4CTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PGx9D4CTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PGx9D4CTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mltOShYqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mltOShYqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mltOShYqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714+MovqBCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714+MovqBCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714+MovqBCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rwS2WneCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rwS2WneCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rwS2WneCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09YVL9SYC,B0BZZ6LR4F,AHHTHCSCRUUFJYD4JR7YORVKYSFQ,2023-01-25 05:24:41.670,3,False,505
406004,1,STOPPED WORKING AFTER A MONTH - GOOGLE NIGHTMARE TO WORK WITH FOR REPAIRS,"Watch worked fine for about 3 weeks. Then the battery display was not going down (after 27 hours of being at 94%, which anyone who uses a smartwatch knows the batteries are not that resilient!). Tried charging it, but it didn't fluctuate the battery at all, then tried powering down and restarting. The screen became unresponsive anytime I navigated to it. Couldn't figure out how to get it to respond to anything at this point, the entire watch was just non-responsive. Figured a factory reset would be best option, so I did. Then in reconnecting the phone to the app, this is where everything fell to pieces. It spent 8 hours ""connecting to phone"". Finally contacted Google, who recommended a hard reset (holding the wheel and button for 45 sec). It would then pair to the app, but that is as far as it would go. It sat for hours ""updating watch"". Called Google again. They wanted proof I actually paid for the watch before moving forward with my case. Sent them all documentation to their liking, including proof of purchase, serial number, price paid and from where etc. etc. I was told they would escalate my case and I'd have a resolution within 48 hours. SIX DAYS LATER there is NOTHING, not even a ""Hey, we are still investigating this issue"". Emailed them re: the open case. Nothing. Called again and after 20 minutes of investigation they inform me I need to fill out this email survey (that they should have sent days ago, because that is what they were waiting on to move the case forward) and said they would replace it. Get the email and they asked for EVERYTHING except my firstborn child. Videos of the issue, the purchase confirmations, pictures of the original box, SN, operating versions of watch, app, order numbers. I spent over an hour gathering all their requirements, sent it in, and they kicked it back saying they could not see the screenshots embedded in the email, nor could they open any of the attachments they requested. These are not odd files People, a jpeg, mp4, PDF, C'MON GOOGLE. Resent everything AGAIN. No response yet.

726792,5,No wonder this is one of the most popular IEMs in the market!,"For the last 6 months, I have tested many IEM from $20-$300.  I am surprised how good they are.For the ones I evaluated.  None of them are bad.  In fact, all of them are better than my airpod pros.  Many times better.  Unless you have to have wireless earbuds, there is no reason not to get one of these budget IEM to listen to music.  KZ ZSN Pro X is one of the more popular budget IEMs in the market and one of the earbuds I tested.<br />  <br />There ore tons of YouTube reviews about this IEM.  You can learn about the Pros and Cons from these videos.<br /><br />It comes with a number of silicone ear tips.  You have to try them all to determine which set best fits you.  Ear tips make or break your experience.  If the bass is lacking, it is probably due to poor fit of your ear tips<br />As for the sound quality, I have mixed feelings about it.  It has a V shape sound signature with strong bass and shape highs.  <br /><br />I prefer warm and dark sound.  I love how deep the bass is.  It is punchy.  Sub bass is strong but not muddy.<br /><br />The mids are thick and comfortable. It gives you the sense of weight but not overwhelming.<br /><br />As for the highs, this is my biggest concern.  I found this IEM is more on the bright side.  It can be shouty depending on what kind of music you listen to although the detail is very good.  I can’t listen to it for more than a few hours without feeling fatigued.  But for a quick short session or for a workout, this is perfect.<br /><br />Soundstage is just average.  The sound is more “inside your head’ instead of “outside of head”.  However, the imaging is good.  Instrument separation is surprisingly capable.  I have no problem pinpoint position of different instruments.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great little IEM.  Sounds super engaging.

585114,4,Just what I needed! A bit misleading in the posting...,"The pros:<br /><br />I purchased these for my apartment that moved to where the modem was in the far corner of my apartment away from the main room, and oh boy these were just what I needed! They are so simple to use with just two ethernet cables to clip into both sides, it's as simple as that!<br /><br />The outside is a plastic-like material and the connector insides are metal with chrome finish inside! It looks as good as it does in the image! --- Please keep in mind that not all ethernet cables will ""click"" when inserted into them. I have various ethernet cables that I own and while some have an audible click, others do not. You can see if your cable is in all the way if you gently tug on the cable and see if it slides out. If not, then it's in all the way!<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />I give this 4 stars, mainly because almost everything about this product is perfect, except the listing... I have a 10 gig network in my apartment and these are not capable of handling 10 gig connections... Both couplers I got are incapable of handling 10 gig network speeds. The fastest I got was 2.5 gig speeds. This may be due to the way the couplers are designed, similar to how ethernet cables have to be specially designed for 10 gig speeds (wire quality, thickness, shielding, etc). In the product description, it says can support speeds to 10 gigabit, that is incorrect. Perhaps I got a bad pair and other people can say that they can handle 10 gig/gigabit speeds? But my network interfaces are unable to establish a 10 gig, or even a 5 gig network connection over these. I'm guessing it's probably because the internal bits are not sheilded and there's too much crosstalk with the individual pins.<br /><br />Overall, if you do not need anything over 1 gigabit ethernet speeds, this is a perfect product! It's well-built, it's designed with a very modern look and very simple to use! However...

933746,4,"RGB Fried in less than 2 months. HOWEVER, great customer service!","Read to the bottom to understand four stars.<br /><br />Original Post: Looked amazing. Then the RGB controller dies. I found other people left reviews on Musetex cases here on Amazon that had the same problem. I try to ignore negative feedback and give companies a chance, but this time it backfired (at first: EDIT). I will probably be ordering a case from another manufacturer and returning this one if I can get it done in time. (I did not.: EDIT)<br />Edit: I was contacted by the company and offered both the refund or a replacement control board without waiting on the RMA process. I declined the offer since I had already purchased another controller which is on the way. So with that said, I have increased my star rating for two reasons.<br /><br />1. The company attempted to make it right when seeing what I had to say about my experience.<br />2. The original review should not have been 1 star. The case is well designed for the most part. It is very difficult to find cases which offer tons of features whether or not you use them all.<br /><br />*Update 4/23 and why this review is now four stars: I was sent a completely new fan set which does not rely upon the RBG control card to operate. This gesture was not cheap by any standard. This means I will have to eventually gut the case cooling system and replace the fans to get my RGB back, but it definitely shows dedication to quality to have paid attention and discovered an issue in production, then fix the problem. The new style fans are to be included with future cases, so this problem will most likely be solved by now in cases offered on Amazon.<br /><br />This really was a case design that handled everything I needed, and RGB is a nicety. That RGB doesn't keep my video card and processor from frying. I wish good luck to this case company because I believe they actually care about the end product.<br /><br />To the Designers: I did have to remove the HDD mount in order to use the modular power supply I picked (EVGA 1300W). This meant I have lost a huge backup storage drive I planned on installing with this build and had to settle for USB. So perhaps moving that mount further away from where the power supply will be installed would be a good idea. There was plenty of space toward the front of the case to do so.",[],B09HGXVHGY,B09HGXVHGY,AFOSKLXMHNS4HZJWDCZ6RN664V3A,2023-01-07 02:09:47.534,0,True,505
515499,4,"Very capable PC for the size and price, not a full-blown gaming system","I got this in the hopes of having a much more portable gaming rig. The initial setup could not have been simpler. I went through the OOBE (Out Of Box Experience) with Windows 11 and once I signed in to my Microsoft account, it kinda finished itself. It shipped with Windows 11 Pro 21H2. The solid state drive is plenty fast and the 16 GB of RAM is twice what my regular gaming rig shipped with. Do I wish there was more space on the internal hard drive? Yes, but swapping in a larger M2 2280 drive would be easy with an external adapter and some free online software. There is supposed to be the ability to add a 2.5"" drive to the case, but after taking it apart I was unable to easily discern where that would get hooked up as I didn't see a cable or connector available (see pictures). I am impressed by the responsiveness when doing day-to-day computing: Spreadsheets open quickly, websites render easily, and everything points to this being a very good value for the money. As someone who's used many different 'business-class' laptops over the years, most of which were roughly three times the price of this, you could very easily deploy this PC with a nice monitor or two for folks, and most folks would likely be happier with a real mouse and a full-size keyboard (none of which are included with this PC). I installed Steam and downloaded a first-person shooter from 2011. The in-game movies rendered well and the gameplay was comparable to my full-sized gaming rig. I then installed a current game (still regularly getting updated) to test and see how that worked. I was disappointed to say the least. You could play the current game with this PC, but the video was jerky and not nearly as responsive. I was running the graphics at 1920 x 1080 resolution, I would expect 4k video would be even worse with regards to how many frames per second you'd get. Will this replace my full-sized rig? It will not. But, for the price this is still a very capable little system. While I disagree with the 'Gaming Computer' label, this computer is very quiet, takes up a very small amount of space on your desk (or none if you mount it to the back of a monitor), and would handle pretty much anything short of full-on immersive video gaming with ease. I do feel this PC is still a really good value for the price.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/314wq4GrXSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/314wq4GrXSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/314wq4GrXSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715l1ZRQ32L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715l1ZRQ32L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715l1ZRQ32L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719Gzu1-dBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719Gzu1-dBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719Gzu1-dBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FvPvt169L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FvPvt169L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FvPvt169L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KkqvehtHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KkqvehtHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KkqvehtHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BQW5YF27,B0CB78WQQQ,AFWJYWXSPO5LWZI2BPMNK4KVUKLQ,2023-01-17 12:11:08.556,2,False,505
420777,5,As advertised,"I was an original investor in their kickstarter campaign and received the headphones on Christmas Eve (nice Christmas present).  To this point, I could not be happier.  These headphone are perfect for the remote employee that needs to wear headphones most of the work day.<br /><br />I wear them from 7am to 5pm  (yesterday was the first time that I received a low battery warning) . I have them connected to my computer and to my phone; switching between the 2 works seamlessly.  I go for a 3-4 mile walk daily and listen to audiobooks.  I have had multiple phone calls while on these walks and people cannot tell that I am outdoors because the mic is so good at noise cancelling.  It is so good that a extremely loud garbage truck passed me while on one call and no one on the call was able to hear it.  I don't listen to a whole lot of music, but when I have, sound is extremely good.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* very light and comfortable<br />* connectivity to multiple devices simultaneously<br />* long battery life (10+ hours talk time)<br />* quick charge (30 min max for full charge, 5 min gets a 50% charge)<br />* ability to mute by merely rotating the mic back (can also mute with a mute button)<br /><br />CONS (and these are very petty):<br />* I wish the multi-function button was easier to get to<br />* muting the device is easy and works but it does not seem to communicate this to the connected device.  this means that even though I am actually muted the software (I use Teams) doesn't actually show that I am muted.<br />* my buddy also got a pair but he has a very large head and though they work well for him, they are not comfortable and he therefore does not use them<br /><br />2 Month Update:  Still really love these headphones;  I literally wear them from 7am to 7pm and have only received a low battery warning 2 times.  Recharge to 100% it without fail only 30 min.<br /><br />The noise cancelling microphone is the boss.

725290,5,Impressive! Paired Out of the Box. Nearly Flawless Sound Reproduction for Podcasting & Voice-Overs.,"This review is of the GODOX Mini Mic (2 TX+1 RX+Charging Case), 100m (328ft.) Range, 24-Hour, 2.4G Noise Cancelling Mic, Wireless Microphone for PC, Andriod, Record Interview, Vlogs（White).<br /><br />I have purchased two other wireless mics -- both black -- but they only have the ability to connect to USB-C. And one does not work with my Android phone: Moto G Stylus. The GODOX works well!<br /><br />This GODOX is handier for me because I can use it on devices that only accept 3.5mm TRS or TRRS audio jacks. It ships with 3 adaptors. These are the first that I've seen with swappable adapters. Cool.<br /><br />I have an old computer that I use for some editing and does *not* have a USB-C port. I could probably use a USB-C to USB-A adapter, or a hub but now I don't have to. I can just plug this into the mic jack.<br /><br />Another thing that I like about them is that they're white and blend in with lighter colored clothes.<br /><br />One minor but very cool feature is that the mics snap back into the charger. I don't know if you've ever had the experience when you put a device, or two, on a charger, come back the next day and it's still dead because the contacts didn't quite align properly. Sucks. I doubt that will ever happen with these Godox mics.<br /><br />One feature that would give these mics a 6-star rating from me -- :) -- is if they had a jack to plug in an external mic. So, it would function like a mic-pack that you can hide the pack and only have the tiny mic on your lapel, collar, etc.<br /><br />Of course, I can obtain better sound quality using my wired mics, but for podcasts, Zoom calls, and most voice-overs it's barely noticeable wearing high-quality headphones.<br /><br />Note: the mics I received shipped with protective plastic over the electrodes, so be sure to remove them before charging.<br /><br />All-in-all, I give these mics and accessories 5 stars.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-MDiwXCyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-MDiwXCyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-MDiwXCyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kOr99BfSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kOr99BfSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kOr99BfSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BRYYKJFR,B0BRYYMY3H,AHCHXTHTF4BMOBU5UXAWUXCKZ3WQ,2023-03-25 01:07:46.841,0,False,505
778321,2,What a disappointing flagship for google,"I thought this phone would be a great upgrade for the pixel 5.<br />Unfortunately it was not. The key detractors are the ergonomics, the fingerprint scanner which works so poorly I've just been using my password, and the speed to get to the camera.<br />For the ergonomics: the phone is a two-handed phone in 2023 (2022 release date)! How is it two handed? The point of balance for where you hold it is above your finger and my hands are over 9 inches across. The position of the volume is rather low on the phone likewise the power button is right at 2/3 from the base. This is far too low so when you're holding it if you don't want to manipulate your power button you have to hold it in the bottom one quarter. So the phone becomes completely unstable in your hand unless you're using two hands! Additionally to that it is rather thin so unless you have a case it'll flop around in your hand, then when it does you manipulate the screen. Also the phone is darn slick I had to use duct tape prior to getting a case because it was just fly off a table if it had any sort of incline.<br /><br />The fingerprint sensor is atrocious and in the middle of the screen. So have you using this say at night and you don't want to wake up the person next to you that fingerprint puts a huge white light in your face instead of being on the back of the phone and not causing any sort of light in previous generations. It honestly works so poorly I don't use it at all.<br />The amount of time it takes to get to the camera is ridiculous. iPhone figured this out and has it on the lock screen why can't Google? You have to fully unlock your phone then pull up the camera which takes a while to load and then you can get to whatever setting you want. But then with the poor organomics even if you're in the right setting if you're trying to get that quick shot you might hit and move your phone to a different setting and now you've blown it. I've missed multiple cute shots of my infant because of this. The software they tout for the phone like unblur doesn't work very well. I guess it is sort of cool you can film in portrait mode but that isn't worth $1,000.<br /><br />Tldr stick to the pixel 5 or 6 you already have",[],B0BCQVFQHD,B0BVX6BBMJ,AHLKFII3KSVZ7AUM7AZGY3WR2UZA,2023-01-28 18:59:37.711,0,False,505
236499,5,Excellent Power Strip and  USB Charger,"This product is a very nicely made power strip and USB charger.  It has a flat plug on the heavy-duty extension cord, allowing the strip to be plugged in behind furniture.  It has a sliding bracket that allows the strip to be hung up, which also doubles as a phone stand.  It has 3 AC outlets (which it says have child-protection shutters) and 3 USB charging outlets (a USB A and 2 USB C ports)  It has an on-off switch with power indicators for both the AC and USB outlets.  It also says it has a surge protector.<br /><br />The interesting thing about this strip is that it is capable of smart fast-charging cell phones that have fast-charging capability.  It supposedly supports 14 different fast-charging protocols (who knew there were 14?).<br /><br />I tested this ability with my old LG phone, which does support fast-charging.  My phone has an Micro B type socket (a plug can only be inserted into it one way).  Normally, I fast-charge it from an LG wall wart with a USB A to USB Micro B cord.<br /><br />I used this cord to test the strip's ability to charge my phone.  Using the A socket with my cord, the strip would charge my phone, but it did not fast-charge my phone.  A careful reading of the instructions seemed to say that only the type C sockets support fast-charging.  This would mean that I needed a Type C to Micro B cable, which I did not have.<br /><br />I bought a Type C to Micro B cable, and then tried charging my phone with this cable.  It worked!  It fast-charged my phone from a C port!  So now, I do not need a separate wall wart, since I can fast-charge from this power strip.  The one thing a user definitely needs to know is that in order to use fast-charging mode, you need a cable with a type C plug on one end, and whatever type of plug your phone uses on the other end.  If you only have a cable with a USB A plug on one end, you will be able to charge, but not fast-charge.  With a cable that uses the the strips C port, you are all set.<br /><br />I was very favorably impressed with this power strip, and give it my high recommendation.",[],B0BRKB14QL,B0BRKB14QL,AE6ETJKWBVG356OQDF2D5SCNRAWQ,2023-02-12 18:54:23.736,0,False,505
873618,5,"Love, love, love, and love...","So good, I bought two instead of one Marshall Middleton. As wanted, I pair them together to get surround sound, smaller size, and save about $50. Although I own two pairs of Marshall headphones which I'm taking with me to Heaven, at that time - it took awhile for me to commit to buying the speakers. That's because I already own a pair of off-brand Bluetooth speakers that sound so much better and lasts many hours longer than more expensive Beats, Bose, Sony, etc. They have all the other bells-and-whistles specifications, including USB-C, rapid charging, 20+ hours playtime and only cost $30 each. The seller stopped selling them on Amazon.<br /><br />Emberton II was a huge jump in price. The difference from Emberton I - is it will pair with other Marshall speakers.  But only the latest models like the Middleton or more Emberton IIs. Also, the Emberton II has a grain texture finish. The hardest part about buying Marshall products is knowing if you actually got authentic products. Knock-offs provide knock-off quality and it hurts the reputation of genuine products with bad reviews. I won't describe the differences in great details. The box is printed on all sides that spills over to other sides. It looks and feels real money, very expensively printed. Inside packaging and booklets too.  The speaker is very well crafted down to the smallest details and feels solid. The grills are finished very well, individually, without any rough edges or mistakes and so is the Marshall signature emblem. Look closely.<br /><br />The Emberton II sound quality is phenomenal for all music genres. It's a work of art pumping out sound, spatially separating all the tracks of instruments and voices, to hear them together in one song. This is studio quality at a reasonable price. It exceeds my $30 pair, which already beat-out all the other more expensive speakers, in the only way it could. I heard sounds playing in music I've heard so many times, I can replay it verbatim in my head. Some folks might scoff at this price point comparison. But if I'm completely satisfied at $30 or $170 - no one can entice me to spend $1500 or $15,000 I can afford to pay too. I might purchase more Emberton II's to install wireless speakers throughout the house.

I need it to crank up (PRIOR MILITARY HERE) and do that job without the batteries.  Also during hurricanes and severe FLOODING etc, THIS FEATURE IS the most important element.<br />One thing I will make clear is all phones have a USB cord, so NO matter your phone, rest assure it will go into the USB port.  NOW I do have an issue even after CRANKING it FOREVER and it did nothing, then plugged it in and hooked up my phone did nothing.  And did batteries (WASTE OF TIME FOR EMERGENCIES)  and still did not work.  I am technically sound and know how to do things.<br />In a disaster, you need this to work as it should....CRANK and go...  I find this NOT representing what it says as I am testing it out for disasterous situations..  Do research, but and test.  DO it like another review said, before you need it and it is not working.  ALL items sold and advertised as a necessary survival piece of equipment should function as they say!!!  Or that is basically saying ""OH WELL... We used terms and language that made it SEEM the ultimate survival item...""<br />I get selling things and making a profit is important, but imblesshing is not a good thing.  I am NOT in anyway steering you away from this, I am just saying (If war happens, or A hurricane, tornado ETC comes, you need what works.)  And you do not and will not have access to batteries NOR to plug it in.  So try it for yourself.  NOW IS THE TIME.... DO NOT wait.  But I do encourage you to not depend on using any other ability for this to work other than the crank and the solar....  THAT IS the survival aspect....  Just a heads up.<br />Also a question I wonder is if they are not saying we have to download an app???  I think I am going the military route.

322550,4,"ST40 - Great (and large) BT speaker, not so great app","After preparing to shred the crummy Samsung app running on my Samsung S21 for this Samsung speaker, I see the shortcomings of the app are pretty well covered in other reviews here and instead I'll rate this just as a large bluetooth speaker and keep it simple. My current use has been around the house and when working out in the basement. Planned use includes tailgating and backyard in the summer.<br /><br />Good:<br />- Streaming music from my phone sounded great (Spotify, high bit rate setting)<br />- Lots of thump from the bass with or without the extra bass setting (most useful at lower volumes)<br />- Plenty loud on battery (80w max), louder still plugged in (160w max)<br /><br />Bad or Meh:<br />- I have to manually connect to it in BT settings every time I use the speaker (maybe just a me thing)<br />- Speaker volume and phone/BT volume are separate. i.e. for max volume I have to turn up the speaker using the buttons on it, as well as turn up the volume on my phone.<br />- The app (it had potential but is just so half baked)<br /><br />OK I can't ignore the app. I thought other reviewers just gave up too soon, I'm super good with tech and can figure it out... Sorry for doubting you other reviewers. Ignoring how hard it was to get it to connect to the speaker (which drops whenever the phone sleeps) and eventually losing connection until rebooting the phone a few times... I did try out the various sound modes (DJ effects) using MP3's from a USB drive. The effects are pretty lame, but I was hoping a combination would be funny (e.g. crank up wah-wah mode and also speed it up) but you can only use one effect at a time. See attached photo (from the app) showing the modes - you can cycle through them on the remote, from the panel on the speaker, or directly from the app. Using one cancels the other you were using. Given the lights, effects, and MP3 file from USB input I feel like the extras would have been amazing around 2002-2010.

993924,1,Lights Come On . . . But No One's Home,"I was topping off my new DTV antenna system and decided to measure signals from various towers.  I decided I needed a signal meter. Read all the reviews for this meter and it looked like a 50/50 proposition whether it would work.  Bought it on the 50/ side that worked.  That's the intent.  Here's the fact.  The meter showed up on time.  I read the instructions, attached the power supply with a 9v battery, the light came on.  Attached the new antenna's coax to the meter, pointed the antenna south.  Meter read ""1"".  The antenna is known ""good"" as I had tested it in a dry assembly the previous day.  The antenna pulled in 51 stations when pointed south where I had only been able to get 17 previously.  Not the first time I might have done something wrong so I reread the instructions.  Adjusted the meter so that there would be no artificial reduction in input strength. Meter still read ""1"".  Remove the 60' antenna cable and attached a production 12' cable. Meter read ""1"". Completely removed the coax from the meter.  With no coax attached the meter still read ""1"".<br /><br />I got bit by the /50 downside.  Shame on me.  I would return it but someone would probably resell it to another customer so I'll  toss it into the trash instead.  Nice box though.<br /><br />Feb 2 2023 Update:<br />Since I had decided to trash this thing I decided I had nothing to lose taking it apart.  Uses a very small star screw  (I have the tools).  I thought I'd maybe find a bad connection or something obvious.  Removed the screws, cut the warranty tamper seal and opened the case.  Couldn't see anything obvious with the PC broad or physical elements so I put the shell back on.<br /><br />Decided to try one other thing to see  what happened.  Assembled the system with the antenna and a signal booster, wala, the signal meter maxed out when the squelch nob was turned down, so the device does do something when fed and artificial load but was uncontrollable i.e. either 0 or 10, nothing in between.  Removed the booster, connected meter to the antenna - meter read ""1"".  Today is trash day.

451573,5,"Does the job, it's a got a 7.4mm plug","This AC adapter has a 7.4mm DC plug!  NOT 4.5mm as another review states.  The product description itself says, ""Connector Size: 7.4 X 5.0(mm)"".  The description is accurate!<br /><br />This AC adapter is identical in shape, size and LED placement to the original Dell that came with my Dell WD19S docking station.  I replaced the Dell with this one, and it worked perfectly without any issues.  My 2020 Apple Macbook Pro M1 connected to the Dell WD19S dock with this powering the entire setup worked just fine.  No issues whatsoever.  As for temperature, it only gets lukewarm to the touch.<br /><br />There are some electrical differences, so it's definitely not a 100% clone of the original Dell adapter.  The Dell adapter measures 19.1V no load voltage, this one measures 19.58V.  The green indicator LED is not as bright or as diffused as the Dell.  With no load, after unplugging the Dell, the green LED stays lit 40.71 seconds before it goes completely dark.  This one, it stays lit 23.80 seconds.  This doesn't mean one is better than the other, just that they are different designs.  I don't have the equipment to do a scientific test and verify whether the adapter is stable up to the rated 180W, but it'll do fine to power and charge a modern laptop + dock + external keyboard & mouse.<br /><br />Someone mentioned it's FCC certified, but he couldn't find an FCC ID.  This was not the case with mine.  It's KCC certified (Korean FCC) with an ID of MSIP-REM-DVP-ADP-180MBK.  It's listed on the FCC site as ""Manufactured by DELTA ELECTRONICS, INC. (Delta Electronics (Jiangsu) Ltd.)""  The original Dell was made by Liteon.  As to whether Delta makes good power supplies, a search came up with this result, ""Delta is one of the biggest and easily one of the most reputable power supply OEMs in the business, one of their big markets being high-reliability server products. Their build quality is consistently excellent as is their performance and reliability.""  As to whether it's really a Delta inside, that I can't say for sure.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DMjNTDjFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DMjNTDjFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DMjNTDjFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZiIW4kpOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZiIW4kpOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZiIW4kpOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614hxBjN+pL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614hxBjN+pL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614hxBjN+pL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617ng+KgAdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617ng+KgAdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617ng+KgAdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B9BH18QY,B0B9BH18QY,AFURBUI2FWOE3WP7MHNN3Z3SDDXQ,2023-02-12 21:07:51.655,0,False,505
998340,5,The best RGB LED Light I have owned so far,"As a content creator and photographer, lighting is one of the most important aspects of getting good results.<br /><br />Over time I have acquired an assortment of about 20 different LED lights.<br />Of them all my favorite ""type"" is the low profile, edge lit, battery powered LED panels.<br /><br />The issue I have with the others I own is output.  Either they can not get bright enough for a large scene, or sometimes I actually have an issue where they can not get dim enough without over powering the scene I am trying to set up.<br /><br />This is what I would consider my first ""PRO"" quality light, as apparent by the fact its labeled as pro, but also other other things like the Pelican style hard case, DMX control, and of course the OUTPUT.<br /><br />This one light will easily put out as much light as the other 4 I have with a similar design, it has a much much higher build quality.<br /><br />So it has now become my favorite light for sure, and it allows me to do some new things that I could not do before.<br /><br />The only warnings I would give, this much power needs a fan, when it is on you can hear the fan if you are close to it.  So if your someone who needs a silent setup, this is not it.  However I do not hear the fan on any microphones, only if I am in a quiet room and no other sound is happening.<br /><br />Second is this lights design is both it's biggest strength and also its biggest weakness.<br /><br />The ""edge lit"" LED design gives a WONDERFUL light diffusion, so you can get soft light without the need for a huge modifier.  In my small studio space, this is why these kind of lights are my favorite.<br /><br />However that also means, this thing fills a room with light, unlike a COB light, or the more direct LED lights that are more focused this is a big wide spread.<br /><br />You can at least buy barn doors and a honeycomb filter to add to it to change the light pattern and control it more, again another feature my other lights do not have, but a fair warning for someone looking to add a spot of color to a scene and then suddenly the entire scene is now lighting up with this light.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-g-su0qoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-g-su0qoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-g-su0qoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+wnv9chUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+wnv9chUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+wnv9chUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QGibskusL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QGibskusL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QGibskusL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jeLp6okyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jeLp6okyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jeLp6okyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71k981NSmoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71k981NSmoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71k981NSmoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wta1u1WZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wta1u1WZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wta1u1WZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BV9NKJF7,B0BV9NKJF7,AHNJ756XSZXVTYKREUM4SVMEI5AQ,2023-02-22 16:35:29.492,0,True,505
259269,5,A great stand for the IPad Mini 6,"Packaging: I've used Pitaka products for a while and as usual their packaging felt premium, earth conscience and thought out to help me understand how to set up the device. You're welcomed with an introduction to their ecosystem and given instructions on a piece of translucent paper for how to install the base into the mount arm using the included hex screws and hex driver (which is cleverly attached magnetically underneath and hidden from sight so you don’t lose it). Included was the USB C to USBC cord but you'll have to buy the charging adapter separately that is compatible with USB C PD charging. Luckily I had one but I do wish it was included. Not a big deal for most since I think at this point most people have spares.<br /><br />Setup/Mount: Setting up the stand was simple. Fasten the 2 hex screws (appreciate they are hex and not Phillips or flat) of the base to the mount arm. Make sure to push the base and mount arm all the way together to ensure screw holes are aligned! The build quality of the mount was impressive and had a premium weight to. Then just plug the included USB C cable into the base on one side and into your power adapter on the other. The base has a nice notch for cable routing and strain relief as well (another nice well thought out touch). Once you’re powered up there’s a nice LED at the bottom of the base that cycles through some colors at power on indicating it’s on and ready!<br /><br />Charging: This stand does require the Pitaka MagEZ Case Pro for the iPad Mini 6 to function as intended. Just install your iPad to the case and the case will SNAP to the stand with a very strong magnetic connection and start charging. At the base of the stand is another Qi charger that worked for my iPhone 14 pro and AirPods Pro with no issue (and also includes a nice status lights while charging). While mounted the stand offers tilt functionality and rotation of the iPad to dial in the position as needed. I do wish the height was also adjustable as I did find the height a little tall but it’s possibly better for ergo and posture to be at this height.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: Pitaka has another great product for the iPad product series. If you’re looking for a stand to prop up your iPad Mini 6 for increased productivity then look no further.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TEOgNLxiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TEOgNLxiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TEOgNLxiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ve0Hjck7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ve0Hjck7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ve0Hjck7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09YTT8Z8B,B0BZ7VRMN5,AHVV6645T6RC2K6LHA6X4WP7U6PA,2023-01-05 22:50:24.065,0,True,505
334805,4,Nice Performance for a Budget Device...butt....,"For a budget tablet you get a very well made device. At first glance it looks and feels on par with the big names in the tablet space. Nice presentation when you open the box.  You get a USB cable, charger, Sim tool and your paperwork . Mine came with enough charge to get things setup, Google, Microsoft and Amazon.  Once all the updates and all my apps were installed, I put it through a few web things.  Websites seem to open as fast as most of my other devices. I  have a lot of other devices (ios,windows)to compare this performance against. The processor and the 8gb of ram makes for a good budget to midrange performance on most tasks. I  see this device as primary a entertainment and lite gaming use. I  got great start and stop times opening and closing websites and apps. I  was a little disappointed that Netflix is only in 480p or something like that.  The device is only Widevin level3. Having said that, for me with a10.4 inch screen on Netflix, HBO and Prime Video still looks fine. If Teclast has a software fix please let it rip.....please.<br />As for gaming, I  tried some of the Play Store ones, Temple Run,Call of Duty and Pub G just for the heck. They all seem fine for me but I suck at most games. Gaming will take a toll on the battery which brings me to my biggest problem.  The battery life is not its strongest suit.  Even with the brightness at 60 or 70 percent its still  not great. I am using a 20 watt charger because the one included is slow and cannot keep up if you are using the device (it seems to me)<br />I still have to say that this is still very much worth the money. When  compared against some of the other lesser known budget brands around. There's a quality in this device that you would be hard pressed to find. So far ,so good.  If you are new to Android tablets ,I would say this could be a good starting point. I think  Teclast has a new T50 that has Widevine level 1 and a Unisoc processor.  I probably would have purchased had I seen it before I got this one. Overall I am happy with this one. BTW....it works very well as a remote to my Windows PC which I have not from some of my other budget tablets.",[],B0BJ6XDFQK,B0BJ6XDFQK,AFLDRFPCT3FPHW5ZYZVTG23XETYA,2023-04-19 00:46:23.629,1,True,505
147117,4,Really cool modern CD player,"I've been streaming music for years now, but was recently give an CD to listed to.  I soon realized I didn't have a CD player anywhere in the house.  Luckily, I stumbled across this one and ordered it.<br /><br />Let me start by saying, I love the way this thing looks!  It's about 100 times cooler looking than any CD player I had back in the day.  No cheap plastic and flimsy door that pops up.  This thing looks really cool, fairly solid for a CD player, and I love the metal (copper?) door on top.<br /><br />One of the things I really like about this is that you have the option to use headphones/aux cable or you can use Bluetooth.  Bluetooth wasn't even an option in CD's heyday and so it's a little weird to see it here, but it works great.  I was able to get this thing connected to my Bluetooth speak in less than a minute and it sounded great!  I also used it with headphones, and again, no trouble whatsoever.<br /><br />My only real objection to this CD player, and the reason I took off a star, is because the buttons are super difficult to see.  Except for the top, the whole CD player is black - kind of like a soft black silicone feel.  The buttons are coated in the same material and are all black.  I'm able to use the CD player, but it's really difficult to see which buttons are which and I frequently hit the wrong button when trying to pause or skip a track.  Maybe will a bunch more use I'll be able to memorize the button order, but I'm not sure I'm going to use it that much.  I mostly wanted it to listen to one particular CD and though I may listen to some of my old CD collection, but I think I'm likely to continue streaming music.  I'm going to keep this thing handy in case I want to listen to one of my CDs, but I'll probably never get to the point where I memorize which buttons are which.<br /><br />This CD player is probably best for someone who will use it frequently or someone who will use it at home or work (I don't think it'd be good to try figuring out the buttons while driving).<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a really nice, well-designed CD player.",[],B0B2JGYNBX,B0BVPLJG6Z,AENZK6OIT4LPJ6ZKFU56PHFIK7IA,2023-02-03 12:34:02.061,0,False,505
386287,4,"Works, but who is this for?  A solution in search of a problem.","This is an off-board (e.g., not on the iPad) charger for a 2nd Gen Apple Pencil.  You may ask yourself why you need such a device when the Pencil charges when magnetically attached to the iPad itself?  Well, I'm asking myself that question too.<br /><br />First of all, I will say the unit works.  It feels pretty well made, has a nice charge indicator light and is straightforward to use.  Thanks to the Pencil's magnetic attachment, it is a little cumbersome to dig the pencil out of the charger well, but that's not a big deal.  It has a rubberized bottom to help it stay put on your desk.<br /><br />I just don't see a scenario in my own life when I'll end up needing this.  It proved not as easy to use as the typical attachment to the iPad and I don't really want to carry another device with me.<br /><br />I suppose the one use case I can imagine is if you are someone who is just a rabid user of your Apple Pencil, such that you are always burning through the battery and want a backup ready to go.  But the Pencil has such a quick recharge ability that I think next to no one would be stuck in a situation like that.  But maybe there are a few of you out there.  If so, this can help with your Pencil battery anxiety.<br /><br />For everyone else, this is probably a solution to a problem that doesn't exist for you.<br /><br />Wanted to provide an update: the seller noted that this is targeting those who have cases on their iPads and cannot use the built-in charging mechanism of the iPad.  I don’t think there are a ton of cases for the iPad Pros or Airs (that use the pencil 2) that don’t have the appropriate cut out on the charging magnet side, but I suppose in those cases, this could be a helpful tool — recognizing this will NOT be able to help you pair your Pencil to your iPad.  But you really only need to do that once.  So I’m adding a star since they have reminded me there is — for a small user base — a need.  I still don’t love how it’s a bit difficult to remove the pencil once it’s in the charging well…",[],B0BLMKNLVS,B0BLMKNLVS,AGTINTNN23VP23YXQHZAX7RV7DEQ,2023-02-04 01:27:30.706,0,False,505
63420,4,great little speaker - but no instructions,"This little speaker has great sound quality. I am pretty impressed with how good it sounds. I had it out on my porch today while I was working out in the yard, and it was loud enough and the music was crystal clear, you'd never guess it was coming from this tiny little device. It's small enough to throw in your purse and take to the park, pool or beach, too. Love that it's rechargeable.<br /><br />It is pretty cute too, with rose gold metallic color and multicolor lights that glow at the bottom. It comes with a charging cable and a suction cup, which is just your basic clear suction cup. Not sure how that would hold up in the shower, so I'm just going to use the silicone strap attached to it to hang it while I use it in there. I ordered this mostly so I can listen to audiobooks while I get ready in the mornings, but I think it's great and will use it elsewhere as well.<br /><br />The one drawback to note about this speaker is that it didn't come with any instructions, as far as I could find. The listing says there should be a user guide, but I didn't get one. I eventually figured out that there are buttons in the silicone base all the way around the bottom of the device -- one is a power button, then there's a play button and left and right buttons that control volume. I only knew how to pair it because I've paired similar devices before. (Power it on, go to your phone's bluetooth settings, find it on the list, connect - this was quick and easy and worked perfectly). Then you can play music, podcasts, audiobooks, etc. from your phone on the speaker.  You can't go super far away from the speaker with your phone, though ... maybe 30-40 feet before the sound gets glitchy if there are walls between your phone and the speaker.<br /><br />Instructions would be really helpful, as I am sure it has functions that I haven't figured out yet. Also no idea if it's possible to turn the lights on and off while playing music. Surely there's a way to do that, but no instructions. Can't find instructions online, either. Will come back to read comments to see if anyone has figured out any other functionality that I haven't discovered yet, or if others got a user guide that they share pictures of.",[],B0BPY75QJ7,B0BPY4MLLG,AEPCB4JAZH3QDTYHFQPBHOU543WQ,2023-03-06 02:53:03.168,0,False,505

Also, these seemed idea for visiting theme parks, when the kids want to go on thrill rides and we're happier with more relaxing attractions.<br /><br />In other words, we hoped to use these walkie-talkies to remain in contact, letting each other know when and where to meet up again.<br /><br />After testing these, I can recommend these for emergency use. I think it'd be wise to have one of these in the car's glove compartment and one at home, and maybe another in a friend or relative's home.<br /><br />But that's all. They're not suited to our needs.<br /><br />Here's why: The sound quality is good. The design is pretty good in terms of ease of use, after reading the instructions. The ability to recharge it is good, though we might have liked a longer battery life.<br /><br />Also, it seems to have good range, though we haven't tested the full range (described as 30+ miles) yet.<br /><br />But right away, we spotted something that's an issue for us.<br /><br />It's the belt clip. I'm pretty sure it's plastic, but whatever the material, it's brittle and only a very tiny piece of plastic holds the clip onto the walkie-talkie.<br /><br />If you press against it, the clip practically falls off. If you sit down so your thigh pushes against the walkie-talkie, the clip fails.<br /><br />Worse, gravity works against the clip, not with it. A simple redesign would make 100% different, if it was an S-shaped clip that's more sturdy and works with gravity.<br /><br />If you're not going to use the belt clip, this might be a five-star item. (The battery life is still an issue for me, but maybe not for others.)<br /><br />For us, the brittle quality of the belt clip, and how easily it pops off, means I can give this just four stars.

539584,4,Built in Privacy!,The XPCAM 4K is perfect for using on my desktop computer. The camera worked immediately after plugging the usb into my motherboard. I didn’t have to download any software or do any updates. It worked on windows Camera app and also on OBS. OBS immediately found the camera and I was able to very easily set it up in a new scene.<br /><br />I am glad this camera comes with an internal privacy cover. This is especially important as my computer is located in a bedroom where I do get changed in often. It is very easy to slide the cover over the lens to create less worry.  The camera also has a tiny front light to indicate when it is turned on.<br /><br />The camera is a little bigger than I expected. I was worried the mount wouldn’t work well but I have had no problems with it. It just sort of sits on top of your monitor and you fold in the back side. It isn’t a tight fit at all. It also comes with a tripod stand that you can use if you don’t want to place it on top of the monitor.<br /><br />In the Microsoft Camera app you can select 8.0MP 3264x2448 resolution a 4:3 ratio at 25 fps. This might not be considered true 4k and many won't like the 4:3 ratio as most screen ratios are 16:9. If you want a 16:9 ratio you need to go down to 2k resolution. You are also able to choose a 50hz or 60hz refresh rate. But for me these details don’t matter that much knowing most people will be looking at my face through a phone or 1080p resolution computer screen.<br /><br />The microphone worked fairly well. My program auto selected it when my headset wasn’t turned on. I didn’t notice at first and everyone on the call seemed to hear me fine. It was slightly annoying that when I did turn off the mic on my headset the program we used would switch to the camera’s microphone. I had to make sure I hit mute in the program’s settings instead of on my headset. This isn’t the fault of the camera but the program trying to switch to a connected microphone.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with this web cam. I will be using it for light streaming and conference calls.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41sU0Mph2cL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41sU0Mph2cL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41sU0Mph2cL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61I1xXhBhmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61I1xXhBhmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61I1xXhBhmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61eAvVFacpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61eAvVFacpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61eAvVFacpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BK91D4JD,B0BK91D4JD,AE6PZDY4EWATROZXDCA3KEIY3ENA,2023-02-01 06:16:24.435,0,False,504
184667,2,"Instructions are lacking, wobbles, plastic joints. Phone holder and ball head attachments are nice.","You’re going to need to assemble this by trial and error, as the instructions are very lacking. The “instruction” sheet is printed front and back with the identical content in English on both sides. No reason to have printed it twice. I put “instruction” in quotes because there are two tiny instructions and lots of marketing material. The instructions really aren’t that helpful anyway.<br /><br />When I first assembled this, I put it together upside down and couldn’t for the life of me see how to attach the ball head piece to the stand. It looked like I was missing a piece, but I wasn’t (at least I don’t think so.) when I took the stand out of the base and unscrewed the end to expose a hidden thread area, I found I could flip it over in the base and attach the ball head to the other end. You won’t find that in the instructions, or any indication that the cap at the end unscrews besides fiddling around with it.<br /><br />There also weren’t any instructions for the phone holder. Initially I thought it wouldn’t fit my phone at all because it looked too skinny.<br /><br />TIP: Pull the sides apart to stretch it wider than your phone, beset your phone and release the sides. It will now securely grip your phone.<br /><br />The phone holder screws into the ball head, and that can be adjusted to any angle with the knob. The ball head piece screws into the stand after unscrewing the cap on the skinny end of the stand. Both of these two accessories are decent quality.<br /><br />Once assembled and adjusted to the angle you like via the knobs, tighten everything up. You’ll find that the stand still wobbles. It did not feel very secure at all. I think it would hold my phone OK, but I wouldn’t trust anything the slightest bit heavy (or expensive) to this stand. Plastic wasn’t the right choice.<br /><br />Between the lack of meaningful instructions (or even a good diagram), and the wobble, I can’t rate this very high. It might be just what you need, but I’d prefer something more stable, that could hold more weight securely, and came with better documentation than this.",[],B0BLKHPM53,B0BLKHPM53,AGVVWEPZ2HPPWSSX627EKFUZFZNA,2023-04-02 22:34:00.936,0,False,504
665462,5,"Solid, professional quality extendable boom arm with 3/8 and 1/4"" mounts","This thing is amazing! I was really expecting a somewhat flimsy, consumer-grade boom arm.<br /><br />Not even close. This boom arm is made with a heavy-gauge steel mounting plate and bracket, with an aluminium extendable boom. It comes with concrete anchors for mounting onto concrete or cinder blocks, as well as a set of wood screws for screwing into wall studs.<br /><br />It should be noted that the picture in the listing shows the unit mounted upside down! The straight boom arm goes on the top, and the angled support arm goes on the bottom.<br /><br />Once installed, you can swing the boom from side to side, as well as up and down. The angle up and down is held in place by tightening the clamp on the support arm, and once it is tight, it is SOLID.<br /><br />The boom has a clamp at the end that when loosened, extends out almost five feet! At the end is another clamp that holds a reversible screw mount in either a side orientation or straight out. This reversible mount has a 3/8"" screw mount on one end and a 1/4"" screw mount at the other.<br /><br />In practice, this mount can easily hold the weight of a DSLR or box light. I don't know what the rating of this boom arm is, but it feels solid enough that I would easily trust it with a 15 pound load, and even more if it was not extended all the way. It's that solid.<br /><br />It has a foam grip to grab and move the boom around, and included several self-adhesive velcro wire ties. It also came wrapped with a couple pieces of plastic for some reason, which unfortunately left a mark on the paint when I unwrapped it.<br /><br />This boom is a game-changer for my studio, getting cluttering tripods out of the way and making lights and cameras alwasy easy and quickly at hand.<br /><br />Who is this for?<br />- Anyone needing overhead or steady support for cameras or lights<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Very strong, sturdy<br />- Flexible positioning up to 5 feet away, at various heights<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I wish there was a friction adjustment for the side-to-side adjustment","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Hnw14wuuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Hnw14wuuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Hnw14wuuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6163764DklL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6163764DklL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6163764DklL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RmKdbq3mL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RmKdbq3mL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RmKdbq3mL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YYX3nDChL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YYX3nDChL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YYX3nDChL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zgSNhO+SL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zgSNhO+SL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zgSNhO+SL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-Q2Pjfg-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-Q2Pjfg-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-Q2Pjfg-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SQIhhO-kL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SQIhhO-kL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SQIhhO-kL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WH7Cs2JoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WH7Cs2JoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WH7Cs2JoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xFRb+tqDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xFRb+tqDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xFRb+tqDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BYDPZDDM,B0BYDPZDDM,AFKLEWKUWGN64XSFEDPRC7H67ILQ,2023-04-19 02:35:30.955,1,False,504
106912,4,"Well featured miniPC, if only it had more USB-C ports!","This is a great alternative to an Intel NUC, even though it skimps on a few features and upgradability options.  Removing four screws on the bottom reveals two m.2 slots, one populated with a 512GB SATA SSD.  Note that the slots will support NVMe SSDs, the SATA one tops out at around 520 MB/s.  An NVMe SSD should get multiples of that performance, and should make the machine feel more performant.  Note that only 2280 size m.2 SSDs will fit.  Any other size will require a thin adapter.  While peeking around,  you can see the wireless (802.11ac) card tucked away in a corner.  I am going to look into popping in a wifi 6 capable card in there soon.<br /><br />16GB of memory is a great configuration for a integrated solution like this.  Usually these configurations start at 8GB.<br /><br />Windows 11 Pro is included, which was a pretty pleasant surprise.  The key is already pre-loaded, so no need to fish around for that.<br /><br />A couple of nits.  Only one USB-C port.  And it isn't even USB PD.  I use a thunderbolt KVM, and the USB-C port wouldn't pass through the video signal.  That forced me wire the machine up with HDMI to a dedicated monitor instead.  My KVM passes through USB PD as well, which makes for a single cable solution for power/video/data/keyboard/mouse.  The lack of support in this machine negates that excellent feature.<br /><br />The memory doesn't seem to be upgradable, but I didn't go beyond opening the bottom panel.  There is what looks to be a button on top, but it doesn't do anything.  It seems like that's a location for a fingerprint sensor which was not included with the particular variant I received.<br /><br />Finally, there is a fan and it seems to ramp up and down a fair amount.  The good news is that it is very quiet.  Even running benchmarks didn't seem to make the top of the machine feel even remotely warm.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good miniPC to use as a media player or a medium duty desktop use machine.

10046,1,"Great product, but the support is terrible.","So I purchased this after hearing some promising stories about the company. So I was willing to give them a shot. I was in the process of doing a big upgrade to my pc for streaming purposes.<br /><br />The performance and speed all seemed to show that this was indeed a fast and reliable ssd, it started showing some bizarre behavior. Anytime the pc was reset either manually or when an update requires a pc reboot I would end up in the bios. And the ssd was not detected. I eventually found out I could hold down the power button for a few seconds and I could boot back into my pc. I didn’t suspect the ssd at first and assumed it was my windows install. So I did a completely fresh install and the issue remained. I made sure everything possible was updated to the latest firmware and bios settings. No success. I ultimately decided to live with it. It didn’t crash while gaming or streaming so I assumed it was fine.<br /><br />I recently did a motherboard and CPU upgrade and the issue was still there. So at this point the PC had everything replaced with the exception of the ssd. So at this point I’m certain it’s the ssd and reach out to Sabrent. After registration and pictures of the purchase recipe they also wanted me to take front and back pictures of the ssd. Their solution was for me to send the ssd to them and they would determine after inspection if they would send me a new one. Mind you this PC is my only one and I use it to stream. So after asking them how long it would take they explained it could be two weeks or more. I ask for an alternative and they tell me to buy another ssd from the Amazon seller and they’d reimburse me if they found that my drive was faulty.<br /><br />So either go two weeks without my PC or shell out another $200 and potentially be told that they can’t reproduce the error and not refund me. At this point I’ll be looking to return to Samsung. Who offer a cross shipping replacement so you can copy your files from your old drive to your replacement. Which unless Sabrent makes that offer in the future will mean they’ve lost me as a customer in the future.

969516,2,You can do better for $80,"For some context: I purchased these to replace my Jabra 75t elites. I have some airpods, airpod pro 2s and several truly wireless Anker products. These rank lowest for me for the following reasons:<br /><br />The fit: the shape and material of the ear tips make keeping these in very difficult. They fall out after about 10mins in my ears, it's worse with going to the gym.<br /><br />The touch sensitivity: when they do start sliding out, grabbing the base to readjust them into your ears almost always pauses them or skips your song. This can also be caused by a beanie moving against them, or hugging someone. They are too sensitive to touch. Granted: they give awesome haptic ( it gives the illusion of a physical sensation) feedback when you do press the touch controls.<br /><br />Sound: these sound good, but not great. For $80 ( what I paid for them on sale) they only sound marginally better than my cheaper Anker earbuds like the spirit dot 2s which can be had for around $20 now. They are better than airpods, and a little worse than the jabras due to no sound customization.<br /><br />Noise cancelling: The noise cancelling itself is pretty good. Far better than jabras, maybe 70% of what apple does, but the pressure it creates in my ears is worse than the others. After about an hour of wearing these I start getting a headache. I'm not sure why, but this never happens with my other buds and it consistently happens with these.<br /><br />The case: It's okay, Hard to know which side to open without looking, but it does the job and has some nice features.<br /><br />Battery: battery is good, better than jabras, worse than Anker's and apple pros.<br /><br />Overall, I would avoid these. It's probably worth mentioning I have a One plus device ( 7pro) and even with the added features of connecting easily, it still doesn't make them worth it. I would prefer the jabras ( which I paid $70 for on sale) over these any day. If they stayed in my ears better and the touch controls were less sensitive, I would keep them.

573294,4,Great but died after a couple years..,"[[VIDEOID:d2f8b1a75decf1f2f1ee0e892fbab8b0]] I bought these in January 2021, after buying them on a whim. Luckily they sounded amazing! Wanted to hear every song I liked thru them, which didn’t disappoint. Everything was great and dandy for awhile, I used to listen to them everyday on my bus ride to and from work, but in August of 2022, I began driving to work again. Put these in my center console just in case I’d need them for driving or whatever. Last night I pulled them out 3/19/2023, but they were dead, so I plugged them into charge all night. This morning I checked and it seemed like they charged, took them out of the case, they paired with my phone immediately, I didn’t do anything they just started playing thru the earbuds themselves, thought all was great but then 5 mins later, I heard the dreaded, “battery is low,” message thru the earbuds. That crushed my hopes, I knew they had sufficient time to charge, 10 hours should be good right? Well I plugged them in again but this time noticed the charging lights would flicker instead of showing a steady charge, which would light up the 5 lights in a sequence, 1,2,3,4,5. Instead 1 would flicker, 2-3 would light up for a millisecond and turn off, 4-5 didn’t light up at all. I went ahead and left it there for a couple hours hoping for the best but when I came back, pulled them out tried listening to some Tidal, but before the first song could play, “battery is low” message came on. I suppose I could still listen to music but that message would play every couple mins till the battery dies. So I had them for a couple years now, not sure what the expected life is for these. I would say I had a good 1.5 years listening to them everyday 1 hour to work, 1 hour back. They played perfectly throughout that time. I guess I got my money’s worth, but I just wished they still worked, I really enjoyed them. It feels like I just broke up with a girlfriend, kind of.. well onto the next!<br />BTW, the video shows how they charge now…",[],B089YRRC6V,B089YRRC6V,AHOLMKHQKWSWQQJVSOGJITW2IBKA,2023-03-20 19:35:56.765,0,True,504
235650,3,"User friendly controls, but has a major flaw or two!","Picture quality is good and I really like how easy and user friendly this dash camera is to operate. The manual is pretty well written so no complains about that.<br />BUT!!!!<br />The BIG CON is the proprietary mount which is just a sticker that sticks to the windshield and then the only movement the camera can do is up and down (not left and right). I do NOT want to have random stickers on my windshield!!!<br />So I had to go to lengths to build an adapter plate to stick to a regular sucktion cup that has a ball joint that can pivot and therefore allows the camera to swing in any direction. As most ball joints, this particular suction cup has a standard threaded stud. All dash cameras should have a STANDARD attachment, not a proprietary one.<br />However, after I had my mount built with my suction cup, the suction cup wouldn’t stick to the windshield just above my mirror because the windshield has some dots there that are the rain sensors.<br />I abandoned the suction cup idea and uninstalled my mirror, fashioned a metal bracket with holes and installed the bracket to my mirror. Then I attached a second, simpler mount with a screw to the bracket. Again, the camera can still swing up and down and now also left/right.<br /><br />Because I had to do all the work to figure out how to install the front camera without gluing a permanent sticker directly to the windshield, I lost considerable time and a few nerves too, and therefore this dash cam doesn’t deserve more than 3 stars.<br /><br />I haven’t installed the back camera yet but it too has a proprietary mount that I will have to modify.<br /><br />The second con is that not all custom settings stay preserved after I turn off the car. As an example, i can have this cam connected via Wi-Fi to an app. I don’t care about this app, so I also don’t care about having the Wi-Fi turned on in the camera. Every time I turn on the car and the cam automatically starts, it goes to the default “on” with the Wi-Fi, even though I don’t even have the app on my phone.<br /><br />In summary, a good camera if you don’t mind a sticker on your windshield and you never can move the location of the camera….","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613RB8BthPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613RB8BthPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613RB8BthPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bynCEpJsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bynCEpJsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bynCEpJsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pBWFdRrlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pBWFdRrlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pBWFdRrlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+lPWj5SeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+lPWj5SeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+lPWj5SeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lJ98XL+OL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lJ98XL+OL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lJ98XL+OL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qTr-C+rkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qTr-C+rkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qTr-C+rkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BN7VZQTC,B0BVVLKPP9,AGTQRCNUZF2MY3UESGMDPKCCPWNA,2023-01-30 03:36:35.667,0,False,504
517661,2,"great size and price, but multiple issues","I wanted a larger screen Android Auto compatible radio for my older Civic, I found a kit fascia that would fit a 9"" screen, just had to relocate the A/C heater controls. So it was a lot of working getting this radio installed, and unfortunately, I will be looking for a better one.<br />Pro's it is a large screen, and a great price, but with the multiple issues below, I will be looking for something better.<br />First issue was the amplifier would only work when the radio app(FM/AM) was on, I realized I had hooked it up to the main Blue wire (Antenna-out) instead of the Amplifier-out wire on the RCA plugs. I switched to this one, and then had no amplifier at all. Checked voltage on the Amplifier out wire, and there was none. I hard wired it into my ACC power wire to get it to work for now.<br />Next issue Android Auto, first of all it requires opening an app (Zlink), and would not ever auto load. It also will only work in wired mode, unable to get wireless to connect, phone connects fine via Bluetooth and can play music and make calls, but Zlink will not connect to go into Android Auto. Checked with my daughters iPhone, and CarPlay was the same way wired only no wireless, and still need to use Zlink, and will not autoload, even though this feature is turned on in the Zlink settings.<br />Next Issue night mode just dims the screen and doesn't put Android, or iPhone into night mode, even through phone shows black maps when connected at night you get bright white maps on the display, only the backlighting is dimmed.<br />I also know these issues are not my phone, because it works fine in my daughters car with a double din Pioneer head unit.<br />Next issue backup camera, the car is a Manual so I have no reverse signal in the car, I wired it up per the instructions, using the power feed on the video cable, but the Display never switches to the rear camera, checked camera and it is powering on, but no display change. and no way to manually show backup camera.<br />If you just want something cheap, and don't mind all the issues/work arounds to get things to work this may be for you, but I would gladly pay more to get the correct features, and options.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-YbhhtqzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-YbhhtqzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-YbhhtqzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717h6hB4QjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717h6hB4QjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717h6hB4QjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71N6GAvZfkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71N6GAvZfkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71N6GAvZfkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fLQWWduQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fLQWWduQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fLQWWduQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vHqZMR+XL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vHqZMR+XL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vHqZMR+XL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BG47458X,B0C4LDSK43,AEF2RIYA2BLWLOBVVQYTE3M6LG7A,2023-04-07 21:45:15.204,0,True,504

Lo positivo que la actualización a 13gen es impecable. Yo pasé de un 12700k a 13600kf sin problemas y de 5600mhz de ram DDR5 a 6400 mhz cl36 (2x16), lo malo que esa compatibilidad no la tienen documentada, pero me arriesgué y fue lo mejor, y el 13600kf lo tengo en 5.6/4.4 all cores estable! y uncore 49. (con buen AIO), impresionante!! (auque quizás mi proce es de los buenos en lotería de silicio). A propósito, otras de las cosas positivas que se mencionan poco, que tiene compatibilidad de cooler para diseños anteriores, como 1151, lo cuál me salvo cuando me la compré (no tuve que cambiar cooler ni comprar un adaptador). Hermoso diseño, su cantidad de puertos M2, y sin conflictos con los Sata, y 3 puertos argb. Pero otra cosa realmente negativa y es un desbalance técnico evidente, que a pesar de tener demasiados puertos para FAN (lo cúal es bueno), en la bios no puedes configurar el objetivo a ventilar de acuerdo a la temperatura monitorizada, de hecho, en ninguna parte te indican cuál es para los FAN de gabinete ¿es por temperatura cpu o motherboard?. Otro punto negativo que comparte con otras placas asus con algunas GPU rtx de gama alta (3090 en mi caso), es que tener ASPM activado genera errores en windows, por lo que hay que desactivarlo, lo cuál tampoco está documentado o se considera en la configuración optima por defecto.",[],B09J1SD9J2,B0BZJM45N3,AFELMG4BK7LL3RRFPNTLDQU6CUCQ,2023-01-11 05:50:18.032,0,False,504
153156,4,Okay budget well featured tripod. The one I got was covered in blobs of grease.,"Aoesin 71"" (180cm) Phone Tripod & Camera Stand<br /><br />Decent enough for a budget tripod, there is a lot of plastic components that seem very hard but not dense, I am not sure if they would break easier than other materials if this fell over.<br /><br />I am awarding stars based on the current price point, not compared to other better made and more expensive tripod.<br /><br />For a budget tripod this is well equipped with features and components.  However there are things that came with this that I do not know what they are for, how to attach or use them and they are not mentioned in the instructions.  I am also deducting another star because I got some sort of grease all over my clothes and hands.  All the moving plastic components at the head of the tripod were oozing big blobs of grease.  Fortunately it washed off my hands okay so I don't think it was a silicone based grease.<br /><br />I have attached a photo showing the complete instructions with the pieces that are not mentioned in those instructions.  There is some sort of hardware attachment  that seems to be missing parts to be able to do anything with.<br /><br />There are also no instructions for the shutter button but it is easy to figure out.  Turn on with the side button, scan and connect to 'AB Shutter' on your device.  I connected to my Samsung galaxy phone and the Shutter button worked for taking a photo and starting and stopping a video recording.  Both the Shutter buttons worked on my Samsung  Galaxy phone even though one is labeled IOS and the other is labeled Android, it made no difference.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review and looking at my photos of this product.

446271,5,"Terrific Headphone-Microphone for PCs, Tablets and SOME Cell Phones","I use an ANDROID cellphone and GOOGLE apps on my WINDOWS 11 PC. The newer version of WINDOWS lets you seemlessly link your phone to the PC, and I prefer to use a corded microphone/earphone combination for a sure connection on my calls.<br /><br />I liked this RAYHONTECH version due to the onboard DAC convertor. DAC stands for DIGITAL TO ANALOG CONVERTOR, which works through a USB C port  to allow you to use a headphone-microphone combo as well as headphone audio only. I currently use a SAMSUNG Galaxy A13 5G phone which is getting a bit archaic, but still does most of what I need. I have been using a combo headphone with a 3.5"" jack and a GOOGLE button on the cord. The new RAYHONTEC has the GOOGLE button PLUS a volume control, which for me was a big plus.<br /><br />On the PC it was terrific. I had immediately noticed the large and strong magnets in the headphone earpieces, and knew they would provide excellent audio range, which they did. They closely rival the quality of the wireless earbuds that I use, the microphone was flawless, and the GOOGLE switch worked great for me.<br /><br />The only problem with these was with my GALAXY A13, as the RAYHONTECH signal wasn't recognized by the A13. The AMAZON description listed the newer GALAXY phones in the A2x series only, so I while I had hoped it might work, it did not. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, as I typically link my phone to my ASUS Laptop and then can use my GALAXY phone for either calls and texts thrugh the laptop. Big plus in my mind, as I can touch type all of my texts instead of using thumbs.<br /><br />If you have a newer phone that has no 3.5'' jack, this will probably work fine on your phone, but check the model listings in the AMAZON description first, or check with RAYHONTECH. I'm going to be upgrading to newer GALAXY soon, and this excellent headphone will help me make that decision quicker.<br /><br />OVERALL: This is a terrific product at a good price.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41YGoN56tdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41YGoN56tdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41YGoN56tdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515DXlM1IJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515DXlM1IJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515DXlM1IJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BRTY4BXX,B0C597KR9K,AF2Z3UX4IB3OBUL7K7LBMSSZPZHQ,2023-01-28 22:27:19.712,0,False,504
594841,5,A Symphony of Comfort and Quality,"As an owner of the Ankbit E700s, I was eager to try out what Ankbit had to offer at the lower price point of the E500s. After trying them out, I'm truly impressed, and I highly recommend them.<br /><br />The active noise cancelling technology of the Ankbit E500 is definitely on par with the E700s. From noisy traffic to the conversations at the coffee shop, these headphones effectively eliminate low and mid-frequency distractions, allowing me to fully immerse myself in whatever I happen to be listening to.<br /><br />The sound quality is exceptional. The dual 40mm drivers deliver superior Hi-Fi audio (24-bit/96 kHz) with a well-balanced deep bass, making each listening session an absolute pleasure.<br /><br />More than just providing a hi-fi listening experience, the E500 headphones do an excellent job with clear hands-free calling. The advanced ENC technology ensures crisp, clear phone conversations without any ambient noise interference. The mute button is a nice touch, too – simply press the ANC button three times, and voilà!<br /><br />Battery life is among some of the best. With up to 75 hours of playtime in standard mode and 45 hours in wireless ANC mode (at 60% volume), I never have to worry about running out of power. Plus, a quick 10-minute charge provides an impressive 4 hours of playback, perfect for those last-minute trips.<br /><br />Comfort is high on the list as well. The ultra-soft protein leather earcups with memory foam padding, adjustable headband, and 90° rotating earcups make it easy to find the perfect fit. I can wear these headphones for hours without any discomfort.<br /><br />The wireless connection to both my phone and my computer was quick and painless. Just turn on the headphones, look for the E500 in your devices list, and pair. Bluetooth 5.2 technology ensures a stable and efficient connection with faster transmission and a wider signal range.<br /><br />The Ankbit E500 noise cancelling headphones are a fantastic investment for anyone seeking superior sound quality, comfort, and reliability. If LDAC is important to you, then consider the E700s (which recently got a firmware update). But at this price point, I think you'll be more than happy with the Ankbit E500 ANC headphones.",[],B0BZ89HS71,B0CCCXJ1JV,AHWZFM3REFTPXQZCFGLEC4LGMXDQ,2023-05-04 18:22:53.356,0,False,504
994111,5,Beast,"I've always been a fan of MSI components.  They've never let me down.  I decided to upgrade to an i9-13900K with DDR5 because I do tons of media transcoding, and this looked like a good choice to put it all together with.  I've been up and running stable for two weeks now with no issues except for one thing - the default power settings for the 13900K.  The limits for both short and long term bursts were at 4096 watts.  What??  If your AIO is hooked up to your air conditioner, then maybe.  Throttle temp was still the standard 100C.  While doing some transcoding, pretty much all of the 8 P-cores throttled out.  I saw that this is pretty much standard across the board for all mobos with the 13900.  So I set the wattage down to 200 and 140.  That kept the temps well below 100, but I noticed that now all 24 cores are working together for my transcodes.  When the wattage was set wide open, only the 8 P-cores seemed to be doing any work (and were the only cores throttling out), which is probably how it was intended.  But I don't think there is any cooler that will be able to keep that below the TJ Max.  So I'll just use all 24 cores for my work and keep things cool.  Works just fine for now.<br /><br />The board comes with XMP1 thru 3 and I'm running Corsair DDR5 at 6000 MTS with zero issues right out of the gate.  Runs a little hotter than I'm used to with DDR4, but no issues with that.  5 M2 slots for your NVME drives that all come with shields.  One of the M2 slots will take lanes from your PCIe 5.0 x16 slot, so be wary of that.  Superspeed USB ports on the I/O as well as a 2.5G ethernet port.  I don't do RGB, but there seems to be plenty of RGB customization options if that's your thing.  And of course the Z790 chipset for all your tweaks.<br /><br />Overall a very powerful board with a lot of capabilities and expansion options.  Put the power to use with an RTX3090 or 4090 and you'll have a future-proof rig for quite some time.",[],B09BYXTKC6,B09M9D6ZM2,AFD6SSEYAVQT64JC4A6UB44AUXOQ,2023-01-14 21:10:10.385,1,True,504
83902,3,How it really sounds!!!!,"First of all, let me say this: Overall, this is NOT a bad unit. It's just built for people that don't truly hear and appreciate all the bass notes in out hearing range and some outside of that, as most people don't.<br />However, I do wish 1 single person would have given an accurate description of the sound output before I waisted my time on this unit, knowing my ideal requirements. .<br />With that being said, here is my accurate description of the quality of the Bass it puts out:<br />Point Blank, there is NO LOW BASS! None at all.  Everything under 40Hz is nonexistent. I assuming its a combination of the impossibly small amount of air space in the enclosure and the subsonic filter being more overactive than they say. So R&B, Hip Hop, Techno, Anything Electronica, & Doom Metal all just have frequencies/bass that are just missing from the music.  It's like they cut it out of the song. That does not work for me.  I need to hear it as close to original as possible.<br />Now, everything from 45Hz-200Hz sounds really good, and it does lean to the higher bass notes being waaaaaaaay louder, so that kinda also bothers me, bc its not accurate to the song.<br />Also, the case does vibrate a bit on those 100Hz-150Hz notes, but its not overbearing as long as its covered or under a seat.<br />Overall, for what it is, its not bad, but it could easily be better, as I'm sure the likes of Kicker, Alpine, Cerwin Vega, Pioneer, and other higher end units may be.<br />I guess I was hoping for too much.<br />Unfortunately, my audiophile tastes do not fit the space in my Subaru Baja or I would have a 12"" or 15"" sub in a big box that does all the frequencies.<br />with that being said, I did decide to purchase an Earthquake SAS-10X shallow mount sub and I'm going to attempt to build my own underseat enclosure out of aluminum or steel that is around .5cuft.  I guess we'll see if it works to my taste.<br />Overall, if you're an audiophile or just a lover of bass, and you're stuck with small space requirements, this is not the package for you.",[],B019Z3R582,B0BXPZVKJ2,AEN6RNI6QTZYA7KCU6OVGAMXCBOQ,2023-03-14 19:44:40.713,5,True,504
488150,5,High quality dash cam video at a decent price,"[[VIDEOID:264704a7c4ded53803454782ed5c5031]] This is my second COOAU dash cam I have purchased. The other one (M53) that I purchased for our other car met my needs and has a screen on it, but I found that screen to be distracting to the other passengers in the vehicle and didn't really serve any functional purpose other than initial setup. This model (M26) does not have a screen, but does have the ability to see the camera angle on your phone using an app. It has much better video resolution at 1080P, plus a much wider angle. As you can see in the attached video, it not only covers both lanes of traffic, but off to the side to include two more lanes on each side, so six lanes total if you were on an interstate. I did the video in poor weather conditions (raining) so that you could see what it looks like in less than ideal conditions. It still took an excellent hi res video. The unit is fairly easy to install in my car, although it did take me some time to get the cord hidden in the headliner and run it back to the center console to plug in. Also included with the product is a cigarette lighter USB plug if needed. Note that you have to purchase a mini SD card like the one I have in the first pic (it was under $10 for 64G). The unit will voice prompt you to format the SD card upon initial setup. You need to download the required phone app to do so as well as to see the camera angle setup. There are two different COOAU apps in the Play Store, you want the one marked as ""Ficam"" for this product. It was easy to install and get setup. Use the wifi password ""12345678"" to initially connect the device. I like how the product has an emergency lock on the video storage in the case of a collision, protecting it and keeping it from being overwritten in the recording loop. The one drawback to this device is that it does not have a backward facing camera. You can rotate it to face backward temporarily, but it doesn't have two cameras (front and back). COOAU makes a dual camera dash cam, but it is more expensive. This one fit my needs and budget. Hopefully I never have to use the video in case of an accident, but it's there to cover me if I need it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DAFK7RdzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DAFK7RdzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DAFK7RdzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818BzMZF-mL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818BzMZF-mL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818BzMZF-mL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nq4mkhJaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nq4mkhJaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nq4mkhJaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BNSQYWZK,B0C1M5S1TB,AHMM6U5PAJIAHGFJFN5ZRUJZ2GTA,2023-02-03 13:47:58.405,4,True,504
169456,5,AMAZINGLY COMFORTABLE!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!*SEE UPDATE,"Like many others, I had issues with the OEM silicone tips that Apple provides with the AirPod Pro 2nd generation. I tried every size and although they weren’t uncomfortable, they just would not stay in my ear if I was exercising running, etc.. I decided to give these a try, and upon receiving them I was immediately impressed with the box they came in, the instructions and tips they provide and most of all the comfort of the memory foam. I used the size medium in the OEM silicone tips from Apple so that’s what size I tried first with these foam ones. They fit perfectly. I followed the instructions as it says to pinch and compress, the memory foam, insert firmly with them pointing forward, and then rotate down hold for five seconds. Within 30 seconds, I felt the foam expand in my ear. Once the foam expanded it created a tight seal that is not only more comfortable but they stayed in my ear. I’ve put them and literally tried shaking my head violently just to see if they would fall out. THEY DIDN’T FALL OUT ONCE..<br />1) I would definitely advise buying the black colored ones because the white and gray get dirty fast and they are hard to clean. The reason they get dirty so fast is because they are not silicon, they are memory foam, so any dirt or earwax or stick and discolor. 2) Follow the instructions that come with the box. It specifically says to use a cloth or a clean tissue when removing them from the box or from your AirPods. If you don’t and just use your fingers, the oils on your on your finger tips will make it difficult to remove them and you can potentially tear the foam.<br />Update: 3 months after purchasing them, I accidentally tore the foam on the size I use toe most. I used a dry cloth like I always do and I try to be as delicate as possible however, I still somehow ripped the foam. I just sent out an email to the original manufacturer to see if they will still honor the one-year warranty, even though I purchased these from Amazon. I am waiting to hear back from them and I will update again. Even if they don’t honor the one-year warranty, I would still purchase these again. The only thing I would do differently is I would buy them from the site directly to ensure I don’t void the one-year warranty.",[],B08RLTVJ9J,B0BRVTB1ZQ,AGWTVEHLCU3STAXNPHZ32XNFICIA,2023-05-09 01:51:17.115,0,False,504
408107,5,Good soundbar!,"I ordered this to use with my iPad and Laptop when in bed.<br />I was particularly enthused when I saw that there was an aux input!<br /><br />When I received the unit I was immediately impressed by the weight, as it was a touch heavier than I expected. A good feel, like something well made. Tons of wires included, and I noticed the power adapter (wall charger). While the product description clearly states this, I in my mind kept thinking batteries, but I prefer power so I am glad I can plug this in. This does not take batteries at all.<br /><br />Next I hurriedly found the aux cable,  and discovered while one end is the 1/8inch male, the other is the L and R RCA type jacks. The input on the soundbar takes the 1/8 inch end, meaning that the dual RCA plugs would need to plug into the source. So much for using it with the iPad/Laptop as those have the 1/8 inch as the output…My momentary fear was allayed when I remembered this is also BT. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to pair BT, as previous devices never paired right with my iPad. This paired in seconds and I was up and running.<br />The sound quality is nice! Great sound, no distortion, and a pretty full range. Keeping in mind that this is replacing on board iPad and Laptop speakers, the difference is night and day. Keeping things in perspective: it will not replace a proper receiver + speakers + subwoofer setup. It will not even come close to that. It’s easy to carry, use, set up, and sounds much better than onboard speakers. In fact, it exceeds what I use it for. It can easily be an upgrade to TV speakers. And when I think of all the trouble it is to set up proper audio systems in years past, I can really appreciate the simplicity presented here. Frankly, for most applications this is a good way to go.<br />If you are someone that for gaming or movies needs a bit more bass response, consider a separate reciever + sub setup, but for common use this is a great option. I love the size, that it is not 30+ inches long. This gives it a ton of flexibility. The packaging is also simple and nice, with full instructions on the box itself. Excellent quality product!",[],B0BMTN67XN,B0BMTN67XN,AH3OFLZF5Q5E4A5ZLDYX7SBJBB3A,2023-01-18 02:30:54.533,0,False,504
368404,4,I've used it twice. The first time I'd give it 3 stars. The second time 5 stars.,"I've wanted a GPS golf watch for a long time. I settled on this one for three reasons. First, two guys I regularly play with have one and both love theirs. Secondly, my golf game doesn’t require a more expensive model that provides an endless list of detailed information. Third, the watch finally came back on sale for $50 off. It seems to periodically. I’ve used it twice. Here's my reaction so far:<br /><br />Liked:<br />*  Rather than hoping that someone in my foursome will have a GPS, now I can just glance down at my wrist. So convenient.<br /><br />* I like the multiple-face display configurations. I have mine set so the numbers showing the distance to the middle of the green are extra large, which makes the number I care about easy to see, even in bright sunlight.<br /><br />*  Super comfortable. Normally, I hate wearing watches but this one is ultra-lightweight and didn’t bother me a bit.<br /><br />*  I’m no techie but downloading the app and pairing the watch to my I phone 13 was a breeze.<br /><br />*  This watch provides far more information than my golf game requires but it’s nice to know it’s there if I start getting better.<br /><br />* No complaints about battery life. I still had plenty of power left after two rounds.<br /><br />Didn’t like:<br /><br />*  On several holes during my first round, my watch had trouble finding the next hole. Even my cart-mate, who has the same watch, couldn't figure out why. His watch found every hole without any problem. That was frustrating. But during my second round (at a different course), it performed flawlessly. In fact, during that round, the golf cart had a GPS screen. I compared the distance on my watch with the cart GPS and found they were very close every time.<br /><br />* It took longer than I expected for the watch to locate and load the course, but I don’t consider that a major issue.<br /><br />* There is definitely a learning curve. I read the instructions at home but it's challenging to practice using it unless you're actually at a course with the course downloaded.",[],B08X1L2CDK,B08X1L2CDK,AH42SLLNBHXYP36VWU5CUVUW4O6Q,2023-02-18 06:12:22.992,2,True,504
15154,5,"Great quality dock with a lot of connections, extra driver software required","The UGREEN 9-in-1 docking station is a great docking station for USB C powered laptops, and want dual monitors. The docking station connections are as follows:<br /><br />~2 USB 3.0 ports<br />~1 USB-C port<br />~Dual display, both supporting HDMI or DP (up to 4K 60 hertz)<br />~Ethernet jack<br />~100W PD charging port (Charging adapter and cable not included)<br />~Host port to computer<br /><br />The dock connects to your laptop via the USB C jack and supports up to 100W charging power to your laptop. The charging cable and adapter are not included. My setup includes a MacBook Pro M1 Max. So if your laptop charges via USB C, you will not need to use your laptops native charging cable if you buy the separate adapter. This is great to keep your native charging cable in a backpack for traveling or maybe in a second location in the home. Otherwise you will still require the native charging cable.<br /><br />I am unable to speak on the 4K displays as I currently use 2 UltraWide monitors at 3440x1440. The maximum refresh rate of a display this size is 100 hertz via the Display Port.<br /><br />The UGREEN docking station is not Plug-n-Play. You need to download and install the DisplayLInk drivers in order for this dock to work. This is clearly labeled in the instructions and they provide the exact location to download it. As soon as I installed the driver on my laptop and plugged in the USB C plug, everything worked perfectly.<br /><br />The one thing I feel is missing on this docking station is headphone/microphone jacks for people who use cabled headphones or desk speakers.<br /><br />**It is normal for a dock like this to be warm to the touch after it’s in use for a bit. There are vents to help keep it cooler and prevent overheating**<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The UGREEN 9-in-1 is a great docking station for any laptop with USB C but especially for laptops that can charge with USB C. It has all of the necessary ports to setup all of your devices minus the headphone/microphone jacks.

930702,5,Great Dash Cam; Great Customer Support!,"This Dash Cam is pretty nice... the quality and clarity is super.  Overall, it performs great ""right out of the box"", so to speak.  So, yes... this is an excellent Dash Cam for my 2020 Honda CR-V.<br />The hard part of course, is the installation.  As with any dash camera, you need to develop a strategy and have a plan as to how you're going to go about setting it up.  There are a lot of YouTube videos out there on Dash Cams, so it's a good idea to view some of them.  If you decide to hardwire it, you will need to get familiar with your car's fuse box diagram; which again, you can find online.  However, that said, that was still the most challenging thing for me; finding/deciding on the right fuses to ""fuse tap"" - ACC/BATT.<br />For 2020 Honda CRV Touring owners:  I used fuse slot 19 (Moonroof) for the ACC, and fuse slot 16 (Door Lock) for the BATT.  Try to use 20 amp fuses to fuse tap with.  For hardwiring you will need a fuse tap kit - ask REDTIGER customer support for one if it didn't come with the camera (it should though).  Again, lots of YouTube videos out there to show you how.  Videos by AutoFun, ""RedTiger Hardware Kit How to Use..."" is a good one; explaining how to perform a fuse tap set up.<br />Finally, installing the cable wiring was a little less challenging as it was actually fun and rewarding.<br />I think the most important aspect of this purchase is the company - REDTIGER.  Besides standing behind their product, they really do appreciate you as a customer and are more than happy to help you - very gracious people there.  I received many follow up emails, making sure I was successful installing it.  For example, I had an issue with the rear camera's rotation; it didn't really work for my car.  So I contacted them, and they mailed me a different model (a barrel type) which better accommodated my car's hatch window.  That... by the way, was free of charge!<br />I don't recall a company who's customer support was as good as this!<br />So, great product; even better customer service.",[],B08TT1RRGP,B08TT1RRGP,AHMKBUUCOJQSE243IYWVKPHHOZFA,2023-03-02 16:50:10.107,21,True,504
338259,5,A new PC format that has advantages,"[[VIDEOID:d978c1a436aaece3b40f642ae69a8612]] I've been building PC's since 1991 and have built hundreds since then. Most have been full tower type with all the bells and whistles available at the time I built them. This KAMRUI Mini Computer, is my first opportunity to get my hands on a new type, a mini PC.<br /><br />It's about the size of a book. This KAMRUI Mini Computer, contains a quad core Intel Celeron processor, 12 gb of DDR 4 ram and a 256 gb ssd drive.  It also comes with Windows 11 pro pre installed.  These mini computers do not come with a screen, keyboard or mouse.  I already had a portable 15.6 inch screen plus a wireless keyboard and mouse and was able to have the computer booted up and ready to test in just a few minutes.<br /><br />Like any new PC, you need to go through the setup process. That takes about 10 minutes to get your account information, sign in and password ready to go.  Then you need to attach the computer to the internet. It does have a full gigabit ethernet port, but it also has some of the latest wireless connections.<br /><br />It set it up with my wireless network and it was up and running. I also started downloading all of the windows updates to the operating system. That whole process took about an hour, with all of the downloads, installs and reboots required.<br /><br />The mini pc format is not what you really want for gaming. It will work with many pc games, but the included Intel UHD graphics, while perfectly good for most uses, falls a bit short for most gaming.<br /><br />Where the format becomes very attractive is in the use this computer will be put to. I'm going to use it as my audio and video server. There are multiple server software programs that are available, and I'll have to try a few of them and see which I prefer. This mini PC is fully capable of running most of them, and it's small form factor and very quiet operation makes it ideal for that purpose.<br /><br />This mini PC comes with all of the ports you will need to hook peripherals to it. It has multiple HDMI ports, plus USB ports.

625659,1,DOA and poor design,"It was dead on arrival and I wonder if there could be more than one cause. Amazon now ships some stuff without any packaging (to save paper, more environmentally friendly?!), they just slap a label on it and ship it. So did a lack of cushioning in transit contribute to its demise? Or was it faulty to begin with? I've used plenty of external enclosures over the years, mostly Rosewill (who has stopped making them esp with fans probably because HDD going the way of CDs...?!), so this was straightforward to me to setup. I noticed the poor design with the screws that people have complained about in general in reviews.<br /><br />I took a working drive from another enclosure and put it into the Vantec. This is why the design is poor. Once you put the drive in, you have to hold the drive with one hand and then turn the enclosure over and put in the screws on the bottom with the other. That's why they enclose a screwdriver which is magnetized or the screws are magnetized because you can't use the other hand to hold the screws. The workaround to this is to set the drive down on top of the outside of the enclosure so the drive rests on it to keep it in place so you can use two hands to put in the screws. The screws go in the bottom instead of on the sides like Rosewill enclosures and if it falls out it gets lost in the enclosure and you have to shake it out. This is ridiculous! Anyway I got the screws in and connected the enclosure to power and USB. Flipped the power switch. Initially the blue light came on but after a number of tries to get the thing to work it stopped lighting up. The drive failed to spin up or be recognized. I tried turning on the fan with the dial switch and nothing happened. I tried a number of things to troubleshoot to get the enclosure to work but it did not. Drive was never recognized, fan never turned on, blue light stopped working. Compared to the old Rosewill's this thing is a piece of junk! But if you get a working one and it works for you then congratulations!<br /><br />I returned it and don't want another one. In fact I'm not ordering a different one from Amazon nor any type of electronic device which could potentially ship without packaging (and get damaged in transit) again.

481536,5,Sony vs. Airpods,"I'm not an audiophile, but I was looking for great sound, noise cancellation, and fit. I got the Airpods first, but was a little disappointed with the sound quality so I got the Sony's since I love the sound on my WH-1000XM4 headphones.<br /><br />Sound-I bought the Sony's (WF-1000XM4) second for one main reason, SOUND! I have the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones which are amazing. The Sony earbuds sound very close to the headphones. The Airpods didn't quite have the same sound although they sound great. I was actually surprised that the Airpods sounded very close to a pair of Mpow M30 earbuds that I got in 2020 for $30. The Sony's seem a bit louder with richer sound. Also, the Sony buds have the ability to change the sound profile using the equalizer app. The Airpods rank second to Sony in my opinion.<br /><br />Noise cancellation- Both Sony and Airpods do an amazing job, but I think the Airpods beat out the Sony but a hair. The noise cancellation does not disappoint on either one.<br /><br />Fit- The Airpods are way more comfortable for my small ears. The Sony feel big and like they are going to pop out. I find both comfortable, but the Airpods feel more natural in my ears. The Sony's take a little getting use to.<br /><br />Controls- I prefer the Sony controls. The Airpod controls still feel a little awkward to me. Matter of preference.<br /><br />Voice/Calls- LOVE the Airpods!!! I haven't tried the Sony's on calls yet simply because I automatically go for my Airpods. They connect quicker. The calls are clean like the person is in the room with you.<br /><br />Battery Life- Airpods lasted a bit longer.<br /><br />Overall, if you mainly make calls or workout, I would go with the Airpods. If you are looking more for music listening, then the Sony's are way better. Noise cancellation...either one, but because of the better fit of the Airpods on small ears, I would default to the Airpods...although the Sony headphones beat out both.

329846,2,Test Immediately to Avoid Flickering + Dual Controller Problems,"I've had this monitor for over six months now. I wish I tested everything immediately because Amazon only allows 30 days to return it.<br /><br />I bought this monitor to run two laptops with one monitor, one mouse, one keyboard, and connect my accessories to the monitor (i.e. webcam). It doesn't offer that. The Ergo stand however is fantastic and well worth the cost, just wish it was compatible with monitors of other brands so this isn't a complete dud. Monitor has compatibility issues, flickering/power disbursement issues, and KVM/Dual Controller issues.<br /><br />LG won't refund the monitor until you send it in 3 times. Nightmare going back and forth on this.<br /><br />Flickering:<br />I had this issue and it was infuriating to the point that I got a new laptop. Turns out you can't maximize the ports on the monitor because the monitor doesn't diffuse power to connected devices in a smart way (i.e. your other connected devices are getting more energy than your laptop). Basically the reps said you need to connect your accessories to the laptop instead of the monitor, which defeats the purpose imo.<br /><br />Among my two laptops, the X1 suffered endless flickering issues but the Dell XPS didn't. The Dell did experience flickering when viewing certain applications though. I ended up resolving the Dell's issue by switching to a different browser. The X1 is still hopeless. Both run i7 and are in excellent condition, so it's a loss on why the X1 isn't compatible.<br /><br />Dual Controller:<br />I've sent in the monitor for repair and it still has the same issue. First they said to connect the laptop with USB-C and HDMI, but now it's DP and HDMI. Still doesn't work, and by using DP, I can't charge the main laptop with Thunderbolt PD. This makes this monitor a nightmare and obsolete. Recommend getting a different monitor capable of delivering as promised.<br /><br />The repair process was fairly simple but required more than 1 hour on the phone with a rep, waiting for a return box to arrive, then shipping the monitor within a month. But, the box I received didn't meet their shipping specifications and I had to bring the monitor into FedEx to have them pack and ship it.

It has all the functions I needed. The sleep tracker is on point, heart rate and steps records are correct. I was pleasantly surprised that it has the function to remote snap photos when connected to my andriod phone and shows accurate weather (added bonuses, if you ask me). The watch is little weight compared to my former fitness watch (which had NO weight whatsoever and has limited functions) - this watch makes for a good investment. I still have more testing to do and want to make some comparisons with my daughter's apple watch. So I'll be back to update this review.  Personally, I LOVE the watch. ❤ I'm very happy with it. 🥰<br /><br />2/26 -update: So I made comparisons in the past several weeks with the apple watch. Here is what i found.....the functionality is similar or same to the apple watch with accurate tracking workouts and health biometrics, which is superb! It tracks the steps, calories burned, distance walked and tracks the beats per minute for your heart rate. It shows weather, date, time and day of the week.  Most important the battery (on a 2 hour charge or less), lasted close to 14 days!!! Something I never got with the fitbit watch. The watch plays music (tap the music icon on the watch, press play on the phone and the music plays thru the watch) and capture photos when connected to Bluetooth (when you open the camera icon it becomes a shutter button-tap on it and the camera on your cell snaps the photo).<br /><br />The watch has a dial pad to make calls as well as pull up your list of contacts, it receives calls. Yes, you can answer the call and talk through the watch! As for texting, the watch certainly receives the messages but DOES NOT have the functionality to send texts. ☹️ hopefully, they developers can add it later on. (Quick note: Make sure you read the booklet that comes with the watch. It helps with step-by-step instructions on how it set up).<br /><br />Overall, since the purchase of this watch, I have been extremely happy with it.

979775,5,Great external build quality and it fills a niche that typical outlet strips miss.,"This is a very solid unit and it takes only a modest amount of common sense to avoid tipping it over.  It's larger than it appears (to me) in Amazon's photos, but I'm sure that you could tip it over if you hang a bunch of heavy cords and wall warts all on one side.  That's why most competing products include bases that are larger than the towers themselves.<br /><br />The surge suppression may actually be useful because there is an indicator light to show that it is (allegedly) still functional.  That's a big problem with many surge suppressing outlet strips -- the MOVs wear out after taking some number of surges and there is no indication that the surge suppression no longer works.  The bad thing is that the light is on the back corner just above the power cord, where it's likely to go for months before someone notices that it's off (if they ever do).  It should be on the front corner with the USB ports.<br /><br />The USB charging ports on mine are likely to see use charging flashlights, Kindles, and other modest cost devices.  I'm not a big fan of plugging expensive smartphones and high-end tablets into power strip USB ports.  If my in-warranty iPhone is fried by a failed, in-warranty Apple power adapter, Apple owes me a new phone.  If it's fried by a failed circuit inside of some off-brand, Chinese power strip, I'm probably out of luck.<br /><br />All in all, this is a quality product that deserves the price charged.<br /><br />Note:  My evaluation is based on physically examining and using the unit and on the published specifications.  I have not disassembled the unit to evaluate the electrical engineering, internal workmanship, or parts quality.  Nor have I subjected it to stress-testing of any kind.<br />__________<br /><br />Note:  Complaints about the type size of the manual seem rather silly.

609936,4,"Good headphones, perfect fit, worth the price.","To preface, I've tried several inexpensive True Wireless buds from Amazon. Most ranging from $20 - $40. My general issue with them is either:<br />A) They sound horrible<br />B) They don't fit well while running<br />C) They break or stop connecting<br /><br />So far, these Earfun buds have leave all those boxes unchecked - which is great!<br /><br />They sound good. I wouldn't say they sound GREAT, but they sound good. The Tozo T10s sound better in my opinion, but these do have a balanced soundscape that doesn't hide behind too much Bass like other inexpensive buds.<br />The noise reduction is OK. Honestly it's hard to tell when it's on or off - there's very little difference. You also need the left earbud in to activate/deactivate, since the toggle requires to hold the left bud for 2 seconds.<br />The fit is PERFECT. These fit better than any other buds I've worn. I run 25-35 miles per week and one issue I've found is a lot of buds fall out too easily (which is the downfall of the Tozo T10s), stick out too much so that it's uncomfortable to wear anything over your ears like a headband/sock hat, or they have a hook that causes some excess noise or flopping. These latched into my ear perfectly out-of-the-box and sit flush with my outer ear, so I can wear something over the top without it interfering. Definitely the best fit I've had with buds.<br />Battery life is fine. I don't really need a million hours of battery. I charge the case about once a week and that's good. The buds themselves I use for no more than 3 hours at a time and they've never gone below 50%.<br />The case is TINY! Again, I've used lots of buds and have never seen such a tiny case for them. It's like a roll of Rolaids. I love that it fits so much easier in my pocket.<br /><br />All in all, I give it 4*. The sound quality is above average but I've heard better on cheaper buds, and the noise cancelling isn't very noticeable. Other than that, these are incredible buds and are worth the slight premium over other ""budget"" true wireless buds.",[],B09JWMJ7PW,B09JWMJ7PW,AEJZU5HRQEHTGXEVW5EF7KRT5MLA,2023-01-29 18:33:50.919,2,True,504
602611,5,I was sick of un/re-plugging HDMI cords every time I wanted to play my switch. Problem solved!,"I can’t believe I didn’t know these things existed…but now that I do….they’ve made dealing with our projector SO much easier!🥰<br /><br />We don’t have a TV at the moment. That said, using a projector is just fine— most of the time.<br />The biggest downside to using a projector as your entertainment center -VS.- a T.V.? There’s only ONE HDMI port on the projector.<br /><br />Until I ordered this HDMI 3 In 1 Out HDMI Switch, every time I wanted to use my Roku instead of my Firestick…I’d need to:<br />1. Unplug the power source to my Firestick.<br />2. Disconnect Firestick from the *one* HDMI port on my projector.<br />3. Connect my Roku to a power source.<br />4. Plug one end of the HDMI cord into the Roku.<br />5. Plug the opposing end of the HDMI cord into the projector’s single HDMI port.<br /><br />That is just ONE example of a scenario where I’d need to fiddle with all of those cords in order to simply watch what I want to watch.😐<br /><br />With this device? I’m able to keep my Roku, Firestick, *AND* my Nintendo Switch’s HDMI cord ALL PLUGGED INTO THAT 1 HDMI PORT!🙌🏻😍<br />• It’s super quick & easy to switch back and forth from one input to another, using the IR remote.<br />• Plugging the HDMI switch to a power source (using the provided Micro-USB cable*) is totally optional…which I LOVE because I HATE dealing with additional power cords! It may have a short delay (3-5 seconds after pressing your desired input button)…but just give it a moment. It will switch inputs!<br /><br />It’s working perfectly so far.

938336,4,Broken Foot but cool keyBOARD.  Pay no attention to the mouse.,"The flip out feet on the back are junk and will break on you.  The design was poor and left the hinge of the feet fragile and thin.  I never use the flip down feet. But I do always put the keyboard back in the box when I'm not using it and the other day I pulled the keyboard out and the foot had broken off inside the box. See Picture.  I liked the keyboard. The light up keys also has a heart beat pulsing setting you can use...which is creepy.  It has 3 things that other keyboards don't have.  Illuminated key, oversize jumbo keys, without being uncomfortable for people with small hands who do like to touch type.  Most of the time keyboards that stray from the normal standard size that people are used to...tend to create a mess of mistakes when you go to use them.  Either the keys are too big and too far apart and your fingers miss key strokes, or they are too small and you end up hitting 2 keys at the same time when touch typing.  YES, it's wired.  Otherwise it wouldn't be able to illuminate for long.  I ordered it because I love to type in the dark and I really wanted a keyboard that I could quickly find the delete key or backspace key without having to place both hands on the keyboard and feeling for the F and J keys.  I wanted a keyboard that created an ambience in the room, so I wouldn't have to burn so many candles or keep a little flashlight near me to find that illusive thing on the nightstand.  So, I kinda wanted a nightlight that doubled as a device that I'm using.  This was it.  The wired, optical, boring, nothing to right home to mom and dad about, MOUSE.  Is really just thrown into the deal to make you feel like you're getting a pair of socks.  Honestly, if I was the seller.  I wouldn't even box the keyboard and mouse together.  They are WASTING THEIR MONEY.  Nobody gives a crap about a boring mouse, it doesn't light up, it's really a junk prize.  They should just sell the keyboard by itself and use the money they would save giving away junk mice, to further improve the keyboards design.  Oh and it the keyboard has two little feet.  It's made and put together just like the old compact keyboards from high school.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714uqSoUV6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714uqSoUV6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714uqSoUV6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81FrsuvRJvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81FrsuvRJvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81FrsuvRJvL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IrlgUoHLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IrlgUoHLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IrlgUoHLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BHWK88JD,B0BHWK88JD,AGD4VAY7WWAMIOSOLYVQ22PZIHRA,2023-01-06 05:54:06.569,3,False,503
815994,3,"Not ideal for Mac Mini, probably fine for Windows","I just got a new Mac Mini M2 and I needed to get a monitor for it.  I really like curved monitors (even though there don't seem to be many of them made) and I wanted to get a 27"" monitor, so this one seemed to fit the bill for my budget.  It's not a 4k monitor, but I'm coming from a 2013 iMac, so I figured the screen has got to be better than my decade old iMac right?  Wrong.  The first thing I noticed was that all the text on the screen was a little blurry.  It wasn't unreadable, but I definitely had to focus my eyes a bit more to be able to read it.  Some of icons had a bit of ""fuzziness"" in their appearance as well.  I never had this issue on my old iMac and this was driving me nuts.<br /><br />I did some research into the issue and the bottom line is, you will never get anything close to what you see on an iMac unless you buy an Apple monitor, which is insanely expensive.  Apple's monitors have almost quadruple the pixels (typically 5K or 6K monitors) and then they downscale the resolution so everything doesn't appear tiny.  With a 2K monitor, it just doesn't have enough pixel density to display everything clearly.  I did find out that Apple has enabled font smoothing by default because they assume you will be using a retina display.  You can turn this off at the command line (or through your Settings if using an older version of MacOS).  It did help to reduce the blurriness of text for me, but now the text appeared jagged.  From everything I read, the best compromise is to get a 4K monitor to get greater pixel density.  It still won't be perfect (definitely not like what you'll see on a Apple retina monitor), but at least it will be a step up.  I actually sent this one back to Amazon and I'm now hunting around for a 4K monitor.  I think I'm going to go with the Samsung S80A or Dell S2721QS.<br /><br />If you use Windows, this monitor would probably be perfectly fine to use.  With Apple's combination of using high-end monitors and then downscaling the resolution, it can be really hard to make this look perfect on Apple computers.",[],B087N3JPLF,B0BVGCLRVM,AHE5KBXT4BXZMIECQFX635S5EJIQ,2023-02-20 15:43:31.730,6,True,503
834245,4,"Awesome, retro looking player with nice source options","[[VIDEOID:3f072fc7493cacfc69d229e3b98b6206]] Here's what I love about the CYBORIS Retro Bluetooth Speaker.<br />- The look.  Sweet looking retro radio.  The guys at work are jealous.<br />- The size.  Not too small, but nice and compact.  Lightweight too.<br />- The ""feet"".  Sort of rubber and grip to surfaces nicely.<br />- Input options.  Micro SD card comes in so handy for all those mp3 files I have stored up over the years.  USB, and of course Bluetooth.  All work well.<br />- The light show!  Pretty cool, changing colors, flash to the beat. Importantly, this can be turned off as well.  Fun show tho!<br />- Radio & Radio dial.  Very nice extra option to pick up radio stations.  The dial fits the style so well.<br />- Button feedback.  Makes an acknowledgement noise when you operate it.<br />- Easy to use.  Not too many features so there are a total of 5 buttons on this unit.  Long press and short press make up the manipulation of settings/options.  Although, some things seem to be missing....See below<br /><br />Things I'm not as fond of:<br />- I can't seem to find a way to randomize SD/USB play.  Need to research. But it's no fun hearing the same playlist when the card holds so many songs. You always get the first several then I've moved on.  So for now I press Fast Forward, which is a long press. Slow and inefficient.<br />- Speaker quality.  Now granted, this is a small and lightweight device.  The sound is about what you'd expect.  Not terrible, but not impressive either.<br />- Battery life is fair.  Not terrible, not great.  I think I got about 6-8 hours out of it on average.<br />- Seems to be FM radio only.  Not a big deal to me.<br /><br />Lots of options out there for bluetooth speakers.  I like the look and size of this one.  That retro look makes it stand out.

165222,5,Love it!! Who knew you could be so happy over a keyboard,"I immediately love it!! I only just opened it minutes ago and and seriously loving everything. The keyboard is super light weight, sleek, and has a slight bump out underneath creating a tilt (perfect for me). The color is beautiful, I was worried it would be an off-putting color but it's great. There's an on/off power switch which could be helpful for some. The instructions do say it goes to sleep after 10mins, so I may not need it.<br />I was a little worried about the thinness mouse, but it contours to the hand nicely. I'd say I have a large hand (gloves I wear are men's large/women's XL if that helps). It slides nicely across all surfaces so far with no lag in play.<br />The setup is basically non existent.. in that you just plug the USB receiver in & immediately go to work! No downloading of anything, no driver setups, no settings to adjust (other than mouse speed preferences). I even swapped from the Surface to LG gram mid stream with no issues, no hiccups, zero lag.<br />The keyboard cover is pretty nice. I really didn't have any expectations other than hoping they've come a long way from the DOS computer days (a given). It's very thin and fairly opaque. You can tell it's on the keyboard by looking but slightly. Thickness doesn't play a factor in hindering feel for the keys at all either. I will say fuzz and hair do stick it really fast & strongly and for me the effort to which you have to put in to pick the things off is slightly annoying, you can't just blow them off. Mine did come with a very slight tear, I only noticed it when I running my palm across the top. It doesn't seem that it would tear easily, from the little bit I was checking it out. I'm not going to mess with it or test it too much just in case. I'm not sure if it's the material or me just not being used to a cover, but so far my fingers don't slide across the keys as easily (or as I'm used to). Seems to be a silicone type material, I'm sure it says somewhere I just haven't looked.<br />The first set of pictures are without the cover, and then with the cover to see the difference. Either way I absolutely love it!

21620,5,Great Keyboard!,"I've used laptops as my primary pc for years. I recently switched to an all in one that came with a standard wireless desktop keyboard. I was beginning to think it was an expensive mistake because I simply could not get comfortable using the keyboard or the mouse. I was forever trying to trace my finger around and click on my desk since I haven't used a mouse in probably 20 years or more. I tried a track pad. The function was great, the placement was not intuitive or comfortable which led to more tracing and clicking on my desk. The search was on for a keyboard with a familiar, non-compact layout with a reasonably sized touch pad with the least amount of notably aggravating features. This keyboard hit all the marks. The only minor caveat is it goes dormant if not in used for a period of minutes. I don't really mind as it's not hard to wake up and it since it is rechargeable, backlit wireless it ultimately saves battery. Something I didn't realize until this keyboard arrived was how much I hate the height of the keys and the tactile feel of a standard desktop keyboard. This keyboard has the pleasant, solid and springy feel of a laptop keyboard. Not the clumsy and clackity noise of a desktop keyboard. While the touchpad is to the right rather than below the keys, it's easy and comfortable to use. I was able to change settings to allow more functionality through the pad itself instead of having to use the buttons for so much. I can change the colors on the keyboard as well as the backlight intensity. The lighting can also be turned off to save battery. I'm kind of enjoying low light purple so I'll deal with having to plug it in every other day or so. I knew I would miss having a number pad but realized it would not be as awkward to reach for that as a touchpad. So I also purchased a generic (labeled Jelly Comb) wireless keypad. It also has the same brightness and color selections to match the keyboard. I've been running the same low light purple on it for a week and no need to charge yet. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B87G8P34/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  These two items turned what I thought was going to be a keyboarding nightmare back into a pleasant user experience.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719622+ji8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719622+ji8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719622+ji8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09KLPJQPD,B09KLPJQPD,AH6GSSLBHTF6FJEGOUC3DGHYG5KA,2023-02-20 13:36:36.076,0,True,503
209226,3,"A Somewhat Slow, but Working RAM Kit","This is an okay deal for RAM if you really need something in a pinch if you don't care about heatsinks or RGB lighting on your DIMMs. These arrive in a plain-barebones OEM-style configuration, without any temperature protection for the memory modules as well as there being no RGB or cool looking heat spreader to spice up your PC aesthetics. However, if you just need a basic RAM kit for troubleshooting purposes or as a backup, this works well enough.<br /><br />My RAM did arrive in a clunky package, so my DIMMs were already loose inside the box when I took it out. Luckily, they did work, but the packaging does not inspire confidence. The RAM sticks were able to be installed like any other RAM, and my computer was able to boot. By default, this kit still settles for the non-XMP speed profiles, so you do have to make some BIOS adjustments to take advantage of this ""measly"" speed increase if you want to get the most out of it.<br /><br />While the RAM did function, and I didn't have any crashes or weird issues overall, I did notice quite a steep performance drop when compared to the 3200Mhz Corsair Vengeance RAM that I had been using for my main setup. Games were more stutter-y, and my frame times were way less consistent compared to the Corsair DIMMs. I dropped an average of 6-14 FPS in some games just for the slight difference, but I don't know if that's just because the speed is lower or due to the unusually high CAS latency on these sticks. I don't know, but you will see a performance decrease compared to faster DIMMs.<br /><br />For my use case though, I mostly wanted these as a troubleshooting kit as I don't care how good the RAM is if I just need to figure out an issue with my PC, and I am confident enough that this will help me troubleshoot faulty RAM should I ever have the need.<br /><br />Overall, there are a few issues that I have that prevent me from rating it higher. While the RAM does function, it comes with a much slower speed, lack of adequate shipping protection, no heat spreader, and a higher CAS latency when Corsair Vengeance RAM is much more reliable for only a few extra coins. I would recommend it as a backup or troubleshooting kit but not for daily use.",[],B0BNKZ4LBM,B0CFYS6H6P,AF7SO6JG76JZKBKRBXAVQJOJBPHQ,2023-01-14 06:40:16.091,0,False,503
11207,5,Fast.  Great TBW. Simple. Super boot times.,"I have bought this multiple times and when the need arises another will be gotten.  Sure some have faster R/W times, but using this on a Ryzen 9  I see no lag, no negative whatsoever. I do not game, but I edit photos and video, create html and php pages, crunch numbers in spreadsheets,  do web things, etc - this drive is faster than it needs to be  - well almost, but it never seems to be the bottleneck as drives historically have been.  When I remember RLL and  MFM or even PATA  - this outpaces to a great degree. The boot times for this vs using NVME is truly not noticeable.  I cannot tell if the drive boots in three seconds or four and besides during some boots various behind the scenes activities occur that do not happen other boot times.  The manufacturer says four times faster than a  HDD.  I think even more in practice as I had a 2.5"" platter drive where this was to test that and the boot times were an eternity, the OS was slow and pokey and it got replaced with this wonderful SSD.<br /><br />One special reason I use these , and buy the 2 TB size is the longevity. The TBW is wonderful. The company states:<br />512GB Read/Write: up to 530/470 MB/s , 400TBW<br />1TB Read/Write: up to 540/490 MB/s , 800TBW<br />2TB Read/Write: up to 540/490 MB/s , 1,600TBW<br />so the large drive has exponentially more life than the smaller one.  That said I do have a 512 that is my oldest purchase and it is still working fine and has no SMART error, it is in good health.<br /><br />Two of the 2T are booting Windows 11 that is about 256 GB with about 750GB drive D: and then the remaining 1 TB is an ext4 partition for Debian to use.  This lets me share Windows created content on the 750 GB very easy and this scheme works well in my workflow.  Linux boots on its own NVME drive. This SSD mounted well as size is exact to the standard with threads facing down and out the side for versatility.<br /><br />Packaging is simple:  A SSD in a clear plastic tray in a small cardboard box.

594845,5,A Full Suite of Content Creation Tools in One Package,"As a content creator, I'm always on the lookout for new gear that can help me produce better quality videos. Recently, I tried out the Movo tablet vlogging kit, and I'm happy to share my thoughts on this all-in-one creator package.<br /><br />First off, I was impressed by the full-size tripod included in the kit. It's made of lightweight yet durable aluminum, making it easy to carry around without compromising stability. The tripod expands up to 57"" tall, giving me a wide range of shooting angles and options. The pan head is smooth, allowing for precise adjustments during filming. I also appreciate the built-in bubble level, which helps me ensure that my shots are perfectly framed and level.<br /><br />The tablet tripod mount is another standout feature of the Movo kit. It has a sturdy design that keeps my iPad secure and stable during filming. The screw-tight locking mechanism is reliable, and the holder expands to fit a range of tablet sizes. I no longer have to worry about my tablet wobbling or falling during my shoots, which is a huge relief.<br /><br />When it comes to lighting, the Movo kit has includes an ultra-bright compact LED light. It offers a combination of warm and cool LEDs, allowing me to easily adjust the color temperature to suit my filming environment. The three brightness settings give me the flexibility to control the intensity of the light, which is essential for achieving professional-looking videos.<br /><br />The cardioid condenser shotgun video microphone included in the kit is great for capturing high-quality audio. It significantly improves the audio quality of my videos, as it's designed to pick up sounds directly in front of the microphone while minimizing background noise. This has helped me create clear and crisp audio that matches the quality of my visuals.<br /><br />One thing to note is that a Lightning or USB-C dongle is not included in the kit. This wasn't a big issue for me, as I already had one, but it's something to be aware of when purchasing this kit.<br /><br />Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Movo tablet vlogging kit. It has elevated my content creation game, providing me with professional-grade tools in a convenient and easy-to-use package. If you're just beginning to create content, this is a great way to get a complete set of tools.",[],B0BQLMHQS4,B0BQLMHQS4,AHWZFM3REFTPXQZCFGLEC4LGMXDQ,2023-04-27 15:41:15.947,0,False,503
818968,5,Expensive but Powerful,"My experience is coming from a 2070 to the 4070ti. In summery, I'm very happy with this GPU even if it cost a lot. For me, this is an investment into many years of high quality gaming which is my favorite hobby and what I spend much of my free time doing. I've listed my pros and cons for the GPU below with cons first.<br /><br />Cons<br />-Price. This GPU is expensive even if it is less expensive than other 4070ti's and would be of better value at a $700 price point. Maybe wait for it to go on sale or get a used one if you can wait. If you have to get a 4070ti on Amazon right now, this is the best value one I could find.<br />-Massive Size. For some people, this is a pro. But for those of you with smaller cases or cases full of hard drive bays, this GPU will be too big. It's at least twice as thick as my previous RTX 2070 and 3 inches longer. MAKE SURE YOU RESEARCH WHAT SIZE YOU CAN ACCOMODATE. It fits my NZXT H510 just fine with a bout an 1.5 inches of spare room.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Runs all my games at 1440p max settings @ 60fps+ with no problem. It often reaches frame rates in the hundreds no problem.<br />-Runs most games at 4K max settings @ 60fps. (Exceptions include modern titles with horrible optimization.)<br />-Runs very cool with temps no higher than 60° C but often runs in the high 40's while gaming. It idles in the low 30's.<br />-Low wattage requirement. A 750 watt Power Supply and 2 8-pin connectors is all you need. There is a converter for the 8-pin connectors that comes with this GPU.<br />-Quiet. The fans that come with the cooler aren't loud and the don't hit high RPM's because the GPU runs so cool.<br />-Overclockable. I haven't experimented with this yet, but this card does allow overclocking.<br />-Build Quality. This GPU is built like a tank with a metal back plate, and it doesn't sag in the PCIe slot and doesn't require a bracket.<br />-RGB customization through PNY's VelocityX Verto Software","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-dr5onI8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-dr5onI8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-dr5onI8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71d3+xQPMuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71d3+xQPMuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71d3+xQPMuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BRKR14S1,B0BTHJVF1R,AER2BEWDLHFOCSIZKQSLWJKJQEPA,2023-02-06 03:39:38.151,23,True,503

535283,5,Important!  (The 1/16 update tells you how to set computer to use 802.11ac),"I bought this computer for my roommate on Black Friday so it was a great deal. I've read most of the reviews for it here on Amazon so I had some expectations about how it would work.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that 4gb of ram is probably going to be sufficient for the tasks that she is going to be doing. No resource demanding programs will be used. Though you can easily add an 8gb stick of ram for 12gb total.<br /><br />The wifi card was said to be slow by 2 different reviewers here and using the computer myself for a couple hours indicated that it's speed was fine. The computer downloaded and installed updates quickly and browsing the internet was satisfying. It worked similarly to my Acer Aspire 5 which I am very pleased with.<br /><br />I credit the nvme SSD with making the performance snappy with this computer. And you can easily upgrade the SSD to a larger capacity if you want. There is also an empty bay for a 2.5 inch sata SSD but you need to purchase a cable and mounting bracket for it.<br /><br />Overall a decent computer for many people who don't need a high powered machine. Recommended.<br /><br />Note: I just updated it to 22H2 and the Disk Cleanup utility has been moved. The only way I can find it is with the search box on the task bar. (I have since found it in Start>All Apps>Windows Tools.)<br /><br />Update 1/13 - I've spent even more time with this machine and I will say it rivals my Acer Aspire 5 which is saying something. At the current price of $245 from Amazon it is over $110 cheaper than the Acer Aspire 5 so it is a best buy in my opinion. The Asus VivoBook 14 is a great computer.<br /><br />Update 1/16 - I discovered why people are getting low wifi speeds using Ookla Speedtest. The computer comes set to only utilize 802.11n rather than 802.11ac that it is capable of. Go to Device Manager, Network Adapters and double click on Realtec Wireless LAN. On the advanced tab Wireless Mode set to 802.11a/n/ac. Then Task Manager shows that 802.11ac is being used.

92421,5,"Amazing sound, perfect for specific use cases","Over the years I have built up a collection of headphones from the likes of Sennheiser, Bose, Koss, Parrot, Philips, Apple, and Sony.  I've been aware of Grado headphones for a while, but this is the first pair I've owned.  These have quickly become one of my favorites, but they are best for specific use cases.<br /><br />If you are going to use headphones in a noisy environment, in close proximity (i.e. within 6 ft) of another person who would be disturbed by sound leakage, or while exercising, these are not the headphones you want.  They do not have noise cancellation and are open back, meaning sound leaks both in and out.<br /><br />They are a larger on-ear, rather than over-ear, design.  The clamping force is not too strong, but can get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours, especially for glasses wearers.  They support Bluetooth 5.2 and the latest AAC/AptX codecs so the sound quality is the best available over Bluetooth.  The open-back design and the efficient 44mm drivers provide a truly wonderful soundstage for a wide variety of music.  Compared to most closed-back noise canceling headphones these sound like someone turned on spatial audio -- voices and instruments are clearly distinguishable, almost directional.  The mids are clearly defined, revealing details that are muddy in other headphones.  The highs sparkle, but are never harsh or sibilant.  The bass is quite good for an open-back design, but it's a controlled rumble rather than a rattling thump.  They play loud without need to crank the volume up and the sound is less processed and fatiguing than many of my other headphones.  I'm not aware of any other open-back, wireless headphones on the market.<br /><br />The batteries last forever, USB-C charging is fast, and the physical buttons work exactly as you'd expect.  The plastic-y construction and light weight mean these definitely don't have the high quality feel you'd like at this price point.  They don't even come with a case.<br /><br />But if you are willing to pay up for sound quality and can handle all the other limitations, these are great headphones with nothing else quite like them out there.  However, I would not recommend them as your only pair.",[],B0BM6NCMFH,B0BM6NCMFH,AHMLA7XUIVTYYQK5COSEV6P6RLKA,2023-05-16 17:32:41.158,2,True,503
442625,3,"Mouse feels great, the keyboard not so much","UPDATE: After about a week of use, I'm noticing that the keyboard is giving me some input problems.  I sometimes have to press a key a few times for it to register.  It doesn't happen all the time, but it is something I'm beginning to notice.  I'm unable to determine if this is a connection issue or if it's an issue with the contacts beneath it's keys, but an issue nonetheless. I still enjoy using the mouse.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Let me start by saying I love the feel of the mouse.  It has very soft buttons and do not make a loud ""click"" noise as with some other ones.  Glides well across my desk and has the dpi button.  The mouse takes 1 AA battery, but does not have a compartment for the usb adapter as I've seen on other models. Too soon to talk about battery life, but overall the mouse feels really good, IMHO.  The keyboard works great, but didn't immediately connect to the included adapter.  The keyboard takes 1 AAA battery.  I had to read a little deeper into the instruction to notice that you have to press ""ESC"" and ""+="" for a few seconds to wake up the keyboard in order for it to connect.  At the beginning of the instruction booklet it said it would automatically connect.  Not a big deal, but not clear either.  Once connected it has been fine and reconnects every time.  I'm using the keyboard to write this review.  The keyboard keys feel good and sounds as a normal keyboard.  On the back it has two legs that you flip open to give a more ergonomic position for typing.  I just think that the keyboard feels a little cheap, especially compared to the mouse.  It has a very light, plasticky feel. Nothing major, but worth mentioning.  Also, I was a little disappointed as I misread the title for this keyboard/mouse combo and read ""blacklist"" as ""backlit"" and thought I was getting a backlit keyboard.  My mistake LOL, but just mentioning it here so others might avoid the same mistake.  This is NOT backlit. I think the price is ok for what this is, again the mouse feels better compared to the keyboard, but that's just my opinion.  If the price looks right to you then it's worth a look because it does work.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NI6b+YPPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NI6b+YPPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NI6b+YPPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B5TDL71V,B0B5TDL71V,AE26II5GFCWAL3KIALKSWJWMT3AA,2023-01-23 03:24:47.825,0,False,503
738388,4,Supports Samsung Fast (but not Super Fast) Charging,"In order to charge my phone in my neoprene phone pouch (sized to fit both my Samsung Galaxy 22+ phone and my Anker Powercore Slim 10000 PD) I wanted to have a cable that would support the Samsung Fast Charging (but not Super Fast Charging) that this external battery supports.<br />Eventually some company will make a similar, phone-size/phone-shape slim charger that supports Samsung Super Fast Charging, but we're not there yet.<br />So as to fit neatly in the phone pouch, I wanted a cable with right-angle USB-C male plugs on both ends.<br />I found three here on amazon, but couldn't figured which would be best. So I ordered all three to do some camparison testing to report for all three cables.<br />Here are the three I bought, with my analysis of each.<br />zdyCGTTime: The cable is short (~20 cm/7"" between the centers of the two plugs). The cable itself is thick and stiff and doesn't bend well. When plugged into a wall charger that supports Samsung Super Fast Charging, the cable also supports it. However, I found that the USB-C male plug would lose the connection with my phone when it was jiggled so I discarded this as an option.<br />AAOTOKK: this superficially looks similar to the zdyCGTTime cable, but longer (~32 cm/12.5"" between the centers of the two plugs). Like the zdyCGTTime, the cable is thick and stiff and supports Super Fast Charging. Unlike that zdyCGTTime, the plug fits securely in the phone's USB-C socket and no amount of wiggling causes it to lose contact. It supports Samsung Super Fast Charging, and even if the longer cable is heavier and bulkier, the length allows it to lie next to the phone/external battery so fits better into the pouch. If my external battery supported Super Fast Charging this would be my choice.<br />KOOWOD: like the AAOTOKK, this cable is longer, but the cable is thinner, lighter and much more flexible, bends easily and sits happily in my phone pouch next to my phone and external batter. It does NOT support Samsung Super Fast Charging, though it does support Samsung Fast Charging. But since my external battery only supports Fast Charging, I am using this cable.",[],B0974K483T,B0974JL431,AE37TSO66UVAW55ORP7WW2JFQWVA,2023-02-22 12:53:32.130,0,True,503
826436,5,Not Your Moms old Digital Frame!,"Remember back in the early 2000's? (wow Im getting old) and these digital picture frames were all the rage? They seemed great indeed, but the limitation of yesteryears tech really didnt do them justice. They were a pain to get pictures on (moving pictures from memory card to frame) and they looked terrible unless you were looking at them dead on within 3 inches of the frame. They just never really took off because they just didnt work well. And not to mention the horrible burn in they suffered in just a couple of months time. I convinced my young cousin that Uncle Herbs ghost was in every photo of any of our family that was ever taken since you could see his outline in every picture from burn in...<br /><br />Well....let me tell you those problems in the past are gone for good and so sadly is Uncle Herbs ghost! No longer do you have to manually download photos. The app can autosync the photos from whatever source directly to the frame without any intervention! They can also hold tens of thousands of pictures (if not more) Also the LCD tech has come a long way and these can easily be seen from any angle in any light! Colors are vibrant and look just like an actual high quality printed photo. Theres also no more burn in and they are not nearly as thick as theyre old counter-parts. Anyhow lets roll into some pros/cons of this frame in general.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Perfect size @ 11"" (not too big and not too small)<br />-Excellent quality and brightness (easily seen on a bright day)<br />-Frame looks regal and nice (not cheasy like a lot of other plasticy frames)<br />-App and software are crazy easy to use and work off all mediums (ios, android, windows etc)<br />-Easy to wall mount of put on desk (all be it looks best on wall to me)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-You still have to plug it in, not exactly a con, but if you dont do some wire tidying and youve got a wire randomly running around it, it does make it look unappealing. However some basic wire knowledge can fix this.<br /><br />All in all this is the perfect frame for a wall or desk, its clear, concise, and inexpensive compared to other name brand frames.",[],B0BK3SXF37,B0BZSYPRRH,AHWCKHDQBGJCHRKBMIULJ55L65KA,2023-01-22 21:16:02.744,0,False,503
797866,2,Moderate decrease in brightness but definitely more glare,"tl;dr<br />The mounting tabs for removable option not very secure and started to peel away almost immediately.  About what I expected with reduction of brightness but a bit more glare than I was hoping for.<br /><br />Privacy filters like these are always going to reduce the brightness to some extent but some have decent glare resistance.  This filter did reduce brightness but had a bit more glare than I have seen in others.  Make sure you mount it the correct side out because one side appears to be glare resistant and the other side is glossy and very reflective.  Unfortunately the instructions do not specify which side should be out even though the tabs for the peel off shipping protection film is numbered 1 and 2.  It would have been very easy to have the instructions tell you which side to face outward but it doesn't.  Now let's talk about the mounting tabs.  It comes with 2 options.  First, transparent double stick tabs and second, plastic tabs to hold it in place so that the filter can be removed when not needed.  I opted for the second one and I will say that they do not hold very well.  The long tabs that go on the sides have a 2.5mm strip of adhesive and 2.5mm of non-adhesive.  The idea is to stick these on the sides and slide the filter between them where it's not adhesive.  These tabs are lifting so I've had to repeatedly press them back on.  I think they should have made the adhesive portion about 4mm and the non adhesive about 3mm to ensure they will hold for longer.  All in all, it works and does what it's supposed to but the glare and poor adhesive on the mounting tabs are significant issues that should be addressed.<br /><br />Good<br />- Polarization is good and provides privacy at approximately 60 deg angle as advertized<br />- Filter has decent thickness but not so thick it distorts<br /><br />Bad (-2)<br />- Adhesive is not holding very well (-1)<br />- Mounting instructions don't specify which side out but it's relatively easy to tell if you look at both sides and see which side has the anti-glare surface (-1)<br /><br />Ugly (-1)<br />- Glare is much worse than monitor by itself and a bit worse than other privacy filters I've used (-1)","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IhJ3j-hHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IhJ3j-hHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IhJ3j-hHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81oKfk9-C4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81oKfk9-C4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81oKfk9-C4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BNHMGLK4,B0BVB7M81W,AFXYUG75FJNUK43VD22FS366H46A,2023-02-08 21:23:49.058,0,False,503
833904,5,Great tablet for the price!,"[[VIDEOID:c382fb103d8e77459af93b59ccae9944]] I bought this nice, blue Goodtel G10 tablet for my wife, and she just loves it! She enjoys watching movies, YouTube, engaging in all manner of social media, and this tablet handles it all effortlessly. I added a 64 GB microSD card, which was very quick and easy to do, then used the included USB-C cable to transfer some TV shows and movies directly to the tablet. I also connected the included Bluetooth keyboard and wireless mouse, which makes it very easy to navigate and do almost anything you can do when using the onscreen keyboard. I also connected an external Bluetooth speaker, which I only mention because the Bluetooth connection process is almost instantaneous and trouble-free! I tried out both MP4 and MKV files, and both ran perfectly with zero hiccups or ghost images. The display is bright and colorful, and can be seen clearly from an angle, and the built-in stereo speakers can be quite loud when the volume is turned up! And whether you're using the onscreen keyboard or the included keyboard and mouse, navigation is fast and easy. The included case fits very nicely and doubles as a ""kickstand."" making it easy and convenient to watch your favorite movies and videos. Considering the great functional characteristics, the slick Android 12 operating system, AND all the extra items that were included with the tablet, this is an incredible value for the money! Regarding the initial setup, I found that once you add your Google account, that it's best to go to the Android Play Store and install the desired apps one at a time; simply copying all of your backups via Google from another device may result in compatibility issues.<br />If you plan on transferring files from your computer to the tablet via USB-C cable, then you should set up the SD card for ""portable"" transfer of files. If you'd rather that the SD card is used more as an extension of device memory, then choose the other option. All in all, this is a fantastic tablet and and a real bargain for the money! Finally, let me add that this is the second tablet I've purchased via Amazon from JINDAKE, and these folks have the best and most responsive customer service that you'll find.

The micro SD slot, SD slot, Ethernet port, and the HDMI port are all made directly into the body of the case which makes for a very attractive look and design. It has a small blue LED on the top to let you know it has power which is bright enough to see in the daylight but not so bright its obtrusive or distracting. The cord is very short at about 6 inches or 160mm and terminates into a USB type C plug. I have used every feature this little hub offers and everything works flawlessly. The onboard Gigabit ethernet port works straight away without any need to install drivers or change anything in Windows. The HDMI port also works great and came on as soon as I plugged it up. I could not successfully get the HDMI and ethernet port to work simultaniously but I don't think they were meant to as there wouldn't be enough bandwidth to carry both signals at the same time over the USB 3.1 bus. There is also a port on the side which lets you charge things such as a laptop or phone and maxes out at 100Watts. There are 3 USB 3.1 Type A ports on the other side where the MicroSD and SD slots are located. It's nice to have a hub this powerful work right out of the box with ethernet and all these fast ports and it without an external power adapter. I have been using this for a few days now and I am very pleased with it. The price is very good for the quality you recieve. No drivers, no fuss, just plug it in and go. That's the way USB hubs should be and do it all without some clumsy external power adapter you have to lug around with the hub and have to be near a power outlet to even use it. This unit is truly portable and is a must have for those individuals on the go and need a few more ports to plug things into. You can't go wrong here for the price and you won't be disappointed with the quality.",[],B0BNL8S3KX,B0BXD34MSH,AGVHWQ7DO444HSUGQBLO4LIHZR6A,2023-03-03 02:55:21.846,0,False,503
726833,2,Too Good To Be True,"I really wanted this camera to work. I already have two LaView interior cameras as well as 2 outdoor cameras similar to this one (and cheaper) from another brand. I wanted a camera that was compatible with Alexa so I opted for this one instead of the other tried and true wireless battery powered camera by the other brand. I didn’t notice this camera was magnetic until after it arrived and that really made me want it to work. I was thinking I’d be able to upgrade my interior cameras to these to get rid of the wires and have easy mounting.<br /><br />This camera was setup right next to my existing camera for testing purposes and it failed miserably on all accounts. I spent days trying to get this camera to consistently connect to the app but it doesn’t. I would say 1 out of 4 times I would open the app and it wouldn’t connect and/or wake the device. Considering the device is “sleeping” it’s not working to detect motion. I got more notifications that the device was offline than I did motion alerts. When it did detect motion it only took a picture, where the other brand takes a video clip. Next, the battery lasted less than a week following a full charge, while the other camera (that is over a year old) lasts about 4 months where it’s placed. (My other outdoor camera that’s setup in a more remote area with motion detection turned off lasts over 6 months.)<br /><br />I did contact support and they blamed my router, suggested I change it. Yes, because it’s so easy to just change out routers that are owned by the internet company. This was also after I had already informed them that 2 of their own cameras and 2 other cameras that are either of equal distance to or further from the router were working fine. It was also apparently irrelevant that the camera wouldn’t wake to even attempt to connect to the network half of the time.<br /><br />By the time this review is published it will have already been returned. I would not recommend this camera to anyone for any reason because a security camera is not something you can have only working half of the time. I rolled the dice on the price because I have two other cameras that are only a little more than half the regular price of this camera that work fine… I expected the quality of this one to be better.",[],B08H55GYZZ,B0953CV398,AHFBFSQPK3VERKJLZUDD34AEUIAQ,2023-03-19 08:50:34.626,3,True,503
542063,2,Product description,"This looked like just what I needed. I will tell you folks what this thing actually is next.<br /><br />I wanted something to consolidate my audio inputs and give me a remote with volume and input selection. Short story – this unit will NOT do that.<br /><br />I went the used route from Amazon. The first one had no output on the speakers or headphone jack. Amazon, of course took it back. The second one did have speaker output, but the 3.5 mm headphone jack didn’t work. Another review said they tried twice with the headphone jack problem. I wish I had paid attention. You could pull it out a bit and wiggle it into intermittent sound but alas another dud. So back it went.<br /><br />The second one worked good enough to evaluate it.<br /><br />What you have here is a reasonably good analog amp with knob selectors for various line inputs and 2 speaker outputs. You can mix that with 2 microphone jacks with knobs for levels. Knobs for treble, bass, and levels. A knob for output volume. All the analogue works fine with knobs.<br /><br />Then - kludged onto this is, AND TOTALLY SEPARATE, is the blue tooth, radio, digital audio, and remote control. I mean totally separate. The remote only works the kludged part. The volume on the remote only works the kludged part. If there is a signal on the line in, the analog wins and the kludged part doesn’t work at all till you turn the selector to an input with no signal.<br /><br />So, if you can get one that does work, don’t expect the remote to select line inputs or control volume from them. It’s knobs and input selectors for the analog, period.<br /><br />I wasted way too much time on this already. Haven’t tried it all. Just sending back. I will also note that the near useless remote also lacks sensitivity. Point right at it from close.<br /><br />If you want a small analog amp with multiple inputs and microphones for mixing with knob control, get a NEW one and hope. You even get a separate add on gee wiz of Bluetooth, radio, digital audio, …, and a remote for just those add ons.",[],B096L1JL8M,B0C78L3LDC,AHUL4YEG5U5HD4GO4OSVJI2NECQQ,2023-03-24 15:40:40.538,2,True,503
214032,5,"Sturdy, heavy, many pockets","I own a lot of backpacks - for any situation or occasion. Through it all, I have learned a lot of things about them - developed likes and dislikes - what works and what doesn't - and this bag ranks pretty high in my book - for what I needed.<br />I used this for a carry-on bag during my mini trip last weekend, and it was super convenient. The many pockets, zippered or not, helped organize many small items, and I didn't have to bring small bags separately to carry inside this backpack. You have to remember which pocket you used for what, though, or you will end up looking through all the pockets until you find what you are looking for.<br />Zippers work okay - no snags or pulls or hiccups like the cheaper brands. I especially like the zippered/cushioned pocket at the back, and I made sure more important documents were kept there - no way of someone trying to pickpocket that.<br />The zippers for the bigger compartments open all the way, so it is easy to access the things in the bag - just like a suitcase. I keep the zipper tabs towards the bottom of the bag, just in case the zipper decides to roll open by itself - although this bag's zippers have not shown that potential.<br />I usually choose black bags, but what I have come to find out during my travels is that having a bag that does not look like everyone else's could be a good thing in preventing something bad from happening to my bag - at the airport.<br />The bag is not heavy at all - it looks bulky and heavy, but it is not. It just expands and holds so much that you have to be careful not to put too much stuff in it or you might have difficulties standing up. You also have to be mindful of the size of the bag you are carrying, or you might end up bumping into everything along the way, or when you turn around you might hit someone and earn a grimace.<br />Its soft shoulder cushions make it comfortable for hours of use. It also has a handle both on the top and the side of the bag in case you want to carry it like a suitcase - which is definitely a useful feature at times.<br />Overall I recommend this backpack - the pink is subtle, and there is no loud, unsightly and humongous logo burnt on anywhere which is a complete bonus.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dW1dmYBjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dW1dmYBjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dW1dmYBjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BKZS6T99,B0BXLDLK5M,AER6RGQ2SEUB5YM5LCXVUHWGVMBQ,2023-01-25 21:05:13.052,14,False,503
533790,1,Not happy with purchase and here’s why.,"My main complaint is the charger. It is way too sensative! I have listed some things I’ve run into when using these earbuds.<br /><br />Charger:<br /><br />The charger itself will charge without it being plugged in. However, it stops in the middle of a charge. I find this earbud charger extremely sensitive. One slight move of the charger and the earbud magnets will slide off the charger magnets and you’ll wake up in the morning wondering why your earbuds didn’t get charged. The charger is very touch sensitive. It’s also very sensitive to movement.  Actually very annoying when you are trying to place the earbuds just right inside the charger.  Even when you know they are placed correctly one will stop charging at the slightest movement.  I haven’t figured out a way around this.<br /><br />Charging Colors:<br /><br />The case does light up and change colors. But sometimes they stop changing colors and just light up Green.<br /><br />Earbuds are easy to loose.<br /><br />I left them in the charger overnight and brought them to work. Not realizing they had fallen out of the charger somehow. Some people say these are comfortable. They hurt my ear canals. Just being honest here. They did not come with any earbud covers.  These earbuds have good sound quality.<br /><br />I haven’t figured out how everything works yet. They sit in your ear canal a certain way. That’s how they will stay secure. However, working with these for a while I find they are very sensitive. Meaning, you have to place them on the magnetic chargers just right or they might not get charged during the night. One day I had found only one of my earbuds was charged and not the other.<br /><br />Overall, having these for a few day now I find these more of a bother to work with because the charger is extremely sensitive. Today, 1/16 I did not even get 4 hours of use time and my earbuds shut down. They are not worth it. They need to redesign the charging case in a way so that the earbuds will stay put and not slide around.  I will be looking for other earbuds with a better designed charging case.",[],B0B8QK6SDM,B0BJ4FR531,AFCIXQUKMPCJ3LMPGVIEGDAHNPPA,2023-01-21 23:46:06.551,0,True,503

22435,2,Not the greatest,"We got these cameras for both inside and outside of our home.<br />I have so many different issues that I don’t even know where to start.<br />First of all, the quality of the picture isn’t great. If there were ever a time when someone was caught on one of our cameras, I don’t believe their face would be caught well enough for police to be able to identify who they were. Much less for me to discern my neighbor from a complete stranger. I say this mostly regarding night vision and not so much day but the range on either is not great. Even if you zoom, it doesn’t seem to help the graininess of the picture.<br />Secondly, the fact that I have to keep hitting a “continue” button to keep watching live view is maddening. If you don’t catch the button fast enough, love view ends and then you’re met with a “system busy” message when trying to pull it back up.<br />To add to that, you can’t save your live view session unless you pay for the subscription plan. Even if you have an external drive attached to your sync module.<br />Which leads me to my third issue. Everything is made difficult without the blink subscription. Certain features are blocked completely which, to an extent, is understandable. But features such as saving live view and the cameras taking a picture every hour shouldn’t be limited to the subscription plan if I have an external drive installed and am connected to wifi. It seems to just be their way of tempting you into caving and getting their subscription service.<br />The last thing I will mention here is the delay. While there is a delay when you are watching live view, that’s not the delay that bothers me. Many times I get an alert for motion but when I view the clip, the delay is so large in the motion event and the start of recording that I usually don’t even end up seeing what caused the motion. The motion detection on these cameras definitely have room for a lot of improvement.<br />All in all, if you’re just looking for something to monitor but not necessarily for something that you can roll back the tape, check specific times during the day, or actually see motion the moment it happens, then they’re not terrible. But definitely not worth the price if you ask me.",[],B086DKGCFP,B08F6GPRH6,AFCSQ4GU6ZX7CNJLPOTCCNSA2PUA,2023-01-10 17:14:40.916,1,True,503

557228,4,Comparatively great,"For the first time, I think, I find myself writing a review in comparative terms. I mean, if I had only ever bought this frame, I probably would rate it lower. However, compared to the appalling previous frame I bought (and returned at a loss) from another manufacturer, this is truly marvelous.<br /><br />The frame works pretty much as advertised. It is easy to set up, and it has a feature that I really like: it can be set up as a Samba server, so that you can upload images directly from your computer via your local network. While this is not particularly hard to set up, if you don’t have some technical knowledge, this task may be out of your reach though.<br />For me, it made all the difference between the frustrating experience trying to load images with the previous frame, and simply dumping the images here directly from my laptop. So much easier and faster!<br /><br />The app method is very weird, though. For some odd reason the only other way to load images remotely is via email. So the app allows you to select up to 30 images, which it then compresses and sends as email.<br />I don’t like this, and I don’t use it, so I’m glad for the direct network alternative.<br /><br />Some of my peeves are:<br />It does not play HR video. I can’t be bothered to convert and compress my videos, so I’m only using it for still images.<br />It claims to have a “motion detection” setting, which should activate the frame only when it senses motion in the room. I have not been able to get this to work.<br />The web radio setting is inconsistent. It plays for a while, then it stops, and if you want to continue listening, you have to go and find your radio station and set it to play again.<br />The clock, even in its smallest setting, is a very obtrusive analog clock animation, and it can’t be moved from its default position. So I have it off.<br /><br />Regardless, the images look good, and the frame works consistently on the on-off schedule I set so, again, I am comparatively very satisfied.<br />I still think manufacturers could do a much better job with the user interface and features, though.",[],B00MTWDG6W,B00MTWDG6W,AFSHXPEFJDVHSOB2C4FVKKIWKCFA,2023-01-24 14:28:55.197,10,True,503
61852,4,Good way to improve your WiFi network with a caveat,"Let's start saying that this product work as it is supposed and is very easy to setup but not all devices like them.<br />I live in a typical Suburb House with a Basement, ground floor and upper level where there is a Home Office. I use AT&T fiber because is a Passive Optical Network and the modem can (and is) powered using a 12 VDC battery power supply. I have all NEST & RING cameras powered with batteries too and before eero I used MEDIALINK WiFi routers, that for several years worked great but each floor level had a different network and was really annoying to remember that sometimes we had to adjust the phone or tablet as we moved to different levels. These MEDIALINK devices also work with 12 VDC so in the event of an outage I got the peace of mind that neither the Internet service or my internal network will give me an outage. The last utility power issue we had left the house for 6 hours without power but we could still work on our laptops, tablets, etc. I decided on eero because of some reviews but also feedback from other users. For the initial setup each camera was hooked into a UPS to prevent issues until I could power them with batteries. The first thing I noticed when the system was setup is that a couple of NEST cameras, one YAMAHA receiver and my Canon 7500 printer did not like this network, had to temporarily stop the 5GHz section until these devices joined the network. After everything was setup I purchased some 12 VDC to USB power adapters so I could move the cameras to a more reliable power source. I picked the eero I installed in the basement for a try but to my surprise none of the adapters I purchased, some of them the same I use to power the Nest cameras, worked for the eero. As soon as I plug the USB-C cable to the eero a yellow light starts to blink indicating that there is a power supply problem. I also tried using different cables and USB power supplies, each one of them gave the same issue. I researched on the eero site and they do not offer a 12 VDC adapter and wont use a power inverter due to un efficiency. So far the eero devices are powered by APC UPSs but if a power outage hit us won't be able to get more than 20 minutes of power. This certainly the most concerning issue and from my perspective is a drawback for the eero design team.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/5115Hja7YUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/5115Hja7YUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/5115Hja7YUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085VQVPJK,B085VQVPJK,AE7MFIJ54DG6Z44JSPP75GZCASMA,2023-02-19 13:51:26.458,4,True,503
473497,5,Actually useful review- its one of the best camera cases I've ever used,"Honest review, after I've had this camera case for years. I've put it through the extremes - beach vacations, boat charters, skiing, concerts, four-wheeling, hiking, horseback riding, Las Vegas, airports, in the wind, rain, cold, heat, all my activities over the course of my many adventures- and I take hundreds of photos on each trip. It hasn't stained, ripped in any way inside or out, deformed, or faded. No issue whatsoever with any of the zippers. It has a plastic or thick cardboard piece internally that does wonders helping with protection. Its gotten drenched in rain or ocean water splash and its kept my Canon G7X camera dry. Its a perfect fit for the GX7 too. The front pocket holds two extra batteries and a large size SD card all at the same time. There is no room for cables or the charger, but when I take my camera out for use, I generally want to have as little on me as possible, so I don't want the charger or cord with me anyway. It is small enough to not get in my way, yet big enough to fit the camera snugly and with the red material in front, I can find it in seconds when I'm in the car and I'm handling cell phone, maps, brochures, snacks, purses etc. I look around and find I'm sitting on a red case that I was scared I left somewhere.<br /><br />The only gripes I can find is that it doesn't have a wrist strap or loops/rings on both sides to attach a strap. I used a camera strap from an old camera and put it through the zipper ring, that gave me ability to carry it securely around my wrist. But I am going to look for a case that does have dual rings so I can carry it around my neck. Otherwise I was trying to stuff the case in my back pocket if I didn't want it swinging from my wrist or carrying it in my hand.<br /><br />The only reason I am switching to a different case is that I worry there is beach sand imbedded in it from so many Caribbean beaches that I've taken this case to, and I want a clean fresh camera case for a new G7X that just arrived, and I want to keep this camera clean of sand because I ruined my other camera by letting sand get all in the inside and never having it cleaned.",[],B0050DXRQG,B00DM1Y046,AHQPDHPMCVNVNPI7THUV7TZMPCRQ,2023-03-08 14:30:11.583,0,False,503
738347,4,Supports Samsung Fast (but not Super Fast) Charging,"In order to charge my phone in my neoprene phone pouch (sized to fit both my Samsung Galaxy 22+ phone and my Anker Powercore Slim 10000 PD) I wanted to have a cable that would support the Samsung Fast Charging (but not Super Fast Charging) that this external battery supports.<br />Eventually some company will make a similar, phone-size/phone-shape slim charger that supports Samsung Super Fast Charging, but we're not there yet.<br />So as to fit neatly in the phone pouch, I wanted a cable with right-angle USB-C male plugs on both ends.<br />I found three here on amazon, but couldn't figured which would be best. So I ordered all three to do some camparison testing to report for all three cables.<br />Here are the three I bought, with my analysis of each.<br />zdyCGTTime: The cable is short (~20 cm/7"" between the centers of the two plugs). The cable itself is thick and stiff and doesn't bend well. When plugged into a wall charger that supports Samsung Super Fast Charging, the cable also supports it. However, I found that the USB-C male plug would lose the connection with my phone when it was jiggled so I discarded this as an option.<br />AAOTOKK: this superficially looks similar to the zdyCGTTime cable, but longer (~32 cm/12.5"" between the centers of the two plugs). Like the zdyCGTTime, the cable is thick and stiff and supports Super Fast Charging. Unlike that zdyCGTTime, the plug fits securely in the phone's USB-C socket and no amount of wiggling causes it to lose contact. It supports Samsung Super Fast Charging, and even if the longer cable is heavier and bulkier, the length allows it to lie next to the phone/external battery so fits better into the pouch. If my external battery supported Super Fast Charging this would be my choice.<br />KOOWOD: like the AAOTOKK, this cable is longer, but the cable is thinner, lighter and much more flexible, bends easily and sits happily in my phone pouch next to my phone and external batter. It does NOT support Samsung Super Fast Charging, though it does support Samsung Fast Charging.

I haven't listened for DAC quality because I won't be using it that way.<br /><br />The product photos show a ""power indicator"", but I think that might just be a hole to expose bleed-through from the TOSLINK emitter, which seems to be always on, even if you choose a non-digital config.  Hey, it works!<br /><br />There are configurations which include ""mono microphone"", even though none of the documentation mentions such a feature -- I didn't try this, so while the USB sound chip almost certainly supports it, I don't know if it works on this device.<br /><br />The packaging is minimal.  There's a tiny booklet written in broken English, and I can't figure out what some of the sentences are even intended to mean.  There are (minor) contradictions between the product listing, the tech support answers here, the booklet contents, and the front of the box.  Don't buy this if you expect a fully comprehensible manual.<br /><br />In software, it reports itself as ""C-Media Electronics Inc."", with the C-Media vendor ID.  This is a C-Media chip, on a board with a couple connectors, in a little metal box.  That's not necessarily bad (or good), but that's all it is.<br /><br />This is a nice (and cheap) little box for bus-powered USB to stereo S/PDIF.  For 5.1, you may want to use HDMI audio to avoid compression.  For analog, you may want a nicer DAC, and maybe a hardware volume control and a full-sized headphone jack.  There's really only one use case where I'd choose this device, but for that one use, it works fine.",[],B07SR7BYD6,B07WR93R39,AGFQZSHI52YYXUB7ACNM3BQT3P5A,2023-04-12 19:31:36.264,0,True,502
601313,5,"A very capable computer, moreso than I think most will realize","I live and breathe tech and love everything about these mini PCs. From the engineering, to the performance, to how much raw power they are cramming into these boxes--mini PCs have come a very long way.<br /><br />The thing is, most folks have a monitor lying around. They have a keyboard. They have a mouse. If you're looking for an exceptionally capable, budget friendly setup for sub $300, this SER5 is extremely compelling.<br /><br />We're talking a 6 core, 12 thread ZEN3 chip boosting up to 4GHz. Yeah, its not top of the line, but at a 15W TDP, you're sipping power and still able to do some entry level gaming off the APU. This thing easily handles multiple running applications, light video and image editing, plenty of browser windows, etc.<br /><br />Worth noting, the max boost for AMD processors is the maximum frequency achievable by a single core on the processor running a bursty single-threaded workload. Max boost will vary based on several factors, including, but not limited to: thermal paste; system cooling; motherboard design and BIOS; the latest AMD chipset driver; and the latest OS updates.<br /><br />The other beauty of this little machine is the accessibility for upgrades. Just pop off the bottom plate and you'll have access to the SATA bay for additional storage, the RAM and the NVME. So if needed, you can install up to 64GB DDR4-3200/LPDDR4X-4267 (this is the technical max that the CPU supports, not a chipset limitation) and you can upgrade the NVME to any PCIe 3.0 M.2 2280 (I'd go Samsung 970 EVO Plus--inexpensive and will max out the PCIE3x4 pipe).<br /><br />And then there's the native 3 display support. Most options at this price point can output to 2 displays at 1080p and then you'll need an external Display Link adapter for the 3rd. Natively handing 3 x 4k displays is impressive to say the least and for those who need multiple monitors, its always a plus to not need a 3rd party intermediary device to facilitate.<br /><br />Anyhow, I could go on and on but at the current price of $299, heck, even at its normal $320, this is an easy recommendation.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BivzQmE8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BivzQmE8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BivzQmE8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B778BNFG,B0B778BNFG,AE2OQE64GONQ7RO46NS2BCN3IZ7Q,2023-02-08 02:33:27.581,3,True,502
449220,3,Decent option (but doesn't have 360* swivel as advertised),"I'll start by saying that the installation was pretty easy, and the mount seems like it'll work pretty well. With that being said, it's not perfect. And required some minor modifications and installation adjustments<br /><br />The biggest issue I found is that it definitely doesn't have the advertised 360* swivel action. In reality, there's basically no swivel if installed as outlined in the instructions. Fortunately, the solution is pretty simple. Just remove one of the two bolts that comes installed in Pan & Tilt component that attaches to the mounting plate (see picture). It'll still be plenty strong with only one bolt installed, and will then allow you to easily swivel/rotate the projector from side to side. A nice bonus is that it frees up an additional M5 bolt (which will come in handy later).<br /><br />Another minor issue I found was that the included hardware to mount the bracket to your projector was insufficient. They specifically include m3 and m4 bolts for mounting the bracket. But many projectors use an M5 thread pattern. Fortunately, there were a couple extra M5 bolts. And by choosing to install only one M5 bolt in the pitch holes (also pictured). And by removing the above mentioned M5 bolt to allow for swiveling the projector. There were just enough M5 bolts left for the bracket to projector mount.<br /><br />Other than that, everything went together pretty easily. My projector's footprint is a little smaller. So I had to swap in the two included Small Plates into the bracket. I also didn't use the included expansion bolts (anchors), as I was able to secure the mounting plate directly to a solid wood surface. However, to do this the holes in the mounting plate weren't ideal. So I drilled a couple new ones on each side. In doing so, the metal seemed pretty soft. But should still be good enough for this application.<br /><br />Overall, it's a pretty good value. And may work just fine for folks without any modification or installation adjustments. Once installed, it's fairly sturdy, even though the metal seems to be a little soft.<br /><br />Giving it 3 stars because if installed as instructed, the advertised 360* degree swivel functionality is non-existent. And while this was an easy fix, the claim of 360* swiveling was not at all accurate.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DYakGwB4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DYakGwB4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DYakGwB4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bCWutMqSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bCWutMqSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bCWutMqSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gYOttouFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gYOttouFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gYOttouFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aGA-JygIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aGA-JygIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aGA-JygIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fwY3XhFrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fwY3XhFrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fwY3XhFrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09P1G3L1D,B09NYP1Y6B,AG3YPKCQL7KIAAROEYXHMTC22MUA,2023-03-27 15:07:48.042,2,True,502
347329,5,This is really nice.,"This is getting bad reviews by others - felt I should give my 2 cents.<br /><br />I bought an IR 'fill' light which showed up weak...and pitiful. I am unsure the purpose of a fill light in IR but it was a waste of money. I bought this - at a similar wattage and function - to see if my expectations were wrong. This is a 'flood' light and not a fill light...so note I'm not expecting them to be identical. But this one is WAY WAY WAY brighter. Both are 940nm which is usually only good to 30-40' due to the wavelength...but this easily hits 40' out to 50' and with lots of bleed off out to 60'. If you've ever observed anything approaching a light source from the darkeness you'd be able to imagine how this works...first a shape is seen...then the shape takes form, then details can be seen then they become clearer clearer bright brighter BRIGHT TOO BRIGHT! That's just  how IR illuminators work!<br /><br />What's also nice about this one is the fact it has a day/night sensor as well as a button to be always on or use the sensor.<br /><br />It's heavy and chunky and NOT discreet AT ALL...so make sure you verify dimensions and recognize that this thing WILL STAND OUT...it's not svelte or tiny by any means...but on the plus side, lots of chunky aluminum heat sinks on the rear. Note also this doesn't come with a power supply so you'll have to grab that also - which does add to the overall expense...12vdc/3a. Note that transformers or wall warts of this size start to get chunky...you may opt for a plug style where the plug is a big housing and takes up multiple plug spots...or you may consider the plug with cord to a 'brick' style. So keep that in mind that you'll have to get one. I tested mine on 12v/2a and it worked...but I suspect the LEDs weren't outputting to their max. And usually power supplies are oversized - so 3a may be a safety margin...I don't know what they actually pull in amperage - but I've got on order a 3am and I may update this review later to mention the differences between 2a supply and 3a supply.",[],B00Q15GLHE,B00Q15GLHE,AHBC5BOWPQ7JLHVKSV2WO3RXPNUA,2023-03-03 02:26:38.682,0,True,502
767668,3,"Good product, not for me","I bought these so I could finally stop having to constantly push my AirPods back in my ear at the gym. Initially I really liked them.<br />Pros:<br />The teal color is very pretty and I loved the oval shape of the headphones.<br />They’re very comfortable to wear and I didn’t have the issue of them slipping off or being too tight or loose. For reference, I have a biggish head and even bigger hair and I also have 6 piercings, 2 of which are still quite sensitive. They didn’t cause me any discomfort at all.<br />Battery life is also really good. I’ve had them for a few days and haven’t needed to charge them yet. The little light is still green so I’m taking that to mean full battery.<br />Controls are easy, functional, and make sense. Without using my phone, I can turn them on and off, adjust volumes, pause and resume, and and skip and restart songs.<br /><br />The meh:<br />The sound quality is just alright; I definitely prefer my AirPod pros.<br />The noise cancellation on these is not exactly noise canceling, but rather the speaker just plays loud enough to drown out any outside noise. This is different than AirPods which automatically cancel out noise whether anything is playing or not.<br /><br />Con:<br />I found just one real con but for me it’s a deal breather; it’s the fact that sound from the headphones BLEEDS. SO. BAD. If I take them off, I can still hear the audio even when it’s on the lowest bar! I wish I wasn’t exaggerating. This ruined the product for me because I like to listen to my music loud and the point of wearing earphones for me is to not have to disturb those around me but with these I may as well be playing music/videos straight from my phone on high volume because it’s THAT loud.<br /><br />TLDR; If you’re not worried disturbing other people and just need something loud, pretty, comfortable, hands off, and with great battery life, you will love these headphones.

67792,4,Incredible Value for the Price!,"My wife has the Apple Pencil (Gen 2) and I was going to buy same until I found this. The Apple Pencil (referred to as “AP” in the rest of this review) is 5 times the price of this one so I figured I’d try it out.<br /><br />I was worried it wouldn’t  work with my iPad since I’ve had other non-Apple accessories that had problems. It seems like many off brand devices don’t work well with Apple products. There was no problem at all with it.<br /><br />While the AP is a Bluetooth device and you have to pair it with iPad before you can use it, this stylus works off of capacitance and didn’t need pairing. I just opened Goodnotes, clicked the on button, and started writing.<br /><br />It writes smoothly, but there are differences between it and the AP as you can see in the picture. The fine setting is finer than the AP, but the thicker 2.0mm setting is a lot less. If I were using it to draw this may be a deal breaker, but I will only use it to take notes so not a big deal to me.<br /><br />It is magnetic and sticks to the iPad similar to the AP, but it will not charge the same way. One thing that is annoying is the cover for the USB charging port is on the same side as the flat, magnetic portion. Because of this it doesn’t stick flush with the iPad. It would have been nice to have the USB on the opposite side so this wasn’t a problem. One more issue is the flat portion (charging side) of this stylus is not as pronounced as the AP and it has a tendency to roll across the desk whereas the AP does not. (Maybe I am knit picking, but those two features are the reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5. If they aren’t that big of a deal to you, you will love this stylus.<br /><br />It took about 15 minutes to fully charge and I really like the blue battery/charging indicator. It comes with the charging cable and 3 replacement tips.<br /><br />Are the features of this device and the design as sleek as the AP? No, but for the $$$ savings, it will work just fine for me.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DyXpHAg-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DyXpHAg-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DyXpHAg-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LOeLlfRrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LOeLlfRrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LOeLlfRrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BMKMQFN4,B0BVLDFF2S,AFEQG6SVNKELIL6AUWCPBLX5N7OQ,2023-01-16 03:58:22.075,6,False,502
538411,3,Update with Fixes on the Way…,"Update:<br /><br />I’ll start by saying Eufy support is top notch. They reached out to address some of my concerns.<br /><br />1. Regarding the light attachment to the base. I was told they are implementing a fix to secure the light to the base top and bottom.<br /><br />2. HB integration end of March. This should resolve the human detection and image quality issues I personally have. My 2k doorbell cam runs on HB 3 and is a great camera. I’m assuming this light running on HB will be the same.<br /><br />The light features and functions itself are great. I have no issues with that at all.<br /><br />All-in-all, with the base fix and HB integration I’d say this will be a solid buy.<br /><br />Quick summary:<br /><br />- Crappy light attachment to base<br />- Doesn't utilize Homebase<br />- Poor human detection<br />- Subpar image quality<br /><br />I have three Eufy S300 4k cameras, one 2k doorbell, bunch of entry sensors and now this wall light.<br /><br />First complaint is the how the light attaches to the wall base. You screw the base to your wall then attach the light to the base. There is only two tiny screws on the left and right side to secure the light to the base.<br /><br />You can see from my pics the weight of the light pulls it away from the base creating a gap. 100% water is getting in there. There should be a screw in the top and bottom as well.<br /><br />Next the camera quality. It’s pretty poor compared to the 4k which is amazing. It’s even lower quality than my 2k doorbell for some reason. Maybe is the location but I’m not sure. Big fail by not using the 4k camera in this application. Night and day difference.<br /><br />It does not integrate with Homebase. Why release a new product that doesn’t support HB tech? About 20% of my alerts have been false. The camera thinks a red bag sitting on my porch is a human.<br /><br />Huge miss not making this 4k and not integrating with Homebase.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LeQrhk6AL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LeQrhk6AL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LeQrhk6AL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XuBJWu1WL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XuBJWu1WL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XuBJWu1WL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FlmO3zcJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FlmO3zcJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FlmO3zcJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BS27VHRL,B0BS27VHRL,AHB3NHLAXM2C5VZRLP4HJC2EHA4A,2023-02-24 19:58:51.870,33,True,502
328864,5,Well constructed and everything advertised really works!,"This is a compact monitor that comes with all possibly needed cables along with adapters to use if your system happens to need one.  The color accuracy is stunning and clarity is very good even using a three year old integrated Intel graphics chip on my LG Gram laptop.  This is one of the best anti-glare screens I've encountered.  The included cables are solid and clip firmly into ports on the monitor.  The OSD offers every setting  I've wanted including sharpness, brightness, contrast, saturation and preset color temps and the option to create a custom setting with RGB sliders.  There's even an option to change how long the OSD stays open for adjustment.  There are several gamma settings and I found myself using these to achieve the tone I was looking for.<br /><br />I'm using this mainly with a display port connection because I sadly discovered that the USB C port on my laptop is for power only.  However, I tried it on a friend's newer computer just using the USB C connection and it worked quite well.  With this connection the touchscreen seemed responsive and accurate although I only tried it for about 10 minutes.  Considering the specs the monitor is light  and easy to carry around although the case/stand does leave something to be desired.  I've not tried the speakers which are are well placed on the frame.<br /><br />CONS:  this is small but annoying - the OSD ""wheel"" has to be activated and adjusts by pushing it in and then rolling it up and down.  For some reason the piece that protrudes slightly to push in  is almost a sharp point digging into my finger.  Perhaps mine is faulty or it's a bad design.  It's annoying but it is too small an objection to take any stars off considering the quality of the monitor and its performance.<br /><br />I had the good luck to come upon the monitor when it was on special for $50 off but having used it, I think it's still quite a good deal at the usual price.  My only hesitation is the availability of Casking for repairs, tech support etc.  Their website says it's coming soon....

184061,4,Pretty good but lacking some control - 6 Month  Update,"Update after about 6 months: The firmware continues to improve both stability and speed. I now see about 650Mbps when hard wired in to a mesh unit. Wireless connection on non-wifi6 devices is ~400Mbps. I live in a denser part of town, so this is pretty good for wireless.<br /><br />Here's a tip: Setup a weekly reboot of the system, this is done in in the web interface -> Administration -> System tab, then 3/4 way down the page. This will reboot the router and mesh points, no need to log in to the mesh points to setup their reboot. Reboots help with stability and speed.<br /><br />This is a pretty solid setup for mesh wifi, especially Wifi 6. I'm seeing ~540Mbps in real world, high density neighborhood. If you live in the burbs you will likely see better performance.<br /><br />Pros: The setup is just technical enough for me and no too bad if the average person reads the setup instructions first. Pairing mesh units is better than other systems I have used. Something I don't see documented is the WAN port on the mesh units acts as a regular access switch port. Meaning you can hookup a 5th device to the mesh point, unlike the router unit where the 5th port is reserved for WAN (your internet connection). Configuring wireless is pretty easy, leaving defaults is fine for the average person.<br /><br />Cons: I would like a little more control over the mesh units. For example, I would like to easily use one as a bridge, so it does not repeat the main wireless network. Unfortunately, I haven't found a good way to do this and maintain the ease of maintenance. It's not a deal breaker, should would be nice nice to blast the air waves needlessly with my network. Remember, wireless is a finite resource. Finally, this is nitpicking, the user interface is antiquated. I've owned other asus routers over the years, since 2006. The interface is basically the same. I felt right at home but was disappointed there haven't been advances with the interface.<br /><br />Conclusion: It's a good option in the consumer wifi mesh space. It fills my needs enough to be satisfied. I wish there were a few more features.

698078,3,An Okay Bag That Could Have Better Laptop Protection,"This review is for YAJIE Medium Size Laptop Canvas Tote Bag (ASIN: ‎B09QZYF88L). I really wanted to like this laptop bag. I have a Targus laptop messenger bag that I have had for about eight years that I really like. I was looking to see if I could find something that was even better, and unfortunately this YAJIE bag is not it.<br /><br />This YAJIE bag is not terrible, but it is not great. On the plus side, there are multiple compartments, a removable shoulder strap with swivel clips, and a back strap for putting on luggage. Now on to what I don't like. The padding is very thin and flimsy. The compartments could have been improved to be more usable. The zippers are very low quality. I don't like that there is no Velcro strip in the middle of the back strap. I like it because it's more secure for attached to my luggage trolley handle and gives me a better piece of mind (I feel like it is more difficult to steal if I take my eyes off of my laptop bag). I would not want to fly with this bag, since I do not feel confident about the low quality and coverage of the protective padding. I also find the price to be too high for what you are getting. At this price point or slightly more, there are better choices that offer more protection and usability.<br /><br />On a side note, if you are going to be doing any flying with a laptop bag, make sure you get the features you need. If you do not have TSA pre-check, you will want to get a laptop bag that allows you to open it like a butterfly so that you don't have to take out the laptop or wireless keyboard (if you use one). Also, you will want to get a laptop that fully protects the laptop. That means fully covers it and uses quality padding. You will also most likely want to get one that is as close to airline maximum allowable size for carryon purposes. Since this will be the bag you store under the seat, that means you will want to be able to fit more than just your laptop and accessories, like snacks, book, medications, or anything else that you may need or want.

The flashing LED strobes can scare off would be theives, but can startle legitimate visitors.<br /><br />Although I'm still in the ""Testing Phase"" of this camera, bottom line, for the price point, it's a decent camera, but don't expect the 2-Way Audio intercom feature to blow you away.

291978,5,Big sound; small footprint,"The JBL Go 3 measures 1.61"" x 3.46"" x 2.95"" and weighs 10.4 ounces. Despite its small footprint, the JBL Go 3 packs a 1.7"" by 1.9"" full-range driver that delivers up to 4.2 watts of output.<br /><br />I paired the JBL Go 3 with my ASUS Zenbook Duo because they're both blue and the sound this little speaker delivers turns heads. The sound quality is good, bass is present, vocals are articulate and this thing gets far louder than expected from something so small. I was listening to music outside my favorite coffee shop and a passerby looked at my speaker and said ""no way...you must be paired with something else."" I said nope and held up this JBL Go 3 to show him the JBL Go 3 was my only speaker and he replied, ""Oh, it's JBL -- no wonder."" That was the end of the conversation with no other explanation necessary. JBL has set a performance standard and this JBL Go 3 lives up to it in its own diminutive way.<br /><br />What I liked most about the JBL Go 3 was:<br />- Highly portable<br />- Big sound despite its small size<br />- Dust and water resistant<br />- Stylish<br /><br />What I liked least about the JBL go was:<br />- Battery life. I didn't get 5 hours on a single charge from this speaker but I probably play it too loudly to get those results.<br />- No sub-bass. Even though this is JBL and it packs plenty of bass, physics doesn't allow this speaker to produce much or any sub-bass.<br /><br />Overall, if you have to take a single speaker along with you during your daily commute then the JBL Go 3 might be the one. The JBL Go 3 looks and sounds great, is dust and water resistant, has a built-in carrying loop, and weighs a mere 10 ounces. While this speaker packs plenty of bass there are some people who are going to expect sub-bass from any JBL product and that crowd might not be happy with the amount of sub-bass this speaker produces. That said, for the vast majority of people this is an excellent, cost-effective way to experience JBL sound. 4.5 out of 5.0",[],B0BB86G4HN,B0BBWLP9KV,AHD3NGMLEO26ICLLAF72W7ELLUNA,2023-02-11 01:14:11.389,1,False,502
856874,5,Solid Wi-Fi Based Camera with Solar Charging Capabilities,"The camera was easy to set up with the included hardware.<br /><br />First thing I did was to fully charge the battery to see how it would perform with no solar panel. It has been running for over a week now and is still at over 60% charge. With the solar panel to provide ongoing charging, power should not be an issue; even with several days of cloudy weather.<br /><br />Setting up the camera is pretty straight forward and handled through the app. Once the app is loaded and you provide credentials for your Wi-Fi, a QR is provided to scan with the camera to get it connected. This is similar to other Wi-Fi based cameras I have used. You get both instructions in the manual, on screen with the app, and voice prompts coming from the camera. Once set up you can control the pan, tilt, and zoom function live from your phone. You can also access stored images or videos, switch between SD and HD, activate the white light, sound, and microphone. There are a number of other settings you can customize beyond this.<br /><br />Video quality is fine with this. I generally keep it in SD, and find that is generally sufficient. Images and video can be stored to the cloud using a subscription service, or you can opt to store them to a Micro SD card. I did this. It uses a looping function, meaning if the card fills up, it goes back and records over the oldest clip. Night time images are in the expected grayscale unless you choose to activate the built in light, in which case it will switch to color. You also have the option to manually start recording or snap an image from inside the app. Otherwise, it will activate when motion is detected and record for the time specified on your settings.<br /><br />There is sound available too. It is probably the low point of the camera. It works, but is fairly low quality. The sound allows you to hear what is happening around the camera, and by activating the mic, you can also talk to who ever is there. This is a great way to mess with your kids.<br /><br />Additional settings you control are the camera name, you can flip the image orientation, set motion detection sensitivity, and even arm or activate an audible alarm.<br /><br />Overall I am very satisfied with this camera. It offers a lot of features and control at a reasonable price.",[],B0BLCTFBYD,B0BLCTFBYD,AGYL5Q5AVFXZGKW2AEID5TFFZC3Q,2023-01-12 21:13:56.878,0,False,502
418491,5,Very easy to set up and control. Provides excellent coverage and video image.,"[[VIDEOID:bcfff113d3805e166adbb328524b17bb]] I've been wanting a means of monitoring conditions in my house while away for extended periods. I purchased a POE system with hard drive, 8 channels and 4 stationary cameras. I decided to add two Noonkey 2K/3MP Light Bulb Security Cameras to the system as well, adding the ability to scan conditions that stationary cameras can't.<br /><br />The Noonday cameras were an absolute breeze to set up and connect to my system, and the EseeCloud app is capable of selecting and controlling any camera. These cameras can work standalone without any system simply using the app, but I was really surprised with the seamless integration with my system.<br /><br />If you can screw in a light bulb and download an app, then you can install the Noonkey Security Cameras and have a solid surveillance system in place in no time. Now the biggest hurdle may be finding a light socket in your home with downward hanging incandescent light fixture or electric socket in an area you want to monitor! I'm not kidding about this. My home is older and there are only a few light sockets that point downward. The camera doesn't perform as well without this bit of infrastructure. I removed the light fixture just inside my front door, and also in my basement, and chose those locations to install my Noonday cameras.<br /><br />Using the EseeCloud app on my iPhone, the cameras were recognized immediately, and ready to go without any issues. Capable of 360 degree horizontal and 90 degree vertical rotation, the Noonkey camera can see any conditions around it. The images are clear and sharp, and with illumination for full color night vision, the images are great, far better than the stationary cameras sold with my system.<br /><br />I have a lamp on a timer set to come on for a good part of the evening so that gives me additional illumination source for the camera to monitor temperature and conditions in my home.<br /><br />I'm not concerned about criminal activity, but mainly concerned about power failure and heat loos during winter while I'm away. If my cameras go out, temperature on the nearby temperature gauge falls below thermostat setting, or any other unusual activity occurs, I can call someone to intervene in my absence.<br /><br />Overall, I'm completely satisfied with the Noonkey wireless cameras.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NDjznhK0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NDjznhK0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NDjznhK0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jvo+Y0x5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jvo+Y0x5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jvo+Y0x5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sxHTXmyML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sxHTXmyML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sxHTXmyML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BM4M4CV3,B0BVVYNB6Q,AGODU4BBGM2GMGKJBYR3JODXUX2A,2023-02-17 17:25:50.327,2,False,502

It would eat up desk space/cabinet space.<br />It does come with a nylon bag to toss it all in to though.<br />It takes a long time to charge.  I charged it Fully before testing.  It does have some good suction.<br />but It really has limited uses.  THE BATTERY TAKES A LONG TIME TO CHARGE and according to the ""percentage of charge display""on it,  IT DRAINS AMAZINGLY QUICKLY, SUPER FAST!<br />It does not have a bunch of good uses that could not be done with other things.  Not Amazingly good at what it does.  IT IS ESPECIALLY LIMITED BY HOW FAST THE BATTERY DRAINS and how slowly it recharges.<br />You would have to always have it out charging.  From my limited amount of testing use it seems like its little filter would be rapidly clogging up and needing cleaning and drying.  As it is now for its use it is limiting because of charge/charging issues and Eating Up, wasting space.  it is kind of a hassle at it is.  It seems a bit gimicy to me and a bit of a first prototype, rought draft kind of an item.  I'm not sure how many ""balls/rafts or air matresses"" you are going to get inflated before it goes dead, and then the long charging time.  If you have some constant need to be vacuming your keyboards or something VERY QUICKLY every day. Maybe this is something for you.  OR MAYBE I GOT A DEFECTIVE ONE AND IT SHOULD HOLD A CHARGE LONGER?  I can litteraly see the charge imediately and RAPIDLY going down when it is turned on.<br />I don't know, but as it is now for me, it would be more of a hassle to mess with than it is worth. I can see it would just become a space eater and dust colector.  It needs to go back. BUT IF YOU HAVE  a use for a quickly going dead lilttle air pump vacume thing.

349109,3,Decent low cost camera with a few annoyances,"The camera is a decent pan and tilt camera that needs better instructions and the app could use some work also. For the money you pay, you can't expect an 8k camcorder that will do everything! For the price point, this is what you get. It is a basic webcam with pan and tilt options. 2-way audio is ok but if you don't install the app on your phone you cant use it like a bunch of other features. Power cord a WAY too short. Like most things now  days it is a usb cable with the power block at the end but the included usb cable is so short you would have to be right at a socket in order to plug it in. Other annoyance is you have to push the camera the whole way up to access the sdcard slot and reset buttons. It doesn't tell you if you can do it by hand or have to do it through the app so hopefully doing it by hand doesn't hurt is as that is what a lot of people will be doing. Picture quality is pretty darn good for a camera in the price range and I have no problems with that other than the lack of zoom...yea, no zoom! I guess you could digitally zoom in but they missed the ballpark with not including that. You will get color in the day and black and white at night (like I said, low cost webcams all do this). Not too loud while panning or tilting but the motion tracking is spotty. It could work perfectly for a while and then just have a fit and start tracking a piece of paper that hasn't moved lol. Anyway it really is not bad for the price!<br /><br />As for the cloud stuff - I HATE IT!!!!!!!! These subscription things are horrible! I don't want a webcam that will be using my internet to transfer pictures online  especially when I do not even know where they are going! I could do packet sniffing and figure everything out but I should not have to. I should be able to have this use my NAS or JUST the sd-card to capture an not be reliant on he internet for features because they were too expensive to put in the camera.

764466,3,I liked it until I didn't,"**UPDATED**<br /><br />Well the device sh!t the bed. When I turned on the TV this morning I had a black screen. I unplugged the device, waited a minute or two, plugged it back in, and it wouldn't keep any app that I opened open. It would open for a moment, then just close. After trying to open a couple of apps it just froze. Unplugged it again, waited a few moments, plugged it back in, same result.<br /><br />There was also no help that I could find in regards to casting so I never did get that to work.<br /><br />Thank goodness I still had my Roku Ultra plugged into the TV.<br /><br />HiYa!<br />I've been streaming ever since the internet was available to the public. I've used several different methods.<br />I've been using a Roku Ultra for a few years as my primary streaming device. Since the Chromecast with Google TV (HD) was on sale I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />It did not take long to set this up, however I was already familiar with how to set up ChromeCast devices since I own 2 (without Google TV). Setting up the various accounts (2 Google, other apps) was relatively easy with the scanning of the QR codes.<br /><br />The controller is dinky compared to the heavier somewhat larger Roku but it functions just fine. Setting up TV controls was easy. I remember the days of having to look up numbers that coincides with your device, put in the numbers, doesn't work, try different numbers until the tv turns off. This does all that pretty much automatically. Very nice. I've also ordered a cover case for the controller because if you drop it without one it might shatter into millions of pieces.<br /><br />The picture appears crispier than my Roku. The sound is a bit louder also which I like. After adding my other services like Netflix Amazon Prime PlutoTV and such I get a recommendation watching list on the home screen. Navigation is pretty straight forward.<br /><br />All in all I like this device so far. The only reason why I left out a star is because I have not tested the casting capabilities yet.

319211,5,A Very Good Kit for the Money,"The Octa Softbox Lighting Kit is an expansive assembly of the most useful pieces wanted to pursue artificial light photography.<br /><br />Two quite large soft boxes producing wonderfully soft light with their white covers easily installed are simple to deploy; two powerful 135 watt bulbs are controlled by remote control to provide white, warm, or cool temperatures, each with steps from the lowest to the highest of brightness; two tall light stands; individual on/off switches; remote on/off switches; two (empty) weight bags ready to aid balancing; and even gloves with which to protect oneself from hot bulbs if you need to remove them from the soft box before they cool down.  Also, individual storage/transport bags for each folded soft box and a large bag with which to contain the entire kit are here if you wish to go on the road.  Everything required to get in business is included except batteries for the remote control units.<br /><br />The 135 watt bulbs are of higher power than my other kits and are smartly engineered with many large fins to dissipate heat quickly.  Each soft box comes with its own remote controller ( that is, 2 are included) which enable quick changes of the light temperature to white, warm, and cool.  No pairing or complex setup is needed.  They also allow quick changes of brightness with a single button that performs a 20%, a 50%, or a 100% instant result.  And, the remote control will also change brightness in much smaller bites with different buttons from the brightest to the lowest if you don't wish to use the instant buttons.  However, there is no alternate way in which to make these changes.  Only the remote control devices will suffice.  Each controller takes 2 AAA batteries.<br /><br />Either remote controller works with either soft box.  Either one soft box, or the other, or both, is controlled by a single remote control depending on your proximity to the soft boxes.  Nothing difficult.  The controllers can also control on/off.<br /><br />The maximum light produced is very bright and the minimum is quite small.  Thus, a wide range of light is available to the photographer and is completely under his/her control from both soft boxes.  The remote control units work responsively and the light stands are adequate.<br /><br />There is a lot of content here for the price and I find it a very good buy.

918190,4,Great range of motion. Easy to adjust. Tilt function could work better,"I had recently purchased a new 32'' monitor and the base was taking up too much desk area so I thought I'd give this monitor arm a shot. This is my first monitor mount/arm and I'm impressed by what it can do and how easy it is to adjust my monitor.<br /><br />I love that this arm uses a gas spring because adjusting to whatever position I want is a breeze (except the tilting which I talk about later). It took a little adjusting at first to get the gas spring set for my monitor weight but once I had everything set I can move my monitor up, down, forward, backward without adjusting something.<br /><br />So far the gas spring has held up my monitor up nicely and it hasn't dropped down on its own since I originally set it up. I've seen some monitor arms not able to hold up monitors properly but this one has held my 32'' without a problem.<br /><br />I did end up routing my cables though the integrated cable management and I think it looks great. I don't have it that way in my pictures but I'm glad I routed it that way because it keeps all the cables out of sight and it looks much cleaner.<br /><br />I've only had a slight issue with the tilting function of the monitor arm. They show in their listing and videos that the tilting for the monitor either needs tightened or loosened depending on the weight of the monitor and then you can adjust the tilt as needed without messing with the adjustment. On mine I can't adjust it without the monitor tilting forward on it's own so I have to tighten it down all the way. So unfortunately I can't just reach out and tilt my monitor without loosening the bolt, adjusting the monitor, then tightening it back up. This isn't a deal breaker for me but it does make it a little difficult to adjust the tilt on my monitor.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really happy with the monitor arm and it looks good holding my monitor up on my desk. Most of the adjustment is simple and easy especially moving it up and down or moving it forward or back. The tilting can be a pain at times but I don't tilt my monitor that much anyway - I mostly keep it in the same position tilt wise. If you're looking to get a monitor mount/arm I recommend you give this one a shot especially if you have a larger, heavier monitor.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612Cu3bSrcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612Cu3bSrcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612Cu3bSrcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612NW7pMOlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612NW7pMOlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612NW7pMOlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61H4q5UMDgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61H4q5UMDgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61H4q5UMDgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Jm2czwgyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Jm2czwgyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Jm2czwgyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YqkAxCMDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YqkAxCMDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YqkAxCMDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ppSfDRaLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ppSfDRaLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ppSfDRaLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BEjY6bN8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BEjY6bN8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BEjY6bN8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FCYrPNpjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FCYrPNpjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FCYrPNpjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LcQGPkqEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LcQGPkqEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LcQGPkqEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MKi-IE0kL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MKi-IE0kL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MKi-IE0kL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71a05dae+oL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71a05dae+oL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71a05dae+oL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ao+RSnhvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ao+RSnhvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ao+RSnhvL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kDWzwHVzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kDWzwHVzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kDWzwHVzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09Q8YWHHZ,B09Q8YWHHZ,AHO5CQ2B4I4USCQNWBGGSAAVCC2A,2023-02-18 09:44:14.567,0,False,502
938935,4,"Very different look, good features, and a few areas to be improved","This is a really interesting pack that offers a much different look than other 30L competitors I've seen on the market.  I'll comment on some of the features<br />- Baffled padding:  Looks a little like a puffer jacket, and adds some extra padding if you have tech materials.<br />- Curved bottom:  The molded design looks kinda cool, but the bag won't sit flat.  It also would be better made of a rubber or tarpaulin material as it is a dust magnet and may be difficult to clean off dirt.<br />- Side access panels:  I like this design, and it's something similar to the Peak Design Everyday pack.  However, this one only has one zipper.  I'd like to see one at each end for flexibility in opening it.<br />- Zippers: At this price point I'd really like to see YKK, but I don't see any branding.  They're not the most robust zippers I've seen.<br />- Quick access top area:  I like it!  more bags could use this type of design for phones, chargers, and snacks.<br />- Zip-out water bottle holders:  Reasonably large and deep.  Pretty flexible.  I generally don't need two, so one would've been fine to make the other side a fully sealed pocket.  Some of the best designed bags also have TPU linings and drains for water bottle holders.<br />- Harness and back:  Chunky, good airflow.  The webbing on the top of the strap could use a few more stitch points to give better options for carabiners and other latch-on items.  Lacks chest strap for longer hauls.<br />- Laptop compartment: Large and soft, false bottom gives the laptop additonal protection.  Tablet sleeve<br /><br />Overall, I like many aspects of this bag.  I'd rather see some adjustments to the dimensions.  Perhaps an inch narrower and an inch taller might make it easier to manage as an EDC.  If one of the side water bottle holders was sacrificed for a small pocket, I'd like it built out with space for pens, business card area, thumb drives, etc.  Beware that STM will only support the lifetime warranty for approved resellers, so you might check with them before buying from an Amazon 3rd party seller.",[],B099HDBLJT,B09WSSV9L2,AFH4DCFZPPBBRXP3UYJFYOZEY4CA,2023-02-12 05:43:17.255,1,True,502
594850,5,"A fantastic blend of style, sound quality, and comfort","Hey there, fellow music lovers! I just wanted to share my experience with the SAYAPE Noise Cancelling Over Ear headphones. These headphones have quickly become my third favorite ANC headphones, which is better than you might expect considering how many I've tried and the prices I paid for #1 and #2.<br /><br />First off, the noise cancellation on these headphones is quite good. With 4 ANC microphones and 1 voice microphone, they filter out up to 95% of low-frequency ambient sound. That's a maximum ANC depth of 36 dB! With SAYAPE, you can say goodbye to distractions and fully immerse yourself in your calls, music, and movies. Of course, keep in mind ANC does best with regular noises, not necessarily sharp, random noises.<br /><br />Now, let's talk sound quality. The 40mm large dynamic driver units and sensitive diaphragm work together to create rich instrumental harmonies, clear vocals, punchy bass, and a finely balanced sound. Plus, with 4 EQ modes to switch between, audiophiles and music enthusiasts will find new ways to enjoy their tunes.<br /><br />One of my favorite features is the 50-hour playtime. The 700mAH battery lasts up to 50 hours on a full charge, and if you're in a rush, a quick 10-minute charge gives you 2 hours of listening time. And if the battery does run low, the included 3.5mm audio cable lets you switch to wired mode, so you'll never be without your tunes on long trips.<br /><br />The Bluetooth 5.0 technology gave me a stable connection at all times. I was surprised to find out I could connect two devices simultaneously!<br /><br />Last but not least, the premium design and comfort of these headphones are worth mentioning. The cool, retro aluminum alloy vinyl record design has eye-catching metal details that'll make you stand out. The headband is made of manganese steel, and seemed to promise durability and resilience. The soft ear cups can be swiveled and stretched for a perfect fit and they stayed comfy even during long listening sessions.<br /><br />In conclusion, the SAYAPE Noise Cancelling Headphones offer a fantastic blend of style, sound quality, and comfort. They're perfect for anyone who's serious about their audio experience. Give them a try, and I think you'll be pleased with them.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-wAAZUV7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-wAAZUV7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-wAAZUV7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BS9314D2,B0BS9314D2,AHWZFM3REFTPXQZCFGLEC4LGMXDQ,2023-04-12 15:22:49.117,0,False,502
897541,5,A Nice Well-designed Tablet,"I’ve done work as a visual effects designer doing matte painting work with the large 22 in W**** display tablets, and I have a couple older drawing tablets as well. But what I really needed was a smaller mini tablet for quick concept sketches and annotations on work... so when I came across the Huion Inspiroy 2 tablet, I thought I’d give it a shot.<br /><br />THIS IS A NICE TABLET! I’ve heard good things about Huion, and after working with it for a while I totally agree.<br />Pros<br />Stylus Performance: the pen that comes with the tablet is very intuitive to use, and supports pressure and tilt sensitivity. On a whim, I dug out one of my older Intuos 4 pens, and it was recognized by the tablet!<br />Buttons: you get six in a row, and with the software, you can set this tablet up for a right-handed (buttons on left side) or left-handed (buttons on right side) or even in Portrait Mode.<br />Software: the Control Panel for the macOS works great; no weird system issues, and the level of programming for pressure sensitivity, button options for general use vs specific apps is great.<br /><br />Cons<br />Buyer’s Regret: I wish I bought the LARGER size now! But I did want a smaller tablet and this has worked to my expectations. Maybe too good!<br /><br />I’m not sure if this is a Pro or Con for others, but I’m glad that the tablet connects to your host computer with a cable. I have so many other devices that either fight for Bluetooth or has a stupid dongle that plugging in a tablet when I need to just makes sense for me.<br /><br />All the things I am used to doing with my other tablets can be done as well on this Huion. So far after a month of use, I’m impressed with the build quality and the usability of the software. If you are a starting artist, I have no issues recommending this since for $60 it’s a very minor investment for a full-featured tablet. The quality in this Huion tablet was a great introduction to the brand for me, and I’ll definitely consider a larger Huion tablet in the future!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31XkgzbazmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31XkgzbazmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31XkgzbazmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41NQxcQVv8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41NQxcQVv8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41NQxcQVv8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41yI75CmZHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41yI75CmZHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41yI75CmZHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51rYiIiHq3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51rYiIiHq3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51rYiIiHq3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NyRP5zRuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NyRP5zRuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NyRP5zRuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jId02u1UL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jId02u1UL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jId02u1UL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BMKVFDVV,B0BWJNQXLR,AHV7HCJBOWDTOGYZLFNNF3GICW6Q,2023-01-27 16:39:59.243,0,False,502
765829,4,"Easy-to-use 1080p portable monitor with USB-C, MiniHDMI","I got an A1C and a A3C from Arzopa over the last couple of months. They're very similar but have slight differences.<br /><br />The high level summary is that they are great for what they're meant to do. I used them with my Dell XPS 15 9570 laptop, using just USB-C (for power and display/audio). No issues, reasonable audio and good video quality (which is hard to photograph since I was in a bright room at the time I was trying them out). There's a magnetic folding cover/stand that's easily removed. The screen is well-protected when it's closed, so you can leave it in your laptop bag without its own pocket.<br /><br />Here's where we deviate between the two.<br /><br />The A1C is 1080p 15.6"" (1920x1080 wide), with a thumbwheel to control the onscreen display. One side's controls include power/return, the spin wheel for OSD controls/volume/brightness, and a 1/8 headphone jack. The other side has two USB-C ports and a mini-HDMI port. They include a mini-to-normal HDMI cable, C-to-C, and A-to-C. There's also a small wall wart, the size of a phone charger. If your USB-C device<br /><br />I would have preferred a full size HDMI connector, but the adapter cable makes it not as painful as without.<br /><br />The photo of the two monitors isn't meant to show video quality - it's meant to compare to a 15.6"" Ultrabook. Without the glare it's pretty good shape, and plays 4k video (albeit downscaled) pretty well. There are adjustments to make to video settings if you want to enhance - I haven't done that yet as I'm still figuring out how this will get used.<br /><br />All things considered it's a good display for travel or tight spots or sporadic use (where you don't want a full scale LCD monitor on a stand).<br /><br />Note that this sort of monitor is not self-powered. Under average use they probably use 5-10 watts and can be powered from a laptop USB port or a modern USB battery pack if you're not using the USB-C data/video connector for it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61063tuadYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61063tuadYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61063tuadYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sOdzrA-gL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sOdzrA-gL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sOdzrA-gL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7159olU7X7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7159olU7X7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7159olU7X7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IA2qphnIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IA2qphnIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IA2qphnIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BNL225SQ,B0BZ4MVMF3,AEVZ2BE6HETIWIW7U4MFSXPPLYUA,2023-03-26 03:20:50.905,0,False,502
665235,5,Awesome camera with lots personal preference of setting options.,"ieGeek security cam model ZS-GX3S<br /><br />First off like most things I give a review after I have used the item first so as not to give an out of the box review with no knowledge of how things really work. So with that said this camera has it all going for it. It’s a nice size for a outdoor security cam, it feels to be quality made and the performance is superb. I can’t imagine that anyone would expect a higher quality image from an outdoor camera than what this one offers. It’s packed with lots of personal setting options as well, you can set the sensitivity levels for video and audio level to whatever you prefer. You can set when it record, how long it records and where it records. A cool thing about this camera is you can set exactly the area you want monitored (see pictures for example) It’s both a camera and a spotlight, you can activate the spotlight by app or set it to come on when movement is detected. It truly has all the bells and whistles you could want or expect from a much higher dollar camera, it has a siren, strobe/flashing lights if you desire. The battery life depends on how you have your settings, if you set the sensitivity high and it’s in a high activity area then of course your battery won’t last as long however if you set it more conservative it will last quite a long time. Personally I set it to record a large area, sensitivity high and high record time which does use more battery life but I can easily access it for charging so for me it’s a good trade off. To wrap it up it’s truly a 5 star camera in every way. This is not the first camera I have purchased from this company and they too are 5 star. As I go along I will start replacing other outdoor security cameras I currently have with ieGeek cameras. I’ve attached some photos, the ones with the squares colored in are showing how you can select exactly where you want to be notified and recorded, the other images are showing the difference between HD and QHD quality. HD alone is great quality and they took it one step further and added the option for an even better quality with the QHD plus a full color night vision option.<br /><br />Thanks ieGeek for great cameras at prices that are affordable.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716NIuK8GCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716NIuK8GCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716NIuK8GCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81U4AU7HNQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81U4AU7HNQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81U4AU7HNQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81vnvNDsrOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81vnvNDsrOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81vnvNDsrOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91wZ0u9IsbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91wZ0u9IsbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91wZ0u9IsbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09KLJTFW7,B0BQRB9G3Y,AFYALET3V5FUUPAT5QKAXYHVYWVA,2023-01-16 19:09:40.450,8,True,502
692977,5,Better car navigation with this adapter (Yes. Really. Read why.),"My cellphone tells me where to drive. Sometimes it thinks I'm next to the freeway, when I'm already on it. Sometimes it tells me to make a U-turn, but I'm on a one-way street. I thought it was bad software. Turns out it is bad GPS satellite reception. Navigation uses up so much battery, when I'm in the car my phone is always plugged into power. I toss the phone as it charges into the cupholder, and I roll.<br /><br />Let's look at that more carefully.<br />* My phone's GPS antenna is near the top.<br />* My phone's USB-C charging jack is at the bottom.<br />* With a charging cable plugged in, my phone goes into the cupholder upside down.<br />The charging cable, coming straight out of the bottom, doesn't let me stand the phone right-side-up, so the GPS antenna sits in a hole. That's how I've been getting bad navigation advice.<br /><br />I'm able to stand my phone up in the cupholder when I use this right-angle adapter.  My phone now gives excellent directions. This right-angle USB-C adapter gives me better car navigation because my phone can now stand on the charging end while it charges, which it couldn't do before, while it holds the GPS antenna high.<br /><br />That was a lot of improvement for very low cost.<br /><br />One last note:  you are reading a Vine review, which means this product was sent to me without my having to pay for it.  I never believed Vine reviews, I felt people would say anything to get free stuff.  The Vine program, at least for me, is a little different:  I only get what I go out of my way to ask for, and everything I get is reported as income to me, so I'll have to pay income taxes at what will probably be reported as list price.  I may actually lose on the deal.  When I came across this right-angle adapter available for review I skipped it, but something clicked and I realized it might be help me.  I got to try it and see that it very much does help me. This adapter is something I use, I didn't know it existed before I saw it available for review, and, hopefully, my experience has been a help to you.",[],B0BXSGGBZR,B0BXSGGBZR,AGKGD5UXAAWJI44D2FQASPGMPTOA,2023-03-31 08:32:30.621,0,False,502
23951,4,Decent KVM,"Let me start by saying I'm picky with KVMs and I have been through a few.  This one is replacing another unit from another manufacturer which has intensely bright indicator lights.<br />This box is very small and compact for supporting 4 USB and 4 computers.  It feels solid with all metal casing.  The buttons are not the best, but do operate well.  The connections in the back are good for tucking away wires and avoiding clutter.  The USB ports are in the front making them accessible.  This works for me because my mouse and keyboard are using a remote dongle.  If you are using a wired mouse/keyboard, be aware the cords will come out of the front.<br />I love that the external power is included but not required.  A different KVM I owned required power to maintain video signal, this one does not.  That is one less cable to clutter my area.<br />The connections to the PCs are made with separate USB-A and HDMI cables.  For me, this was a disappointment because my pre-existing unit had USB-B connector /HDMI combo which won't work with this unit.  I'll need to rerun the wires.  The USB cables are included, which is good.  However, the HDMI cables are not so you'll need to buy them separately if you don't have any laying around.<br />Switching is easy.  You can either use the front panel buttons to select the PC you want or you can use the tethered remote.  There is no keyboard key-combo to switch between PCs.  This was also a disappointment compared to my prior KVM as I must now reach for another device with a wire on my desk to switch.  Also, note that with a MAC I have a slight problem.  Each time I switch back to my mac, it detects a new keyboard and prompts me to press keys to identify the ""new"" keyboard.  The Mac doesn't remember the keyboard when you switch away and back.  You can click through the notice, but it is annoying.<br />I'm happy to say the lights are not that intense.  They are just enough to see the unit has power and which PC is selected.  It won't light a room ;).<br />Compact, easy to use, and durable.  Definitely a good purchase that would be better with MAC compatibility and keyboard switching.",[],B0BVLNC1F8,B0C694XQJ4,AF3FZM34VQDASKF34UOIUOIHTHSA,2023-03-07 17:52:15.041,0,False,502
913937,2,"Looks nice and appears well made, but compatibility is lacking.","This PoE injector is one that I really wanted to like, as I like the overall appearance and construction of it. It just looks and feels like a nice product. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work that well.<br /><br />Just as a bit of a quick test, I decided to try out three VOIP phones I typically keep on hand. The first a Vtech conference phone (aka SNOM C520) is known for being picky about PoE adapters and is always pretty hit or miss. Well, in this case, it was a miss. It didn't even see the PoE adapter and never lit up at all. On its own, this usually doesn't bias me too much against a PoE switch or injector, as that is just a quirk of that model phone and likely means it isn't totally 802.3af compliant in some respect.<br /><br />Next, I moved on to a phone that has always worked with everything I have hooked it to: a Grandstream GXP-1625. Well, while it lit up and was receiving power from the adapter, the phone never booted, which really surprised me. I even went back and tested the phone on another PoE switch just to verify that it was still working ok (which it was).<br /><br />As a final test, I moved onto a Fanvil X6U and it fired right up, pulled an IP address, and connected to Asterisk.<br /><br />So...one out of three really isn't the best luck. The SNOM I could forgive, but not working with a Grandstream is pretty rare. All I can think of is that the two phones it did not work with are both older 802.3af devices and this thing may have VERY picky PoE negotiation that doesn't like them.<br /><br />When I have a chance to borrow one again, I may try this with a Netgear WAX615 to see if it works and if it recognizes it as 802.3af or 802.3at (as it is essentially designed to only work at full power with 802.3at PoE and tends to be quite conservative with which switches and injectors it recognizes as being compliant).<br /><br />So....yeah, not the greatest luck with this and I really can't recommend it unless you can test it out with your specific device ahead of time.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+g5v-1nhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+g5v-1nhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+g5v-1nhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LEiu1c0-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LEiu1c0-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LEiu1c0-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Xibw8LmEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Xibw8LmEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Xibw8LmEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/810D9OcZRWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/810D9OcZRWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/810D9OcZRWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81anHeGqx-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81anHeGqx-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81anHeGqx-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81f5HlRiYgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81f5HlRiYgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81f5HlRiYgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81yN-xAZkbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81yN-xAZkbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81yN-xAZkbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BZYRBXH6,B0C131713C,AFDCRITLV6WGYKTAJAAMMSPWRTZQ,2023-04-17 08:09:45.779,0,False,502

Cover there is to presumably protect them against sweat.<br /><br />They definitely tried to make the shell small, because cover is relatively thick and makes them notably larger.<br /><br />I don't think the task was fully accomplished, since while my ears are not the smallest, with the cover inears are still on the larger side.<br />Also, with the cover tips do not fit my ears well, so I simply removed the cover.<br /><br />Cable is very microphonic, it's possible to wear them only behind the ear in iem style.<br /><br />Sound.<br /><br />I appreciate how the FR graph looks - first of all it is very, veery, veeery smooth. No peaks, no dips.<br /><br />Highly encourage you to stick to original tips. All the other tips I tried, are adding more peaks on highs.<br /><br />I EQ the sh out of all my headphones with the help of sine sweeps and parametric EQ. I discovered that on any headphone I still hear some very specific peaks and dips, particularly but not exclusively in highs.<br />The sound significantly improves after I EQ those peaks and dips in and out, so the sweep is at the same volume at all frequencies.<br /><br />The good thing about these JBLs is that I do not need to EQ them up to 2.5K!

Basically bass and a large chunk of mids are very well balanced, maybe slightly thick, which is fine.<br /><br />Having such a smooth FR through the entire range is definitely a nice accomplishment and it's easy to EQ.<br /><br />So now I know what things I like about Harman Target and what I don't.

That means it has pretty much equal pickup of sound forward and to the sides, not just a forward and clearer sound as a shotgun mic pattern would have.<br />Testing using my DSLR camera with subject speaking loudly 100 feet (30 meters) away from the camera it had slightly better sound and reduced wind noise than the small microphone built into the camera, but not by much and not louder.<br /><br />The built-in shock mount the seller touts is nothing more than the capsule mounted in a rubber circle attached at the front. If the recording device it is attached to is bumped you will hear the sound. I would suggest to use on a tripod to eliminate camera movement noise.<br />I'm sure the 2 and 1/16 inch (6 cm) long tube really serves no purpose other than looks and to allow for the included ""furry"" windscreen to be attached. I have to say that is probably the only reason I will ever attach the ""7RYMS MinBo"" to my camera again as the windscreen effectively eliminated wind noise that the internal camera mic had trouble with.<br />It would be worth it as an alternative microphone for the reduced wind noise but only ""if"" it was sold for a much lower price.<br />I have to add that to even suggest (as shown in one of the seller's photos), that it would be a suitable addition (replacement mic ?) for a $400+ Tascam Portacapture stereo recorder troubles me.<br /><br />If the seller would just have promoted this as an alternative microphone for the poor small internal mic in your camera (or phone) and priced accordingly, this would be a much different review.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61C9Pz9T-vL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61C9Pz9T-vL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61C9Pz9T-vL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KyW1ntp6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KyW1ntp6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KyW1ntp6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YbxfUFaML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YbxfUFaML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YbxfUFaML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uCB8h-2ML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uCB8h-2ML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uCB8h-2ML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BML155F5,B0BML155F5,AEIW6PLSYCSDGLOJXAAIGAHAWDFA,2023-01-02 20:15:33.111,0,False,502
539842,2,Very Inaccurate Data,"The two main reasons I wanted this watch was to respond to text via speech-to-text as I’ve seen others do with their watches and for the sleep tracking capabilities. I was even delighted to see that I could control the Spotify playing on my phone from it. I quickly realized that I was able to see texts on the watch, but not respond.<br /><br />Which was fine. At least it could track my sleep and a host of other functions. The next day as I sat at a table reading, it recorded me as being asleep for 20 minutes when I most certainly wasn’t. I shook it off as an error. But the last several days it’s only recorder an hour and a half to 4 and a half segments of sleep when it was closer to 5-8 hours.<br /><br />I’ve also since realized that the music control function only works if you keep the watch’s phone app open while playing the music. Even then the watch tries to function as a speaker and I’ll have to redirect the audio to my headphones. In fact, every time the app is open the watch instantly takes over audio even when I’d rather it not.<br /><br />Tail end of my expectations was to use it to track my steps. Again I have sat at a table and had steps added to my count. I get the feeling it tracks steps via gps which can be highly inaccurate. I’ve also read other reviews on the watch’s accuracy for blood pressure and heart rate being poor. I can’t attest to this myself but I would easily believe it.<br /><br />In the end I am keeping it as it does function well enough for the $30 I spent on it. I can see texts to judge when it’s worth taking my phone out while at work. It does display the time and date literally at the flick of the wrist so that’s handy. It takes calls fairly well so long as your wrist isn’t blocking the speaker or receiver and you are in a quiet area. It has built in alarm, timer, and stopwatch functions that I’m sure work well though I haven’t used them yet myself. Lastly it has a ‘Find my Phone’ function that works though I’m not sure how far away it can be and still function.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617rDsTU5jL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617rDsTU5jL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617rDsTU5jL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BGMWYY8L,B0BGMYY12Z,AEXDIEIAYNQ7UU7VHX3KCUXKIVRA,2023-05-08 17:46:05.812,1,True,502

24017,4,Decent KVM,"Let me start by saying I'm picky with KVMs and I have been through a few.  This one is replacing another unit from another manufacturer which has intensely bright indicator lights.<br />This box is very small and compact for supporting 4 USB and 4 computers.  It feels solid with all metal casing.  The buttons are not the best, but do operate well.  The connections in the back are good for tucking away wires and avoiding clutter.  The USB ports are in the front making them accessible.  This works for me because my mouse and keyboard are using a remote dongle.  If you are using a wired mouse/keyboard, be aware the cords will come out of the front.<br />I love that the external power is included but not required.  A different KVM I owned required power to maintain video signal, this one does not.  That is one less cable to clutter my area.<br />The connections to the PCs are made with separate USB-A and HDMI cables.  For me, this was a disappointment because my pre-existing unit had USB-B connector /HDMI combo which won't work with this unit.  I'll need to rerun the wires.  The USB cables are included, which is good.  However, the HDMI cables are not so you'll need to buy them separately if you don't have any laying around.<br />Switching is easy.  You can either use the front panel buttons to select the PC you want or you can use the tethered remote.  There is no keyboard key-combo to switch between PCs.  This was also a disappointment compared to my prior KVM as I must now reach for another device with a wire on my desk to switch.  Also, note that with a MAC I have a slight problem.  Each time I switch back to my mac, it detects a new keyboard and prompts me to press keys to identify the ""new"" keyboard.  The Mac doesn't remember the keyboard when you switch away and back.  You can click through the notice, but it is annoying.<br />I'm happy to say the lights are not that intense.  They are just enough to see the unit has power and which PC is selected.  It won't light a room ;).<br />Compact, easy to use, and durable.  Definitely a good purchase that would be better with MAC compatibility and keyboard switching.",[],B0BVLNC1F8,B0C694XQJ4,AF3FZM34VQDASKF34UOIUOIHTHSA,2023-03-07 17:52:15.041,0,False,502
301096,5,Lowers analog volume nicely without messing with the sound,"I like this thing. I wanted an analog volume control knob on my desk that wasn't going to wreck the sound and that's what I got.<br /><br />It's just a 50K pot on a board with two 3.5mm jacks which is exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />The pot is detented with 50 clicks. I wish it was smooth instead but it's pretty cheap so the notches probably help hide any roughness.<br /><br />The pot's shaft is a 6mm diameter split shaft that protrudes a good 0.5in (12.7mm) so just about any aftermarket knob will work.<br /><br />The stock knob is an aluminum shell with a plastic insert, not solid aluminum. It doesn't feel good with the stock knob and is too lightweight to stay put very well even with the included silicone grip tape.<br /><br />I changed the knob for a 44mm diameter solid aluminum knob and it feels so much better. The extra weight helps keep it in place and smooths out the pot's actuation. 44mm is close but still slightly smaller than the original knob so if you want a flush fit you want ~48mm diameter knob.<br /><br />My setup is PC headphone jack --> Nobsound volume control --> Tin T3 Plus IEMs at 32ohms.<br /><br />The front panel audio header that goes to the headphone jack I'm using runs through some kind of op-amps. The motherboard is a Gigabyte ab350-m d3sh and I have no clue how much power it's putting out but it's more than line level and sounds clearer.<br /><br />I tested it at the Nobsound's max volume (where the resistance should be 0 ohms) with my normal Windows volume settings and couldn't tell any difference compared to the IEMs plugged straight in to the same headphone jack.<br /><br />Things still sound good as the volume comes down (and resistance increases) but get warmer I think. That could also be placebo. There is some channel imbalance when you raise the volume quickly but it seems to even out after you stop turning the knob. Still no audible noise in my setup as the volume comes down.<br /><br />With Windows' volume turned to 100, I stay in the upper quarter of the range and have about 6 clicks I jump around in.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/516cIADG2TL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/516cIADG2TL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/516cIADG2TL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ok10P14aL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ok10P14aL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ok10P14aL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6163F5GfotL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6163F5GfotL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6163F5GfotL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616WNf7+p0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616WNf7+p0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616WNf7+p0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617WfVH8f2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617WfVH8f2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617WfVH8f2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61I3TD25wbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61I3TD25wbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61I3TD25wbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZOKDMwPhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZOKDMwPhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZOKDMwPhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HDL+ErJ4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HDL+ErJ4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HDL+ErJ4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BJVJYLLP,B0BJVJYLLP,AGHPUMAR7I4KFJCKKDK6NDX3GKPA,2023-03-20 01:46:01.727,2,True,502

At the bottom of the microphone is an RGB lighting ring, there are 6 different lighting effects (or you can turn off the lights), some of which are variations of the same effect at a different speed. You cannot control the color of the effects, but the inclusion is cool and requires no software to run. The microphone is made of some sort of alloy with the controls being on a plastic extrusion. The built-in pop filter works very well, but the orange color may be off-putting to some.<br /><br />The built-in voice effects are very cool and are fun to mess around with in calls. The noise reduction does not do much in my case, My computer fans are not picked up normally by the microphone, and even with the reduction on my keyboard and mouse are audible. The knob on the microphone will control the levels for the microphone, headphones, or echo effect depending on what color the MVE button is on. The knob has sharp indents that make using it easy and satisfying. Pushing the knob in will switch the mic from cardioid to omnidirectional with the RGB ring communicating what mode it’s in by changing color. Muting the mic will leave the RGB ring permanently red regardless of whether or not you left the ring on.<br /><br />The microphone sounds alright and looks good, I have another microphone that sounds better, but looks unassuming and lacks features (at the same price point).

This is with no cover on the lens at all, it is a bright sunny day what we'll do now is switch over to the 2-32 ND filter. As you can see immediately at the 2 the colors look better. Now I'm adjusting this to the 32. I did not adjust anything on the camera. No f-stop or ISO changes, just twisting the adjustable ND filter. You can easily see the difference from the bright sunny day, then from the 2 to the 32. Next, we will swap on the 32-512.

It is a dazzling display of color, clarity, light and nature like I have never seen before.<br /><br />I purchased these binoculars to take with me when I go wildlife watching. My favorite part of observing wildlife is sitting in a peaceful forest and observing the animals around me. These binoculars keep me entertained throughout the day and allow me to get up close and personal with the animals and Mother Nature. I am not an optics expert, but these binoculars provide very clear and sharp images that allow me to easily focus on things like birds and deer and see these objects in great detail from 300 yards away.<br /><br />I'm nearsighted and wear glasses. I can use these binoculars with my glasses on and with my glasses off. With glasses on, simply turning the adjustment of the rear eyecup clockwise provides a nice wide field of view. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could also use these binoculars with my glasses off. I simply adjust the rear eyecup counterclockwise and then adjust the center focal length to compensate for my poor vision with my glasses off. I was able to clearly see 300-400 yards away without my glasses, just using these binoculars!<br /><br />I also tried the included phone adapter that comes with the binoculars on my Samsung Ultra S21 phone. It was easy to set up and user friendly. To get a rectangular image, I just set the phone's zoom to 2x. I've attached photos with these settings in the comments. I'm sure I could have mounted it on a tripod with binoculars that include a tripod mount and it would have been much clearer.<br /><br />Great value for the money!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BuFNABO2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BuFNABO2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BuFNABO2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61f-FPyMJFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61f-FPyMJFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61f-FPyMJFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BVMWxvTwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BVMWxvTwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BVMWxvTwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71E+LNEdDPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71E+LNEdDPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71E+LNEdDPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BKY5139T,B0CFL9YM5D,AGU7RYQG2XZI7VHOEJN5KBJUV7TA,2023-02-16 07:07:34.085,2,True,502
777847,4,People Can See My Clutter. Field of View is Too Wide.,"As other earlier reviews mentioned, that this j5create 1080P HD Webcam is great quality. Even in dim lighting, the video quality is excellent.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- The way it firmly holds on to my monitor is impressive.<br /><br />- Additionally, the cable is long enough so that I can run it beneath my desk without using an extension.<br /><br />- Both the manual focus and the auto focus are excellent.<br /><br />- The microphone works very well.<br /><br />- Another nice touch is the privacy shutter.<br /><br />- When I plugged it into my computer's USB port, it recognized it right away.<br /><br />- It's also convenient that you can flip the camera down to examine a document; you can eliminate the need to flip the page over by just pushing and holding the red button for a few seconds.<br /><br />CONS<br />- However, the field of view, though, is just too wide for me. Too much of my office is visible. I've spent a lot of time arranging my bookshelves behind me to be meeting-ready. However, this camera captures a lot more of my office than I want to show. Even at the 4 x 3 setting the cam angle is still much too wide.<br /><br />Bottom Line(s)<br />This camera, in my opinion, would be excellent for an office meeting when several individuals needed to be recorded. It would also be great when the family wishes to connect with grandma and grandpa online. The whole family can enter the frame.<br /><br />However, while I'm sitting in my chair doing a one-on-one meeting, this webcam has a way too wide a field of view and reveals all my clutter.<br /><br />I'm aware that most web conferencing software has a backdrop blur function, however unless you have a green screen, the blur doesn't seem particularly professional. And, because I don't have a green screen behind me, I won't be using this camera at my home office until I do.<br /><br />To be clear, this is not a camera fault. I'm sure it was designed with such a wide field of view in mind. I only wish the field of view was mentioned in the product description.",[],B0BP1CK4SM,B0BP1CK4SM,AFHOTX5VO6F7TFTDWQ6QRK6RWJ3Q,2023-02-09 23:24:47.072,0,False,501
738389,3,Supports Samsung Super Fast Charging,"In order to charge my phone in my neoprene phone pouch (sized to fit both my Samsung Galaxy 22+ phone and my Anker Powercore Slim 10000 PD) I wanted to have a cable that would support the Samsung Fast Charging (but not Super Fast Charging) that this external battery supports.<br />Eventually some company will make a similar, phone-size/phone-shape slim charger that supports Samsung Super Fast Charging, but we're not there yet.<br />So as to fit neatly in the phone pouch, I wanted a cable with right-angle USB-C male plugs on both ends.<br />I found three here on amazon, but couldn't figured which would be best. So I ordered all three to do some comparison testing to report for all three cables.<br />Here are the three I bought, with my analysis of each.<br />zdyCGTTime: The cable is short (~20 cm/7"" between the centers of the two plugs). The cable itself is thick and stiff and doesn't bend well. When plugged into a wall charger that supports Samsung Super Fast Charging, the cable also supports it. However, I found that the USB-C male plug would lose the connection with my phone when it was jiggled so I discarded this as an option.<br />AAOTOKK: this superficially looks similar to the zdyCGTTime cable, but longer (~32 cm/12.5"" between the centers of the two plugs). Like the zdyCGTTime, the cable is thick and stiff and supports Super Fast Charging. Unlike that zdyCGTTime, the plug fits securely in the phone's USB-C socket and no amount of wiggling causes it to lose contact. It supports Samsung Super Fast Charging, and even if the longer cable is heavier and bulkier, the length allows it to lie next to the phone/external battery so fits better into the pouch. If my external battery supported Super Fast Charging this would be my choice.<br />KOOWOD: like the AAOTOKK, this cable is longer, but the cable is thinner, lighter and much more flexible, bends easily and sits happily in my phone pouch next to my phone and external batter. It does NOT support Samsung Super Fast Charging, though it does support Samsung Fast Charging. But since my external battery only supports Fast Charging, I am using this cable.",[],B08CY32TRR,B08CY32W6X,AE37TSO66UVAW55ORP7WW2JFQWVA,2023-02-22 12:52:45.748,0,True,501
938936,4,"Convenient, strong magnetic coupling","Being a fan of Apple's MagSafe connector, I grabbed these in the hope of finding some good applications around the house.  Gadgets are increasingly powered by USB chargers these days, and the ports can often be fiddly to hookup if done in a dark or in a hard to see location.<br /><br />So far I'm having success in only a couple limited scenarios.  The port adapters are 8mm in diameter, and 3mm thick on the back of the USB male piece.  My iPad Pro is 6mm in thickness, and if it weren't for the low-profile case I'm using, the adapter would stick out 1mm beyond the front and back surfaces.  Certain device cases may not allow you to fit the adapter so that the USB connector can fully slide into the port.  Thankfully, it works for my iPad, but it doesn't work well on my iPhone since the case has an attached waterproof port cover.<br /><br />The only other device I've found around my house where it's a good match is a USB desk fan.  Note, you can't pass data using this cable and because of the small size of the adapter you probably won't want to be constantly taking it in and out.  Therefore, it limits the utility quite a bit depending on your stable of devices.<br /><br />Other observations:<br />- The magnetic cables clip on and off pretty easily.  The magnets are strong for their size, so good win.<br />- The pack comes with 3 plastic organizers that clip onto cables to hold the adapters.  These are fiddly to load adapters into, and the cable magnets are not quite strong enough to reliably pull them out.  This is useless to me, and they will go in the garbage.<br />- Because the port connectors are quite small, you may find that it's challenging to pry them out of ports once seated.  I had to use a letter opener to get one out, but it might've required pliers in a less accessible scenario.  It's best to leave the adapters in devices where you plan to always use these cables.<br />- The cables are pliable and the braided jackets are nice.  Lots of length options, so nice for the gadgets where you might use them.<br />- The max charge rate is pretty low, so don't expect to quickly fill those modern USB-C devices.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ItEYsM5aL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ItEYsM5aL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ItEYsM5aL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Pnp2roytL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Pnp2roytL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Pnp2roytL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81LTBlqelVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81LTBlqelVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81LTBlqelVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BNH97NYF,B0C4F49CWX,AFH4DCFZPPBBRXP3UYJFYOZEY4CA,2023-02-11 20:46:29.552,2,False,501
471129,3,Very Heavy; some nice details,"Was very curious if and how a “multi-model” case would fit. - Used this on an 2020 iPad Air, 4th Gen (A2316). Item came in a very fancy box with all whistles and bells, way too much for a simple keyboard.<br /><br />* FIT *:<br />- all cutouts fit the iPad well; some strange little extra lip on one of the speakers, each side, but not dramatic enough to obstruct<br />- TPC is soft and very heavy, back has extra honeycomb layer for support? and/or air flow; iPad was easily to place into the case but seemed to fit solidly<br />- The PENCIL fits well; holder is on the wrong side,  it will not be charged w the Air/Pro magnetic charger; nevertheless a grove on the magnetic charge holds the pencil well, and lets it charge<br />- The keyboard sits loosely on one side of the cover; to use it, one will always have to take it off its magnet and move the keyboard in order for the iPad to stand up in the case’ provided grooves.<br /><br />* KEYBOARD *:<br />- The keyboard is light and ha all the function keys needed - it is covered with a very thin silicone skin, I assume to protect keys from spillage - I liked it a lot and kept it on the keyboard while typing. It softens the keystrokes a little, which I like.<br />- The magnetic bond to the iPad case is a little weak, and it slipped a couple of times.<br />- I did not encounter any Bluetooth (dis)connection issues during the time I used it.<br />- At the time I cannot speak to the battery life; the charging is via Micro-USB, a cable only is provided.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />OK fit, seems to work for multi-format; good keyboard but weak magnetic mount.  The final negative is the weight, it is over 675g, heavier than the iPads it is to augment.

450883,4,"Ideal for data recovery, less so for long-term home use","[[VIDEOID:d4aa162c7e7b059e3d0e9be2a0423526]] SETMSPACE offers an affordable casing for your wayward SSD or HDD. It's very straightforwards - there's no gimmicks or doohickys or readouts, whether you like those or not. One port, for power and data, a black casing, that's it. Oh, and these little felt sticky pads which, I think are meant to cushion the inside? but I'm not sure as no instruction's given for them. They don't belong on the outside.<br /><br />If you're running an SSD this should fill your needs nicely. They've no spinning platters inside so they're a teensie bit less fragile and they make for totally silent running. There's no indicator light so you won't know it's plugged in until your computer tells you; this can be an extra step for troubleshooting but for the most part shouldn't be.<br /><br />What I like best about it: It opens easily and drives pop in and out without difficulty. Some external cases are very reluctant to give up their drives, or aren't ever meant to. I don't like those, it makes them impractical in the long term and especially for data recovery. This is perfect for data recovery because of how compact and easy it is; the (short) cable length and light case means you could carry it empty in a small computer tool kit if that's your job (like what I'm aiming for!). USB ubiquity also helps this, and it works on OpenSUSE Linux too (tested with version 15.4).<br /><br />But its strengths are also its weaknesses. The cable length (you can see in my photo, it's like as long as my thigh?) means, it's not going very far. The casing likely won't open by accident (not designed that way) but it didn't impress me with how durable it 'sounded'. Not terribly thick, closer to frangible plastic rather than something that can absorb shock or bounce it away or whatevers. For data rescue this isn't as much a problem, as drives it host, it only hosts temporarily. But for long term storage, I'd want something with better durability and maybe better cooling too - plastic isn't going to help much there and there's no room for a drive to breath inside.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611N9dOYjhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611N9dOYjhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611N9dOYjhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614noROpwyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614noROpwyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614noROpwyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61c-VvY8yFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61c-VvY8yFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61c-VvY8yFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hQnQsHb8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hQnQsHb8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hQnQsHb8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ksO1xIx0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ksO1xIx0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ksO1xIx0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uZFt1A4nL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uZFt1A4nL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uZFt1A4nL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BPXSBMDB,B0C1JNDRW9,AGSOEDVV3U5DDAYDKFKLZLQV5GGQ,2023-03-20 15:36:07.128,0,False,501
996168,5,Strong duster that functions better than any compressed air can,"To clean out my handheld Shark vacuum, I purchased this. I take remove the filter from my hand vacuum and clean it every time I clean the dirt trap (or catch chamber, as you can refer to the area where all the dirt is collected). This procedure helps the vacuum last longer. I had been using compressed air cans, and they were great. But I went through a lot of them, and I wasn't happy about the ongoing expense and damaging consequences on the environment. I researched a ton of reviews for several compressed air dusters before choosing this one. I put it in with my saved for later items til I could afford it, and then it came up with a deal on the price (think it was one of those ""Lightning Deals"" but can't remember for sure), and so I bought it. I'm glad i did cuz i really like it. I love that its chargable and doesn't have to be plugged in. It's pretty powerful... maybe about 85% of what the compressed air cans can acheive. I use this everytime i clean out the vac and filter, and then i keep one can of compressed air around to do a deeper clean about every tenth time or so. Now one can of compressed air will last probably a good 6 months, instead of a week or 2. The charge lasts a good length of time cuz I haven't even had to recharge it yet and I've used it about 7 or 8 times so far. I use this every time I clean the vacuum and filter, and I also keep a can of pressurized air nearby to use every tenth or so to conduct a deeper clean. Today, instead of lasting a week or two, a can of compressed air will likely last a good six months. I've used it around seven or eight times so far and haven't even needed to recharge it, proving that the charge lasts for quite some time. Apart than not having quite as much power as the cans, the only negative aspect is how loud it is. I live in an apartment complex, and I won't use it in the early morning or late at night since it's simply too upsetting. Yet since it doesn't bother me in the middle of the day, I do it. Overall, I'm very happy I acquired it. In the long term, it will cost me less money and have a less environmental impact. Oh, and it works great for drying stuff as well.

705160,5,Worked great on my RV,"I ordered this on a weekend. Then I called Waveform tech support on Monday. Tech Support was very helpful. I was told that this antenna mount was actually made for the eve of a home. But I elected to use it on my motorhome. I mounted the antenna right behind my AC unit so it was shielded from wind as I drive. I did use a bungee cord as a secondary hold down to measure for safety. Because of the panel design, the antenna will pick up a wide range of directionality yet because it’s not Omni directional it will increase signal to noise ratio by eliminating noise from the 180° direction  behind the antenna. I told Tech Support that I had two primary goals. The first goal was to receive cell signals when camping rurally in my RV when cell signals were not very strong and bandwidth was poor. I was currently in Senator Wash Az, about 60 miles south of Quartzsite Az. My second goal was to be able to drive and utilize the antenna if needed. Tech Support said the driving factor would be best served by an Omni directional antenna, but the first goal would not be served well by the Omni directional antenna due to no gain factor. The flat panel antenna increases signal to noise ratio and this gives a gain which improves cell signal and bandwidth. So when I received the antenna, before actually mounting it to the roof I mocked up the installation temporarily and did some testing. The panel antenna did improve my signal and bandwidth. I used Speedtest by Ookla to make comparisons. My AT&T MR 1100 Netgear hotspot tested at about 25 Mb per second download speed with no antenna attached. With the Waveform panel antenna attached and pointed in the correct direction. My bandwidth went up to 49 Mb per second. Quite an improvement out in the boonies. As a second test, I wanted to see if I can drive with the antenna down and still receive a decent signal. So I lowered the antenna mast with the panel pointing straight upward from the roof. I thought this upward direction might receive a signal omni-directionally. I then used SpeedTest again and still had 25mbps. That’s doable for me. With 80 to 85% of my driving being on highways and in town, my bandwidth should be much greater most of the time. And when rural, I should still have an OK signal while driving most of the time. I highly recommend Waveform for their excellent products and Tech Support.",[],B09QB1YWPY,B09LP5TFJR,AFQKDKWO2V3S4Y2FYBTFIVK3G6DA,2023-03-26 18:48:05.417,2,True,501

I had a Microsoft keyboard many many years ago and it was stolen. I’ve been salty ever since. I paid triple the cost for that than I paid for this particular one.<br /><br />First, let’s talk about the low profile keys. They make typing so smooth and effortless. I love it.<br /><br />Secondly, the connection is awesome. I have not had any delays. I type about 65-70 wpm and my old keyboard was slow and laggy. I would often times get frustrated because I would have to go back and correct my words because it couldn’t keep up. Nope no longer have this issue. Love it!!<br /><br />Thirdly, the trackball. Wow! I have never used a track ball before and prior to ordering I kept comparing it to the mouse pad on a laptop. Which I absolutely hate so I always had a mouse to hook up to the laptop or tablets. I just figured i would continue to use a standard mouse if I didn’t like it.  The first day it was very ackward and I found myself reaching for the mouse. The second day I decided to put my mouse away and forced myself to try the trackball and finally figured out the best technique is to use my left hand for the button and my right hand on the ball. Ummmmm yea I now know I never ever want to go back to using a standard mouse. Oh yea and the biggest issue I had which I saw in other reviews was the speed and that was easy to correct by turning the pointer speed way down which made my life so much easier.  Love it!!<br /><br />Lastly, the design. The slight curve it has in the middle. I wish it had more of a higher curve but that’s okay. Love it.<br /><br />I’ll end this review for now. If anything changes I will update the review. As for now I am so in love with this keyboard. If your on the fence about it I say don’t wait any longer just buy it. What do you have to lose??  You can always return it.

I told Tech Support that I had two primary goals. The first goal was to receive cell signals when camping rurally in my RV when cell signals were not very strong and bandwidth was poor. I was currently in Senator Wash Az, about 60 miles south of Quartzsite Az. My second goal was to be able to drive and utilize the antenna if needed. Tech Support said the driving factor would be best served by an Omni directional antenna, but the first goal would not be served well by the Omni directional antenna due to no gain factor. The flat panel antenna increases signal to noise ratio and this gives a gain which improves cell signal and bandwidth. So when I received the antenna, before actually mounting it to the roof I mocked up the installation temporarily and did some testing. The panel antenna did improve my signal and bandwidth. I used Speedtest by Ookla to make comparisons. My AT&T MR 1100 Netgear hotspot tested at about 25 Mb per second download speed with no antenna attached. With the Waveform panel antenna attached and pointed in the correct direction. My bandwidth went up to 49 Mb per second. Quite an improvement out in the boonies. As a second test, I wanted to see if I can drive with the antenna down and still receive a decent signal. So I lowered the antenna mast with the panel pointing straight upward from the roof. I thought this upward direction might receive a signal omni-directionally. I then used SpeedTest again and still had 25mbps. That’s doable for me. With 80 to 85% of my driving being on highways and in town, my bandwidth should be much greater most of the time. And when rural, I should still have an OK signal while driving most of the time. I highly recommend Waveform for their excellent products and Tech Support.",[],B09QB1YWPY,B09LP5TFJR,AFQKDKWO2V3S4Y2FYBTFIVK3G6DA,2023-03-26 18:48:05.417,2,True,501

958175,5,Incredible sound for a mini portable - Excellent reception,"ZWS-700<br />I am an avid SWL and ham radio operator, and own multiple, high dollar, receivers. This thing holds its own against my Eton Executive portable for sensitivity and it is much better in sound quality. The first few hours I was using this I had to keep looking over at it, the 700’s sound seemed like it should be coming out of a much larger radio. A super feature on the audio is that they reduced annoying static (via digital processing) to mostly a soft hiss, all the while maintaining great audio fidelity.<br /><br />Good points:<br />- Easily understandable, low noise sound, even on weak AM stations. That would be from good good DSP audio processing.<br />- Uses a low cost BL-5C type rechargeable battery. You can obtain spares for around $5 each. If you are concerned with battery life, keep a ‘charged up’ spare handy.<br />- I like that you can lay it flat on its back or sides without worrying about accidentally changing any settings.<br />- The antenna is only 11 inches tall but performs as well on FM and Weather Band as my portables with 20 inch+ antennas.<br />- For the SW bands, an external wire antenna is a must in most cases. This little kit has included an external, clip on, wire antenna.<br />- USB type-C charging port. No need to worry about accidentally breaking something by inserting the charging cable in upside down.<br />- If you need to switch out a battery, the memories will stay in tact.<br />- ‘Power on’ starts with your last frequency selection.<br /><br />Points to consider:<br />- The ZWS-700 can do an ‘auto scan’ and fill its limited number of memory banks. There is no way (that I have found) to manually add or remove a frequency from those banks.<br />- The ‘analog’ tuning dial works well on AM and FM broadcast bands, on SW you can hear a slight audio shift as it switches through the channels.<br />- The controls are rather small, it is a tiny radio after all.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />I was worried about spending too much money on a radio this small. I do now love this thing  :)<br /><br />Enjoy",[],B09SSYZYZC,B0BH8PTYGR,AEQ4XXSZ4AHG4RQDIR74QRL5HEVQ,2023-01-01 15:20:19.254,0,True,501
78672,5,Another great gimbal from DJI,"The DJI RS3 Mini is pretty self-explanatory - it's a much smaller version of the RS3. I have been using the RS3 for a while and coming from another brand, DJI's smoothing algorithms are definitely part of the reason why they are a market leader in the gimbal space.<br /><br />Size:<br />Compared to the RS3, this is a lot smaller, and it's nice and light. The handle is much smaller, and is definitely only big enough for one hand. Similar to the RS3, it brings over the small touch screen, joystick, mode button, and record button. There is no mode selector slider on this one though, and the scroll wheel is positioned a bit differently, and doesn't feel quite as nice.<br /><br />Features:<br />On the left side of the gimbal, you get one single NATO rail to attach accessories. I tried out a smallrig handle that I use on the RS3, and it worked fine, but I wish that you got two nato rails instead of just one. Unlike the full size RS3, you only get one USB C port on the camera arm, instead of the three. You won't be using the focus puller on this tiny gimbal anyway, so that's not a huge deal. I like to use my cameras wired into the gimbal, and that's no problem with my R6.<br /><br />Weight:<br />For payload, the RS3 mini has a massive 4.4lb capability, which is enough for a lot of camera options. I've used it with my gopro and my friend used it with his sony mirrorless and it works great! As for the weight of the assembly, it's significantly lighter than its bigger brother. See pictures for weight comparison<br /><br />There are a couple of other things it's missing, such as the removable battery to dismount for travel, but it's pretty small as is, so not a huge deal. It's also missing the auto-lock and unlock, but that's just a convenience thing, and it still has locks, which is something I'd consider a necessity nowadays.<br /><br />If you're looking for a high-quality gimbal coming in at low weight, with high load, and high-quality materials, this is a great option.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711eX7ZYphL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711eX7ZYphL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711eX7ZYphL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WEqZIq8uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WEqZIq8uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WEqZIq8uL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fU5u5-6cL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fU5u5-6cL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fU5u5-6cL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tg7HIVbyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tg7HIVbyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tg7HIVbyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vQIEKHcFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vQIEKHcFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vQIEKHcFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81K3TGyiGiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81K3TGyiGiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81K3TGyiGiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BLD1KBHQ,B0BS1764N5,AHVPYCRHWOIVME43YYPSBSTZ5DDQ,2023-03-20 00:21:49.999,0,False,501
778633,5,Excellent Wireless CarPlay Device!,"This is an excellent device if you are seeking to add wireless (or wired) CarPlay. It also works with Android Auto, but this is installed in my wife's vehicle so I haven't tried using it for that yet. I'm going to break down the pros and cons below:<br /><br />Pros<br />1) Excellent sound quality using Aux port and FM transmitter<br />2) Bright display that can be dimmed for night driving<br />3) Extremely easy to use<br />4) Excellent suction mount with an easy install (under 15 minutes to get paired up and everything working properly)<br />5) When using the FM transmitter, the device has excellent call quality<br />6) The device powers up immediately and reconnects to the phone with no issues<br /><br />Cons<br />1) The included mic is terrible, but the one built in the device is fantastic when using FM<br />2) FM transmission does require there to be open channels near your location which can be an issue in more urban areas<br />3) The swiping detection is a little slow<br />4) The power supply includes two USB ports to plug in other cords, but I would have liked to see a USB-c port instead of two regular USB ports<br />5) If your car does not turn off power to your 9v when you turn it off, you will have to unplug it every time. Thankfully my wife's car does turn off, so it wasn't an issue.<br /><br />This is an excellent device with just some minor flaws that do not warrant removing 1 star in my opinion. I would have given this device 9/10 for these few flaws. If we lived somewhere difficult to use the FM transmitter, it would be 4/5 stars.<br /><br />I would also like to add that it would be awesome if the manufacturer created a model of this device that included a dash camera so that it could be multipurpose.<br /><br />If you are looking to update a vehicle with a wireless CarPlay experience, this is the way to go! We contemplated putting in the new stereo system, but this is a much cheaper option! It is definitely better if the car has an aux port or you live in an area with a few open FM stations, so make sure you can do one or the other before purchasing.",[],B0BMNW8Y18,B0BMNW8Y18,AGOSWG7KSIY7YI2Q7Z24R32ZTZ6Q,2023-03-28 18:17:42.946,2,True,501
143877,4,A very comfortable & secure headset for jogging & or cycling!,"So, let me start by saying that if you're buying this headset mostly for its sound purity, quality and or loudness, then you may want to look elsewhere.  But if you're into outdoor sports (jogging, cycling, swimming, etc.) then this is surely worth considering.  I use mine mostly when I go jogging as it's very light, secure and comfortable to wear with decent sound and still able to hear the background traffic. I've even paired it to my tv so that I can watch a show without waking up my wife & so that's another plus.<br /><br />That said, let's start with sound quality which is very good but not great.  It does have a HiFi stereo surround sound with decent bass but you can't control the amount of bass/treble or at least I couldn't figure it out. it can't also get too loud but then again no open-ear set will sound like an ear bud so you can't hold this against it either.<br /><br />As far as control goes, this really has some getting used to.  The small buttons aren't that easy to distinguish from each other so at first I often pressed the wrong ones but now I'm getting a little better at it and besides I learned not to mess with it too much but when you still have to press the button to answer a call.<br /><br />Battery life is probably one of the best feature on this headset.  In the short time that I've had this, I only charged it once and I have yet to recharge it again but then again, I'm not sure  how much charge is left on it as it doesn't have an indicator to tell you anything about the strength of the battery.<br /><br />As far as features, this headset comes with everything you may want in a bone-conductor type headset, starting with a good sound, sturdy (quality) frame, water-proof design, HiFi stereo, great battery life with noise reduction among others.  One other cool feature is an inclusion of a 32 GB storage built-into the headset which you can load up with music and not having to take your phone along with you.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good headset especially for outdoor sports & importantly it doesn't come with a price tag of a Shokz headset but it comes with features that's important at this price-point.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41FKVJgC6zL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41FKVJgC6zL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41FKVJgC6zL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41GjMu-F23L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41GjMu-F23L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41GjMu-F23L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41np8o4LGqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41np8o4LGqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41np8o4LGqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51+MO7lFtsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51+MO7lFtsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51+MO7lFtsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BS93LJ8X,B0BS8RPM5D,AE7JYVR4L3SUJPFYPSICK32KADQA,2023-03-09 02:44:50.892,0,False,501
93337,5,Made him the popular brother in the house. And so many prints everywhere !,"This little camera has been the biggest hit amongst all of our kids. The fact that it prints as soon as you take the picture, and so quickly makes it a blast!  We have literally hundreds of pictures all over the house right now of absolutely everything.  The camera comes with 3 rolls of paper, each seems to get about 75 pictures I think it is?<br />The thing here is that the camera has ""achievements "" that you need to watch out for.  You get awards (nothing physical, just on the camera) for 20, 50,100 etc pictures taken so...that uses paper quickly if they're watching that.<br />The picture quality can actual vary.  As seen in my first, peace tea pic, I took a picture using grayscale printing and another using dot printing.  Dot seems overall much clearer and is our new default for any pictures.<br />The dog pic, id taken a pic that printed, then printed the same picture from the memory card. Memory card print semes.to have printed just a tad more blurry than the instant pic.  Not sure why this would be but the results are pictured here.<br />Easy to load with paper,and I grabbed some small credit card machine thermal receipt paper that we will try in it once he gets back from his other parent's place.  I figure we may have to reroll some of it as it may be a bit too thick of a roll but not an issue.  Width side SEEMS that it should be correct. I will try to update once we try the rubber casing on this one covers the charging port just a little as well as memory card slot.  Slot isn't bad but the charging port is a bit annoying.<br />Sleeve stays on well but is removable as well if needed. Silicone I believe so holds shape and should be relatively durable.<br />Image quality on a computer varies a lot by light.  A good, well lit image actually looks pretty decent on a 15"" laptop screen running at a 4k resolution. Lower light or too bright not so good.  Low light gets grainy fast and too bright oversaturates as well.<br />But it's a kids camera.  A cheap, instant print camera.  And it's hard NOT to recommend with the experiences we've already had with it.  Even if never replacing the paper, but that really IS a huge part of the fun.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610y3R9B8ML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610y3R9B8ML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610y3R9B8ML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TgILIr1KL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TgILIr1KL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TgILIr1KL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61w7VyJqvpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61w7VyJqvpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61w7VyJqvpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SQYnBtxOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SQYnBtxOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SQYnBtxOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZcbKcoTjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZcbKcoTjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZcbKcoTjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09XQPVFT6,B0BS38FMPH,AESTEET5QBGO2HUC7GABFIDYFCWA,2023-03-23 18:12:11.607,1,False,501

It is a tight-woven nylon.  Most pockets have rain-covered zippers.<br />With the exception of the small front one and the back one, all are lined with a tan liner so you can see inside to find your stuff.<br />This pack has a mirid of compartments -<br />- Main PC pocket is divided with a strap for the laptop and about 3"" of additional depth.  Ther is a hidden zipper pocket inside.<br />- 2nd pocket includes a small divided zipper space for cash and thumb drives and such. There is a bright orange 8"" strap for your keys with a metal clip.<br />- 3rd pocket is on the outside and about 8x10"" with the 4th below it on the outside about 8x5""<br />- the 5th is an on-the-back document pocket - so no one can open and steal your travel docs while you are in line.<br />Straps are padded with vented facing.  The adjusters have a double-lock, to prevent the straps from sliding when the pack is well loaded.<br />The chest strap is adjustable, sliding up and down. Ther are side straps to tension the main compartment for less-than full loads. There are a pair of straps on the bottom for an umbrella or a mono/tripod. 2 Water bottle pockets on the sides.<br />I unloaded my ""normal"" 15"" laptop bag and moved the contents over. That's 2 HP thin laptops, 2 Amazon 10"" tablets, power supplies, USB chargers and cables, misc. ""Stuff"". All fit except the neoprene sleeve that the HP's usually call home.  This bag is a bit narrower, but not by much. Overall, it works well.  I'll use it loaded for a week or so prior to my trip to break it in and see how the straps adjust to my shoulders.<br />The only real drawbacks I see is that the 2nd outside pocket does not have a rain shield and the grab handle on the top is not up to par for this bag.

893023,3,Blends with Decor,"This is review of Amcrest 4mp Wifi Camera Indoor.  Included in the box is the PTZ camera, power adapter/charger, charger cable, mounting clip, mounting screws, and instructions.  Nice to have power adapter included, as most only include a cable.  The camera unit is egg-shaped and is made for sitting on a flat surface (ie. table, shelf, etc.), the included mounting clip provides option to mount unit on the ceiling.  The white and black colored unit sort of blends-in with my decor, so it makes the unit less noticeable.  The unit works on 2.4GHz wifi only.  The unit also has a slot for a micro-SD card for video storage (256gb max.), I used a 128gb card with no issues.  There is also the option to pay for a cloud service for video storage.  Followed instructions to setup the camera; downloaded the Amcrest Smart Home App to my smartphone and opened an email account (free) to get it started and followed the App instructions to get it operational.  I also had the Amcrest Viewpro App on my phone already, since I own numerous other Amcrest cameras.  Adding a device through that Ap did not work as smoothly as the Smart Home App.  The QR code scanned from the device needed to have some characters of the serial number deleted in order for the Viewpro App to recognize the character string information.  Features of the unit include human detection and can track the movement of a person.  However, it doesn't outline the person, as I have seen in other cameras, where a tracking square is shown on the tracked subject on the App.  The video quality is good and has nice contrast, little sharper than typical 1080p cameras.  The night vision is average and motion detection worked when person was within 11' of unit.  The two-way audio is good, but there is feedback when I spoke into the smartphone (was about 7' away).  The panning feature of the unit for going left and right was okay, the vertical stuck a little, but got better, as I played with it more.  In regard to value, there are many other PTZ cameras in this price range, so competition is tough.  The lack of an adjustable bracket limits the placement options.  Overall, this unit does what it supposed to do, rated average, 3-stars.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519JUMim6pL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519JUMim6pL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519JUMim6pL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61243vy0x0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61243vy0x0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61243vy0x0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VO55DpmoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VO55DpmoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VO55DpmoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09Z556LVF,B0C3JGB1L7,AFURGL32LP6GZGSTM6WUP2DWF7NA,2023-02-19 07:45:21.396,0,False,501
399275,3,Decent headphones for the price,"To preface this review, like another reviewer before me, I mistakenly thought these were active noise cancelling headphones - they are not.  The only noise cancelling feature they have is the silicone pieces that get shoved into your ear to help block out noise, but even then, I could hear everything going on around me (cars on the street, toilet flushing, talking, etc.).  The main purpose of this purchase for me was for the sound cancelling so I will be returning.<br /><br />As to other functions - music does sound great, I can't fault it there.  Very deep and rich sounds especially for a $30 product.  Voice doesn't sound as great, when I played my Daily Jay from the Calm App it sounded flat which surprised me because music sounds great on these.  I can't speak to the calling features, I haven't had a chance to test them since I'm going to return them.<br /><br />The actual buds don't fit my ears very well, but I have a small head and small ears and have historically had issues with fit with just about every type of wireless ear buds I've purchased.  Left one sits nicely but the right one feels like it's going to fall out, even with the smallest silicone plug.<br /><br />When the buds initially power on and connect to BT the audio is violently loud.  Don't put them in your ears before they connect because you may make a mess in your pants.  I imagine the only reason they do this is so you can hear the power on and connect notice when they're out of your ears but god forbid you lose connection while wearing them and they reconnect immediately after.  Keep a spare pair of underwear on you just in case.<br /><br />The touch features on the actual bud work nicely, I didn't have any issues pausing and replaying music.  The buds and case seem to made of a cheaper plastic, it feels kind of cheap in your hands and I have concerns about if it would make it through an accidental drop on a hard surface, but honestly, for $30 it's understandable and fair.<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for a budget friendly option, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these with the caveat that all you need is to listen to some quality sound.  Don't expect effective active or effective noise cancelling and don't drop it without a case on.",[],B0BHYB79FF,B0BHYDSFCD,AFN3LI4TQBQ5LTGVE6O5RY34CNNA,2023-02-27 15:23:50.580,8,True,501
738349,1,Doesn't work with my phone.,"In order to charge my phone in my neoprene phone pouch (sized to fit both my Samsung Galaxy 22+ phone and my Anker Powercore Slim 10000 PD) I wanted to have a cable that would support the Samsung Fast Charging (but not Super Fast Charging) that this external battery supports.<br />Eventually some company will make a similar, phone-size/phone-shape slim charger that supports Samsung Super Fast Charging, but we're not there yet.<br />So as to fit neatly in the phone pouch, I wanted a cable with right-angle USB-C male plugs on both ends.<br />I found three here on amazon, but couldn't figured which would be best. So I ordered all three to do some comparison testing to report for all three cables.<br />Here are the three I bought, with my analysis of each.<br />zdyCGTTime: The cable is short (~20 cm/7"" between the centers of the two plugs). The cable itself is thick and stiff and doesn't bend well. When plugged into a wall charger that supports Samsung Super Fast Charging, the cable also supports it. However, I found that the USB-C male plug would lose the connection with my phone when it was jiggled so I discarded this as an option.<br />AAOTOKK: this superficially looks similar to the zdyCGTTime cable, but longer (~32 cm/12.5"" between the centers of the two plugs). Like the zdyCGTTime, the cable is thick and stiff and supports Super Fast Charging. Unlike that zdyCGTTime, the plug fits securely in the phone's USB-C socket and no amount of wiggling causes it to lose contact. It supports Samsung Super Fast Charging, and even if the longer cable is heavier and bulkier, the length allows it to lie next to the phone/external battery so fits better into the pouch. If my external battery supported Super Fast Charging this would be my choice.<br />KOOWOD: like the AAOTOKK, this cable is longer, but the cable is thinner, lighter and much more flexible, bends easily and sits happily in my phone pouch next to my phone and external batter. It does NOT support Samsung Super Fast Charging, though it does support Samsung Fast Charging. But since my external battery only supports Fast Charging, I am using this cable.",[],B07SN9DJ5G,B07SQTY6SP,AE37TSO66UVAW55ORP7WW2JFQWVA,2023-02-22 12:50:38.023,0,True,501
894124,5,Was even able to pair it to my android phone,"I would not call it ergonomic because it has the same old design I have had that causes problems with my wrists, but it does work well.  I was pretty surprised that I could even use it with my phone.  It paired very easily and also comes with a USB dongle if you dont have bluetooth.<br /><br />The keys have a positive feel to them even though they are silent to use.<br /><br />The dongle can be stored under the keyboard or the mouse and comes in the mouse with a small piece of tape over it so it doesnt come loose in shipping.  The keyboard does have little legs on the back to help raise it up a bit.<br /><br />The keyboard is not entirely laid out like PC keyboards  in that some keys, like page up and page down are located in different spots than you may be used to (like next to the enter key instead of the number pad) but I dont know if that is a pro or a con yet.<br /><br />Weight wise, it is similar to other wireless keyboards that I have and use.  For touch typist, there are reference bumps on the F and J keys to help find your positions.<br /><br />A few oddities that I have noticed.  On most keyboards, the 'shift' keys are usually shown with the 'shifted' symbol above the unshifted symbol.  Like '&lt;' is over the ','.  Most of the keys on this keyboard are like that... but not all of them.  For example, on this keyboard there is a key with this '[{'.  The shifted symbol '{' is to the right of the unshifted symbol '[', which is a little bit confusing when you look at it.  It works just like a normal keyboard, but it is not as obvious when something needs to be shifted or not.  Here are the keys like that:<br />  ,&lt;<br />  .><br />  /?<br />  [{<br />  ]}<br /><br />Its a little weird that the rest of the keys are printed like you would expect.<br /><br />One other thing to note is that there are some grey keys with white lettering on them, like the tab key.  It can be hard to read those keys in dim lighting.",[],B0BG84KW83,B0BG864CR9,AGKDJ6WOBGHYU6JCE4GARKCOENHQ,2023-02-23 20:19:56.152,0,False,501
858383,5,Neewer overkill is better than uncertainty of other choices,"We're in a weird space here... Neewer is really making a name for themselves, putting out products that punch above their weight, for a price that is not as high as the old industry names. But that price IS somewhat higher than a lot of off brand companies they tend to end up on lists with.<br />So for something like this desk mount, I see it as: Do you go for the somewhat overkill that Neewer provides for this specific product case, or do you press your luck amongst the lower level, uncertain products that are out there in order to save a few bucks.<br />For me, in this case, I think ponying up is the better choice considering that whatever you mount on this arm is probably expensive, fragile, or most likely both. I just don't want to waste the time finding out by playing with a different product.<br />Specifically, Neewer offers you a super solid pole made of strong, beefy segments, coupled with high quality, firmly gripping extension couplers. At the top is a nice ball adjusted swivel head. The head screws onto the pole via a standard 1/4x20 screw in the pole, mating to the socket of this head or any other you want to put in its place. The head itself locks easily, and moves easily when you loosen the locking screw.<br />As pictured, on the side you get an adapter whose name I don't know, but it's designed for the mount that a lot of light boxes and reflectors and production lights come with.<br />It also comes with a spring loaded phone holder clip. The clip has a 1/4 socket on the back and on one end for mounting options. On the other end, there's a cold shoe.<br />For me, a product that stands out in the field would get four stars. I need to see a 'wow' in order to give that best of the best five stars.  In this case, the fifth star comes in because the wow is due to the opposite end of the competition field.  I don't see any old line, flagship company putting out this product in a way that would be substantially any better than what Neewer offers, but it would be a lot more expensive.<br />So congrats for standing out from the typical competitors. Hearty congratulations for being a better option than the flagships in this case.<br />~Cheers!",[],B0BSFR89K5,B0C3GJQ6HW,AF5VCTKSBI3XRO3W36FITE6O3TMQ,2023-04-19 16:16:27.558,0,False,501
786062,3,Great build but fatal flaws,"I was really excited to get this keyboard. TL;DR the unadjustable sleep timer and long delay to wake up make it unusable. Get the Royal Kludge RK98 instead.<br /><br />Unfortunately it is borderline unusable in wireless 2.4ghz mode, which is the whole reason I chose it. It auto-sleeps after a fairly short period of time and then takes what feels like several seconds to ""wake up"". It is really disruptive to my workflow as I often spend a lot of time reading and then turn to type out my thoughts. With this keyboard the first few words I type are constantly missed. Apparently, with other Akko 2.4ghz keyboards you can change the sleep time in the app but that is not the case with this model. Another minor factor is that this keyboard has nowhere to stow it's USB dongle so that is guaranteed to get lost if you take it on the go.<br /><br />I will directly compare it to the Royal Kludge RK98 which is a direct competitor. I have one as my work keyboard. The Akko comes stock with far superior switches and keycaps. Akko switches and caps are the clear winner of the mid-range custom keyboard market. However, the RK98 doesn't go to sleep as quickly and is much faster to wake up. On the rare occasion I do catch it sleeping, I might miss a keystroke or two. Despite a much less aggressive sleep timer, the RK98 also lasts much longer on battery. Often I go weeks at a time without charging it at work. With the Akko, I am charging every few days. Something is obviously burning battery all day despite the keyboard ""sleeping"" constantly.<br /><br />The upside is that the build quality is very good. As I said, Akko switches are fantastic in this price range. The keycaps feel substantial and I'm a fan of Akko's key profile. They also look great. The letters are bright and crisp. They stand out with no color bleed where the plastic of the letter meets the plastic of the cap body.<br /><br />If I just plugged the Akko 3098b and the RK98 in with USB, the Akko is the far superior board out of the box. Sadly, I purchased this board for its 2.4ghz wireless.<br /><br />I returned it.",[],B09J8N3MMR,B09J8LSG5P,AHOFMWROITNGIT35BLYDAK4URHQA,2023-04-01 02:33:19.861,3,True,501
791657,4,I love this camera but it has it's limitations - Read how to print from other cameras,"First off: I'm happy with this camera. It's a kid's camera that can print in black and white on rolls of thermal paper, which are easy enough to find. I love the look of the dot matrix print outs. They have a cool contrasty look, like some old newspaper picture.<br />The pictures themselves --not the printed ones but the digital versions, are pretty low quality, but comparable to a similar kid's camera i own. So don't expect ""real"" camera digital pictures or even ones as good as your phone.<br />The interface is a little funky, don't throw away the instructions until you have figured everything out. It's not very intuitive so it will require some time with it so you can teach your kid to use it. For example when picking options, it's the one that is greyed out and NOT highlighted that's the choice, which seems counter-intuitive. To delete a picture (not in the instructions) pick the picture and press the ""ok"" button for a few seconds and then you'll get the option to delete.<br />All pictures have a date on the side and there doesn't seem to be a way to take this off.<br />Can you use it to print pictures taken in a different camera? Yes and no. I experimented and it was able to print some pictures but not others. Here's one trick: it seemed to only recognize JPG's with the same file naming convention as the pictures it takes (as in it will accept a picture called ""PHO00004.JPG"" but not one called ""dog.jpg""). And out of those it will only print some. I wasn't able to figure out exactly what it takes to be recognized. It couldn't find pictures taken with my ""real"" camera but it was able to read ones take with my other kid camera. And because those pictures didn't have the same aspect ratio, it printed them elongated. So when it comes to printing for all practical purposes assume that it will only print the pictures taken with the camera and not other jpg's you load onto the memory card. But that's fine, after all it wasn't advertised for that, though it would have been nice if it did print pictures taken with other cameras.<br />So overall i'm happy with the camera, but don't expect too much from it. The prints look cool and the paper is cheap to replace, so it's all good.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uGI23hsAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uGI23hsAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uGI23hsAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09XQPVFT6,B0BS38FMPH,AH7VBSXJRT7HMPFH5UIXFGXD6UHQ,2023-03-01 00:56:49.807,0,False,501
977511,4,One Travel Router to Rule All Your Devices Wi-Fi Logins On The Go,"The GL.iNet MT3000 Beryl AX Pocket Sized Wi-Fi 6 Travel Router is a small and nifty device that packs a lot of features. From the basic Wi-Fi router (dual 2.4/5G bands) to VPN eligible, and even network storage capable.<br /><br />As of currently (3/14/2023), this is tied as being the company’s newest device lineup (the other being the GL-AXT1800 Slate AX). Between the two, they are similar in being Wi-Fi 6 routers (faster speeds). The Beryl AX does have a higher maximum 5G speed (2402 Mbps) and one 2.5G Gig WAN Port (takes advantage of higher incoming internet speeds through ethernet). It also comes with a plethora of interchangeable international travel plugs, fitting as a travel router (though it can be powered through any USB C cable, such as in a power bank). For higher intensity usage (such as with VPN, etc) the router has a small fan underneath to dissipate heat and reduce temps (for basic usage, it almost never turns on at normal room temperature, plus temp range of activation can be adjusted). Compared to the previous iteration, Beryl MT1300, it does lose one LAN port (unfortunate) and is a bit heavier.<br /><br />As many others have said, this router packs a lot of features, many of which are beyond what an average user would tap into. But for the basic wireless features, the settings gateway seems clear enough and there are plenty of instructions on how to set things up without too much technical knowledge required.<br /><br />As for range, though this router isn’t intended to replace a typical home router, it does decent for something this small. On the go, it’ll cover around a hotel room or so.<br /><br />Overall, I had no problems using the many functions of this router (repeater mode, ethernet mode) at home as well as at hotels I have stayed at.<br /><br />NOTE: The Beryl AX MT3000 does not support EAP (e.g. EduRoam in many colleges) just like the previous iteration of this series line and denoted in the listings description above, so just be aware if that is one of your intended use cases (and can possibly consider the Slate line instead).","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FcP1Jo2fL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FcP1Jo2fL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FcP1Jo2fL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BPSGJN7T,B0BPSHV3K8,AERRJVNE5AXTCKG4XLVNHIFG7MTA,2023-03-14 20:57:20.600,0,False,501
87161,5,"If you live for adventure, this is the one you’re looking for","So as I write this I’m actually shopping for a new speaker. I’ve had this exact speaker from 2017-2022. Let me tell you, This thing has seen all the worst of my travels. I’m a seasonal worker and I frequently travel for a variety of jobs across the country.<br /><br /> I bought it while living in Maine and I needed it for its weather resistance and long battery as I lived in the wilderness building a section of the Appalachian trail. It held up great! Literally in a 9 day hitch of using it constantly during my 8 hour  shifts I only had to charge it once! (With a battery pack) We worked in rain or shine and the speaker was right there with us giving us trail workers good tunes as we felled trees and made stone staircases.<br /><br />Then I went to Colorado and would have it chilling in my pocket as I shred the ski resort on my board every time I bit the edge of my board it took a tumble with me. And it didn’t take a scratch!<br /><br />I’ve used it while I was a bum on the beach in the<br />Caribbean and I had to walk to a public beach and it was trusty and true in a time when I didn’t know where my next meal was coming from.<br /><br />Then I took it to Alaska where I sail and look at glaciers and whales  for tours out here. When I’m in a rush and needed to tune out the sound of the giant engines I work around, it was again right there with me. And even when I was wrenching on the boat it would take paint/ harsh chemicals and again nothing stopped it.<br /><br />So you may wonder “well why am I shopping for one now?” Well my dumb@ss left it at a bonfire during the northern lights going off forgot it and it got swiped. So I need a new replacement to something that’s been with me as I’ve seen it all.<br /><br />And I don’t know if people from the company reads these things but it would truly make me happy if there was something you folks could do to get me a new one.

The main problem with this is that now-a-day there are very few PC Cases that even have the space for more than 2 HD Spaces and finding one with 5 bays that are open will impossible or at the very least, will be very difficult to find....<br /><br />I recently put together a NEW PC with a Ryzen 16 Core CPU and was looking for a case that had 2 5 1/4' Hard Drive Bays that were open (1 for a CD/DVD Drive and 1 for a 6 Port USB connection and Memory Card Port Reader).

It feels nice, too.<br />The tag says that there might be a slight odor for a few days.

I have packed the bag with my laptop, charger, pad of paper, little makeup bag, headset and other items - and it stays upright, and is easy to carry with the extra strap to go over my shoulder.<br /><br />- Outside zipped roomy compartment for an office badge or cell phone, a mirror - whatever you need - there is room!<br /><br />- Beverage sleeve/holder - It's a little strange to me that the beverage/water bottle sleeve is inside the bag;  the material for the beverage holder is not waterproof - so that means if the bottle is cold, there will be condensation that is absorbed by the material.  I will line that area with something waterproof so it doesn't ruin the inside and leak onto pads of paper or folders I may have in the bag.  I haven't tried that yet.  Or, I won't use it for a water bottle.  I have used it for a dry umbrella and that works nicely.  I still wouldn't but it would get everything wet inside if wet.<br /><br />- Adjustable handles and strap.

The chat option is just a person (potentially robot) responding to your questions with a pre-typed answer. And they constantly asked me to open the Wyze app, but I’m using my phone for the chat, and you get disconnected from the chat if you leave it. So that was useless. If you have purchased a camera or any subscription from anywhere other than their website, Wyze has zero access to any of your information. They can not see any account, they can not see if you have any cameras connected to that account, and they can not see any subscriptions you are paying them for.<br /><br />I spent 40 minutes on the phone with a customer service rep. In that time they talked me through all the settings and had me reboot my camera. Which put me back to square one. At the end of the call I had to submit a log to their team and now I’m waiting for answers.<br /><br />I then asked about refunding my card. I have a monthly subscription that allows me to record 24/7. I was told they do not refund, all purchases are final. Even though their product isn’t working. I was directed to request a refund through Apple/google services because Apple/google are the ones that process the billing. Even though the service (or lack their of) is coming from Wyze. Cameras are suppose to help with pieces of mind. When I needed them to work, they didn’t. When I asked the company for help, they didn’t.<br /><br />Do not waste your time on these products.",[],B08R59YH7W,B0C1VP1GGK,AHNZ37KV2S32BGIRY3QWK3VIZGTQ,2023-02-02 01:05:07.735,6,True,501
153728,4,Impressively Powerful Little Tool,"I find I need small amounts of compressed air fairly regularly.  Not only to clean keyboards and computer equipment, but when servicing firearms, and cleaning out charging ports on smartphones and tablets, and cleaning off my workbenches.<br /><br />This little guy works wonders at getting small crevices clean and it is more powerful than I expected.  I usually only need it for short bursts, so I haven’t testing the battery run time, but it requires little charging after I’ve used it for a short time.  I was happy to see it uses the better USB-C charging port instead of the micro-USB that so many other brands still seem to use. When you plug-in the charging cable, red it’s charging, and green indicates charging is complete.<br /><br />What makes this shine over other similar models, is that it is also a small vacuum.  Just pop on the attachment onto the back and reverse your hand hold, and you can take advantage of some pretty decent suction.  It’s a bagless design, and you just empty the canister after use.<br /><br />The supplied various attachments and tools are very helpful for getting a precise air flow.  I also like than a keyboard key puller is included. It was also a pleasant surprise to realize that it has an LED light that illuminates when the unit is turned-on.  It’s also nice that you have three different speed settings to choose from.<br /><br />Any cons?  Only a few nitpicks for which I am deducting one star.  The manual is not written by someone with a command of the English language, so it took a few moments to figure out how to use or fasten each attachment, but it wasn’t long before I figured it out.  It also would have been nice if some sort of case or storage sack had been included instead of having to use the packaging box.  Lastly, I can’t find a way to replace the battery when it eventually fails in several years, as all rechargeable batteries eventually do.  Fortunately, this is not an expensive unit to begin with.<br /><br />Despite my nitpicks, at this price this is more feature rich than many units that are twice the price.  If you need one of these, it would be hard to beat this guy.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+5Qt4QIDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+5Qt4QIDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+5Qt4QIDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+xxBi0iBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+xxBi0iBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+xxBi0iBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61aS-7dNV8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61aS-7dNV8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61aS-7dNV8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71A5XXq9gfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71A5XXq9gfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71A5XXq9gfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71F-2a9-ftL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71F-2a9-ftL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71F-2a9-ftL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MSWXLEU2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MSWXLEU2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MSWXLEU2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71socgv6HkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71socgv6HkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71socgv6HkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BR7NNDJJ,B0C1JQTSB3,AEE3VI5TNDKDUNUI3IAYO3ZUAYVQ,2023-04-04 20:55:10.044,1,False,501
674567,5,Lots of storage in a small package,"I love listening to Old Time Radio shows and have been storing them on my phone. Well, that takes up a lot of valuable space. So when this was made available it was an instant order. It holds all of the shows that were on my phone and much more. I will be storing video content to watch on demand too. You can store so much more as well.<br /><br />This device is a very small item but can hold so much. Almost 64gb of storage. Unlike many other storage devices that I have come across at times, this one actually holds what it says it will. None of those large claims only to find that it will hold half of the rated numbers. This tells it as it is.<br /><br />Performance is great and it responds quickly. Working with it is simple too. No major hoops to jump through in order to get it working. Just download the items to your computer and then transfer them to the drive. Retrieval is just as easy. I have not tried downloading directly from the phone but I am sure that it will also do just that. Find it on your device and open and play. No drivers required.<br /><br />This is a very stoutly built drive too. It is made of a very strong material. It looks like it can take a beating and still operate. There are 2 plug ports to use, one is  a USB A treminal plug and the second is a Type C. It has a swinging cover that can be placed over the unused portion. Wish they had some sort of cover for the other end when it isn't plugged into anything. These multi port treminals allow you so much latitude. It can easily be used on a phone, computer, laptop, tablet, even some televisions. Mine accepts a USB A plug in device. And... my truck even has a port to plug this into. They say that it can also be used on a Mac.<br /><br />When in use I am saving my phone's power as well as keeping my phone available if needed.

659195,3,I was not happy with the way this desk functioned,"Let me preface that there are a lot of pros with this.<br /><br />This is a very sturdy desk when you get it into the correct position that you want it in. It already comes fully assembled, which is nice, but it can be a bit challenging trying to get it how you want.<br /><br />You do have to push down on the lever while pressing down on the desk then lifting it up.<br /><br />If you turn it over, you see where there are notches in the metal bar that is supposed to click or latch onto depending on the height you are trying to achieve. I actually wanted to use this to raise my monitor up because I didn't have a monitor stand at home.<br /><br />I figured out how to raise up the desk on its own without anything on it, and I made sure that it was sturdy enough that it could hold some weight. Once I figured that out, I brought it up to my office desk and placed my monitor on top. I proceeded to follow the same instructions on lifting it up, only once it had the weight on it, it would not latch onto any of the notches until it was fully expanded. I tried it numerous times, despite the fact that it was a bit heavy with my monitor on it, and I went slowly to try to get it to latch onto the lower notches. It just would not work.<br /><br />I removed my monitor and placed the desk upside down on the floor to see if I was crazy with thinking there were actual notches like I originally thought, and there were notches. I attempted to lift the legs backwards (in other words, the top of the desk was flat on the floor and the legs in the air where I could see the mechanisms working) and it seemed to catch on the notches while it was upside down. I saw that it was working, so I flipped it right side up and replicated this movement, but it would not latch correctly.<br /><br />Maybe I have a defective product, but I'm not so sure. It seems if you want it all the way up or all the way down, those are the two options, unless you're willing to flip it over to get it to the height you want. I feel like that kinda defeats the purpose, although it is a desk riser so it does serve that purpose if that's all you're looking for.",[],B0BD4HKNLZ,B0C6FBDP63,AE6OIHXRCIHOQFBYPG5ETCVJDMLA,2023-01-16 15:21:32.035,0,False,501
387960,2,"Nice look, but horrible design & hardware","Nice look and durable composite wood.<br />I spent two hours putting this stand together.<br /><br />But, it was one of worst experiences I’ve had putting furniture stuff together. I’m sure an elderly person would be way more mad than I am.<br /><br />Due to its horrible design, particularly that the top section uses wood dowels, the stand doesn’t stop falling apart until the last step when the metal supports/legs are screwed onto the sides of the stand.<br /><br />Now the long screws that were used…the heads were made for Allen wrench installation. How dumb. Allen wrench kept falling off the strew. And since it falls apart so easily before one side of the legs/support are screwed on, good luck reaching for the Allen wrench every time it pops off the screw, when you risk knocking the pre-complete flimsy design trying to reacquire the wrench.<br /><br />The 1/2” backing screws have Phillips heads on them, so the long nearly 2” screws should’ve also had Phillips heads.<br /><br />Getting to the backing…not only does it have a piece of duct tape holding the top & bottom section together, it doesn’t even sit/fit correctly between the two sections.<br /><br />Also, while there are pre-drilled holes on the wood composite backing, the holes on the stand stand on the top section didn’t even line up, and even though I flipped the boards around. So now any elderly people have to use extra strength to screw 4 screws into the side boards of the top section of the stand.<br /><br />And since there were 2 extra backing screws, they could’ve also pre-drilled holes for the middle of the very top & bottom of the stand.<br /><br />And after screwing the legs/supports on during the last step, the middle shelf board doesn’t even tighten/close the gap completely between the top & bottom side boards.<br /><br />Truly an annoyance putting this stand together.<br /><br />Although I was surprised to see a screwdriver included with the hardware, the manufacturer should redesign how it’s put together, besides using only Phillips head screws and checking quality control to make sure backing holes are drilled in correct places on the board pieces.",[],B0BFPLWJ6G,B0C99BGFG5,AF7DWJISPVXCMLJD27UIVR6G2QWA,2023-03-26 20:38:13.155,0,True,501
654969,5,AMAZING CRISP PICTURE!,"My old Elephas projector just was just not cutting it for my events. I have 150"" screen and it was blurry, distorted and the color was completely off. After searching for anweek to see if there was anything I could do for the elephas, I found they no longer had support.  I opened Amazon and this was the first projector that popped up.  I looked at a few others but they just didn't have what I wanted and the ability for a 450"" projection and Bluetooth was very attractive.  After reading different reviews on different projectors I decided to give this one a go. One of the reviews for this machine said the outside casing looked 3d printed... it doesn't. It has some nice texture and the casing is very well made. I tested the size and clarity outside during the day on the side of my 2 story home. Even Un the sun while dim, I could still see just fine. It was clear, crisp and the color is AMAZING! The size of the projection definitely goes up to and probably over 450"" it took up a large section of the side of my house. The sound is FANTASTIC! My son didn't realize it had a speaker so when I turned on a movie he bout jumped out of his skin because I had turned the sound up so high haha! The controls and settings are very user friendly and easy to maneuver. Setting it and connecting via Bluetooth is amazingly easy! My Samsung and my husband's iPhone were able to pick it up with no issues whatsoever.  It comes with a VERY nice protective case for carrying and storage.<br />The only thing I will say just because it freaked me out at first. Make sure your power supply is strong enough!!! The first time I turned it on... it turn on, went to the home screen for the projector then shut off. It did this 3 times. We were in the garage so I took it in the house and plugged it into the kitchen wall and it was fine. I also plugged it into the extension cord I was using to test to see if it was the socket in the garage or if it was the extension cord. It also worked fine with the extension cord. So just be sure the socket you plug it into has enough power to run it or it will turn itself off. Which honestly seems like a great safety feature for the life of the projector.<br />I really have absolutely nothing bad to say about this projector at all.",[],B085TDV9DW,B085TDV9DW,AFZLCTVEK2MFCETJ5P35H42B6MCQ,2023-04-30 21:53:36.023,0,True,501

Mouse is pretty low quality i had a keyboard similar to the one comes with this not a bad keyboard but it lacks anti-slip pads and believe me when i say it sucks on a desk without them lol. (put some on it you'll thank me later) Screen protector was defected. I know how can you defect a screen protector, right? i have no idea but they did, there was a fairly large spot that didn't have adhesive and it made it look like an air bubble but actually was just where it wouldn't stick lol. Oh well I don't need it anyways. Camera quality is terrible both rear and front so don't buy it for the camera. I mainly use tablet as a security cam screen lol. But worked great for that, I do play some retro emulators on it. Does freevee pluto tv movie and video stuff fairly well works good for e-booking to. The screen and color gamut looks great, images look great on it. Touchscreen side is sensitive and responsive atleast for now it is, good enough for me.<br /><br />The biggest flaw in my opinion is it's bluetooth it wont pair/connect with all BT versions. i don't know about 4.0 dont have anything to test but i cant get it to pair anything 5.1+ it literally causes a driver glitch so bad that it disables BT fully and only way to fix it is to restart the tablet. This maybe a Build v1.0 android 11 bug because I'm pretty sure it's software/driver related. BT works fine for some earbuds and wireless controller I had, though I'm unsure what their BT versions are. Keyboard included is BT 3.0 and works fine. I have a BT 5.1 keyboard and a BT 5.2 mouse that wont pair and causes the driver bug, keyboard and mouse works i used it on another budget android 11 tablet and smartphone with so issues.<br /><br />Anyways, not bad for $105 with coupon unfortunately i was taxed at $140 I wouldn't give $140 if I had paid cash included mouse/kb etc wouldn't even costed $40if you bought it singled out lol.<br /><br />Take care, I hope my review helps.",[],B096Y1NZMS,B0C6K54XT9,AGDIL75Z4O5SX4RIOFPVTYRKC3ZA,2023-03-11 01:02:37.807,0,False,501
63909,3,Welcome ol' 2003 Infiniti FX to 2023 Technology,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this T86DVR model - the least expensive front & rear dash cam with both Android Auto & CarPlay.  So far, I'm very happy with it after a month of use.  The wide and not so tall aspect looks really nice atop my dash and doesn't obstruct my view.  All the wires are hidden so it looks nicely integrated.<br /><br />Power is through a 12V to 5DC USB converter hidden behind the factory head unit.  The hardest part of the install by far is cleanly running the wire from the rear camera to the dash.<br /><br />The internal speaker and the FM transmitter sound was fine for navigation and calls but not that good for music.  Using the Aux output to the car's amp is much better.<br /><br />Android Auto (version 9.0.x) is working really well, including Coolwalk features.  I have had a few random disconnections but only when my spouse was in the car with her iPhone.  Maybe her phone is trying to connect to CarPlay which causes the AA disconnects?  In any case CarPlay works perfectly well for her when she drives the car.<br /><br />The dash cam quality is pretty good, both front and rear.  It's quite nice now to have a backup camera that has really good night vision.<br /><br />The best part is being able to keep my phone in my pocket and having it connect wirelessly to Android Auto (or CarPlay) and automatically bringing up navigation map using Android Driving Mode.  No longer do I have to make a run back to the car to get my phone off the dash.<br /><br />Lastly, I had some questions I needed help with and contacted USManju@163.com.  I received very prompt and helpful replies and videos from Irelia in customer support.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Lowered the rating due to not being able to have a phone conversation while driving, even with the windows up.  People simply can't understand me due to the audio breaking up.  Voice commands are spotty as well.  Calls through Android Autp do work OK when I pull over and stop and the engine still running.

This is not your ordinary 10000mah power bank created for your typical user, it is much more than that. THIS thing is a beast that transforms from a brick to a charging stand, to a phone charger and an apple watch charger with a flick of the wrist. It flourishes a bright LED display showing the charge of base and an added USB input on the side for those extra devices you might want charge on the side. I tested the charger using my iPhone 12 Pro Max with a Mag safe compatible case and it worked flawlessly as the phone charged from 5% to 50% in 30min. The base charged my Apple Air pods Pro like a champ, but sadly the Apple watch charging arm was a downright stinker. The charger for the Apple watch charges the watch, but the magnet on stand is weak and relies on the watch band to keep it in place as shown in the picture. I don't use a metal band or the original Apple watch band which I like to think most people don't, to wear their watch, so I currently use a thicker band for my watch because I have big wrist and the stand seems to not compensate for that, but for those who wear metal bands, it would be perfect, so I'm out of luck for my watch for now. The power bank is not heavy, but hefty, although very portable for whenever you are on the go and comes in handy when traveling, hiking or just need a little juice for just an emergency.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />After only a week, the charger stopped working. NO LIGHTS, NO CHARGE, nothing works. Tried the next day and still dead. I might have received a dud, but on the bright side, I have myself a nice little paperweight.

909088,5,A beautifully dynamic sound.,"I needed a good pair of active noise cancelling headphones, so I gave these Tozo X1’s a shot (Amazon makes trying things out super easy) , and WOW, these earbuds don’t disappoint.<br /><br />  Putting these in my ears, for the first time, felt great! The low profile earbuds come with 6 different sets of inserts, to fit my ears, and the design of the actual earbud is such, that it fits the form of your ear, and locks into the intertragal notch of your ear, basically making it impossible to fall from your ear.<br /><br />  Turning them on for the first time to listen to music, was a dream. I’ve never heard such dynamic sound from an earbud. I’d liken the definition, and bass boost, to that of an over-the-ear set of headphones. I could even hear a dynamic shift in the sound quality of the podcasts that I listen to.<br /><br />  I wore these earbuds in the engine room that i work in, with the active noise cancelation turned on, and I could hear my music/podcasts without having to turn the sound up. These not only sound great, but will save your hearing by not having to turn sound up, to drown out ambient noise. You don’t even have to take them out to have a conversation, just simply tap the left earbud, and you can use transparent mode, and suddenly it amplifies the ambient noise, to the levels of not even wearing hearing protection! It even has an active move (off) so I can have a nice mixture of music, and ambient noise,  to play the drums.<br /><br />  I’m getting about 5 hour playtime on them, but the case recharges them back to full within a 20 minute work break. So I’m never really without my tunes, The case not only shows the battery life remaining on the case, but what the battery level is, on both of the earbuds, during charging. The case can also be recharged on a wireless charger.<br /><br />  These are my go-to earbuds now, well worth the price, I’m almost sad now, that I’m addicted to a more expensive earbud.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51FWs4JoLLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51FWs4JoLLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51FWs4JoLLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51MeJa0NmKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51MeJa0NmKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51MeJa0NmKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611Eibv3qxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611Eibv3qxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611Eibv3qxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BS3SYYBP,B0BS3SYYBP,AHKVAONK34N2MUWSVJZNPDWKTWNA,2023-03-31 08:53:32.215,2,True,501
155151,3,"Camera works good, app is awful.","This is really a great quality dash cam but I have run into a few issues with it.  It is not the easiest to set up.  It basically has to be plugged into a power source or it doesn't power up.  It comes with a short usb cord/plug to use in the house and a cigarette lighter plug for in the car.  The in car plug has a very long cord so it is easy to snake it around your dash to wherever you need to hang the camera. The suction cup to mount it has a lock that makes it easy to hang up and sturdy.  Initially the micro usb provided by the company would not work in the camera so I had to go out and purchase an additional card.  I opted for a much larger storage card anyway so this wasn't a huge deal but was an extra cost for an already pricy device. Once I finally got a card that worked and put the camera up, it does what it is supposed to do.  It begins recording clips that are of very good quality as you are driving.  You can set the timer for the screen to time out and  a screensaver comes up with the time on it.  I like this so it is not as distracting as you are driving.  I did notice that after a few short drives the camera is really HOT.  Hopefully this will not affect the longevity and functionality of the camera.<br />Video clips are not hard to review on the camera but the screen is pretty small so you get a better picture if you insert the card into your computer.  Ideally you should be able to view the clips and gallery on your phone through the company's app but I am pretty tech savvy and have not been able to connect the app to the camera on my iphone.  It is supposed to connect via wifi with a password and just flat out refuses to connect for me.  I have been unable to use the app at all so every time I want to review clips I have to take the camera down.  I had to set my phone to forget my home wifi and only recognize the camera wifi and still it will not connect.  It would be  much better if it connected via bluetooth but that's not the way it is set up... although you have to have bluetooth enabled to get the app to sync?

Has a nice honeycomb pattern<br /><br />- Reliable bluetooth - Bluetooth connection hasn't failed me yet. After pairing I just turn it on and it works immediately as expected with no interruptions.<br /><br />- Medium Weight - I like hefty keyboards and this has medium weight. So do not expect a super lightweight keyboard.<br /><br />- Quiet Keys - There is some slight noise but pretty quiet for a keyboard, definitely quieter than most of my mechanical keyboards<br /><br />Neutral:<br />- Key positioning - I understand that this is compact keyboard but some keys are out of position - Delete, Home, Insert, PgUp, PgDn, End. So if you use those keys a lot, better get used to the weird positioning. Everything else is somewhat normal.<br /><br />- Okay Pricing - Seems right for a decent quality bluetooth keyboard, it does not feel low quality<br /><br />- Rechargeable Micro-USB - This would be better if it was USB-C<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Hexagon keys - These will inhibit efficiency if you are used to normal square ones, so this will decrease your typing speed. Not a good keyboard to learn on either as you will get used to hexagon keys and not be as efficient on the more ubiquitous square keys. The loss to efficiency is not super high though, and if you were so inclined you could probably get back that efficiency with a little practice and getting used to it. I am not so inclined, so this will be a last use case keyboard for me.<br /><br />- No Leg Height Elevation - There is a slight raised rubber backing on the back to give it very small height. However, this is not nearly enough height for a normal raised back keyboard. Back legs would be nice.",[],B0BFQP38T8,B0BL117X28,AGWJ2XAMW427BPYZMH72PABBWXEQ,2023-04-02 18:26:59.202,0,False,500

I am an advanced earbud reviewer. I listen to A LOT of them on a daily basis. I know and have analyzed in detail the sound of 1MORE EVO, Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro, Bose QC2, Sony WF-1000XM, SoundPEATS Opera5, OnePlus Buds Pro2, Edifier W240TN, Moondrop Nekocake and many others. I can tell you with full confidence:<br /><br />THESE ARE AMAZING VALUE!!!<br /><br />I had no idea what to expect and I think they are shockingly good. Broad soundstage, deep, satisfying bass, great mids and very, very nicely done highs. You can hear all detial and instruments in your songs much better than with comparable earbuds at this price level. Just: WOW!<br /><br />Ergonomics are insane, too. These have a weird shape but they stay in your ears SUPER WELL! They come with two additional ear tip sizes so you can adjust if necessary.<br /><br />Aesthetics: looks are not their strong side but with this crazy good sound - who cares!!!<br /><br />ANC: GOOD! Maybe not Bose level but again, pick your battles at $40!<br /><br />MIC/PHONE CALLS: check out my video here<br /><br />Case: AWESOME. Compact and functional! That's what I'm talking about!<br /><br />Touch controls: they work well, IMHO. You can stop/start songs and change volume with taps. Also cycle between ANC/TRANSPARENCY/OFF modes. An unusual control mode is you can turn individual earbuds on/off with a long press (5 sec). Haven't ever come across that before on any other earbuds. I guess this would be very helpful if you want to take a phone call and use one earbud only without taking them out of your ears.<br /><br />This is 5 stars VERY WELL DESERVED!!!

561029,4,Nice Travel Plug with Minor Issues,"This is a nice, compact, and lightweight power strip. I think it's best suited for traveling rather than on a home or office desk/table.<br /><br />The item works wells. One issue is that it's so lightweight that it tends to move around when you manipulate the cords. As a travel item it should be light, but for a permanent location it's annoying. It's also a bit awkward because the plugs typically stick straight out from all five sides (see picture). But I still like it.<br /><br />I tested the USB chargers. Be aware that the three USB-A (rectangular) connectors share a maximum wattage (15.5w) that's not much higher than the maximum wattage (12w) for a single connector. So if you have three devices plugged in, the maximum power for each one will be about 40% of the maximum power for when a single device is plugged in.<br /><br />I wasn't impressed by the power output of the USB connectors. I found it better to plug our existing 20w chargers into the AC outlets than to use the built-in USB chargers.<br /><br />Regarding the USB chargers, the actual power being sent to my devices was never even close to the maximum ratings in the product listing. The maximum power output ratings are 15w for the USB-C (oval) connector and 12w for a single USB-A (rectangular) connector. I used them to charge a power cube battery, and the actual output was about half of the maximum (8w and 6w). I used them to charge my iPhone and iPad, both of which are older models, and while I got higher numbers (due to ""fast charging"" I assume) I never got above 10w power. Not sure how they'd perform on a late-model iPhone, but the experience with my devices was disappointing.<br /><br />Finally, there are slots in the bottom of the cube to anchor it to a wall or table, but mounting hardware (screws, etc.) is not included.<br /><br />Overall I like this power strip cube. It's compact and light, and would be great for travel. Not as good but still decent for home use. For the lack of stability (due to light weight) and the lower-than-expected USB charging power, I rate it 4/5 stars.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GVQvnCIRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GVQvnCIRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GVQvnCIRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BLRDY4MD,B0BQ5K3CBV,AFY2HBWPUZJTGERN5CRXQAJKDFAA,2023-03-11 19:53:05.911,0,False,500
741198,4,Better than expected but not perfect,"Pros:  Surprisingly good ADAS, quality feel, 4k front camera is impressive, auto reverse is nice, easy install if you are ok with routing the wires its not hard.<br />Cons:  rear camera is not great at night, enough that it can’t be used as a active mirror.  Glare from the mirror affects the display in bright light, wish I could remove the mirror layer but then I would have to cousins on the rear camera at night so that won’t work.  Can’t dash mount as the wires poke out from the top.  ADAS only works on front camera or rear but not both at the Same time.  ADAS only works on the displayed camera.  So to get the front ADAS (collision (car, pedestrian), safe distance, lane departure one has to set it to use the front camera, then I turn off the display aspect so ADAS keeps working with the front camera.  That way I avoid the poor back visibility issues of bright days vs the mirror reflecting faint images of the rear view.  Front camera must be detachable from the morror/display assembly as multiple drivers results in repeated tilting of the mirror/display which moves the front camera so ADAS stops working properly.<br />Perfect would require:  both front and rear use the same 4k front camera model, front camera is not part of the mirror assembly instead it sticks right on the windshield or that ADAS SW auto adjusts on tilt to avoid needing recalibration when the mirror is adjusted, ADAS needs to works on both cameras simultaneously, rear camera needs to be better than mirror both day and night so the mirror layer can be dumped.  Better volume and clearer messages.  Lane departure have an option to be bypassed by the blinkers,  Price needs to be kept around the current price so it does not become a theft magnet.  Connectors need to be sleeker, or attached to a hidden box to make the install cleaner.  All this said i do like it and am considering getting a second one for the RV but it needs about 40’+ of cable to the rear camera.  In an RV the mirror glare is not an issue and there is no need for a mirror so it can be a full time rear view camera, if only the adas would work with the front + rear or at a minimum the camera WHILE displaying the rear camera.",[],B0BF4XB3VP,B0CBBMC596,AFGIV5DMY2TU7JVFRTKYMQYIO3GA,2023-02-02 03:18:04.420,8,True,500
745261,1,Substandard and Not worth it at any price,"Watch died after 4 months. Daily use. Exercise 7 days a week.<br />This was a Garmin replacement for a Vivo4 (which had all the same issues but lasted 1 year)  I was told it was an complete upgrade from the Vivo4 however it has the same cheap internal components. I was offered this because they did not have a Vivo4 to replace mine. (which makes one think many failed) The screen was better (see rating below).<br /><br />Music: 1 - Worked (intermittent cutout) 90% of the time by itself, 70% of the time if used with a workout app, 60% with GPS - Tried with multiple earbuds and headphones that worked flawless on other devices.  Not a useful feature if it doesn't work while working out.<br />Heartrate: 2 - Only was accurate until 100BPM.  Then is was off by +80-100% except when it was showing (footfall) cadence instead of HR. Completely unacceptable for a fitness device.<br />Stair Counter: 0 - Counted 60% of up stairs and 40% of down stairs. Didn't count any if you went up and down quickly like you would do when exercising. (I typically exercise using 2-story 12' flights of stairs)<br />GPS: 1 - Took 5 or more minutes to synch and if you miss the synch window (30 seconds) it reset.  On the best resolution it would not show any change less then 20m in movement when it actually worked. (for example zigzagging 70' / 20m while moving)<br />Step Counter: 3 - Did not like tracking movement unless arm swings were exaggerated.<br />Battery Life: 4 - Surprisingly good and it was supposed to be the weak point.<br />Screen: 5 - Actually decent, bright, good visibility & resolution.  Wish the rest of the watch was half as good.<br /><br />HR Chest monitor (Garmin add on): 4 - however the watch had troubles synching making its use more trouble then its worth.  Accuracy of the HR monitor was good & consistent when it did synch.

435970,5,Great for international travel carry on,"I bought this to use as my carry on bag for an international flight that has a very small carry on size allowance: 21.65” x 15.74” x 7.87”.  None of my suitcases meet this size.  I’m also limited to 17.5 lbs, including my personal item.  That’s a challenge!  We will be checking one bag for two people, so I was looking for a bag for a few more outfits (in case the checked bag gets lost), and all the misc stuff (electronics, meds, toiletries, etc).<br /><br />My first thought when unwrapping this:  Wow, that’s a heavy backpack.  But that included the packing cubes.  It’s much lighter than a rolling suitcase, which is important when every pound counts.  And I’m really amazed how much I can pack into it.  I’m a fan of packing cubes for organization.  I can fit two medium packing cubes in the main section, without expanding the backpack.  Since my entire trip wardrobe fits in two medium packing cubes, this is perfect.<br /><br />I love the front pockets.  One I’ll use for passports.  The other will be for a fanny pack that I keep my plane essentials in (eye mask, chapstick, phone, earbuds, snacks, etc).  The bigger front pocket has great organization, and I like the key chain clip.<br /><br />I’m not traveling with a laptop, so I don’t really have a need for the padded pocket.  It just provides extra padding on the back, in addition to the other padding.<br /><br />The trolley sleeve was a must for me, and this one works well.  It is a canvas strap (not stretchy), right above the horizontal zipper on the back.  It fits snug on the luggage handle, so it won’t shift around.  If you pack the bag too full, you might have trouble sliding it over the luggage handle.<br /><br />I don’t think this will be used as my day bag, it’s a bit heavy for that.  But it works great as a carryon bag for international flights. I like that you can tuck the straps away.",[],B0BG5GRC5Y,B0BMXQGP28,AHQRCH47CQPDGR7M77SC33YHGHLQ,2023-02-02 00:27:32.447,12,True,500

While I actually don't have a display at the moment that supports 4k @ 120 Hz...there are other concerns that have come up for me with testing this product in particular, and are the reason I plan to return this. I can't say with certainty that this device will output 4k @ 120 Hz correctly, and some other reviews point out it does not, but the other problems for me of continuing to use this device now outweigh that.<br /><br />I was happy to be able to output and display at the following formats with this:<br />1080p @ 144 Hz<br />2560x1440 @ 144 Hz<br />2560 x 1600 @ 60 Hz<br />3840 x 2160 @ 60 Hz<br /><br />Ethernet port seems to work well and did not slow down my internet speeds without using the hub versus using it.<br /><br />The problems started to come in for me with using the USB ports in this hub.

362715,3,"Works, but too hissy","I bought two of these to use with my wired headphone / IEM collection. The good: the physical power switch is *really* nice to have vs. the firmware-driven switch in just about every other device of this type. Range is impressive. Pairing works well.<br /><br />The bad: The noise floor of the Bluetooth chipset (or, I'm presuming, the BT chipset) is quite high. It's on par with listening to a cassette Walkman, except that the hiss drops in and out when a song or video starts or stops, making it impossible to fully tune out. The hiss doesn't seem to increase with volume, which is good, but this also means that listening at low volumes - especially to spoken word - sounds particularly rotten as the hiss is comparatively almost as loud as the signal.<br /><br />I've also experienced some glitching / obvious repeated stream micro-dropouts and time corrections at close range for the first 5-10 minutes the 1Mii is on, although this seems to calm down or become less likely the longer the 1Mii has ""broken in"" with any single given Bluetooth source. I know that sounds totally crazy / like snake-oil nonsense, but I've experienced something similar in many other cheaper Bluetooth dongles that seem to need to have time to ""get used"" to a source before the glitches generally stabilize (or maybe other way round, and it's the source that must adapt). This prolonged micro-glitching does seem a bit worse and more obnoxious with the 1Mii, though.<br /><br />I really wish someone like a Sony or Sennheiser, both of whom can clearly manufacture a passable Bluetooth chipset for headphones at a price point, would bring out one of these danged things and do it right, by golly.<br /><br />One last complaint: I don't know why *none* of these things, other than the now-unobtanium Fiio uBTR, ever have garment clips on the back or at least a little case that you could use to ""slip on a clip"" for use with wired headphones. The integrated uBTR clip is / was the best thing ever. Finding an old lanyard/nametag badge clip and super-gluing it onto one of these dongles is not really the same level of awesome, I've found.",[],B08HZ4LKT2,B08HZ4LKT2,AGRBFGQDAGKBT3DK6YRKRPDU7Y5A,2023-03-11 18:01:54.667,1,True,500
943915,4,"Good Sound Reproduction, Good Price AND IPX7 Waterproof","I've been in the market for waterproof earbuds for sometime now as I spend a fair amount of time in the pool and would like to listen to music without worrying about shorting out the earbuds.  When I saw these Vilard JR-TL1 Pro earbuds advertised, and at such a reasonable price, I had to give them a try.<br /><br />Included in the case: hard plastic charging case with strap and charging indicator lights, ear buds, extra eartips, USB-C charging cable, a cleaning swab with cleaning instructions and the very easy to understand instruction booklet.<br /><br />Control:  The earbuds automatically turn on when removed from the case and can also be powered on/off by a 5 second push on the multifunction button.  Pairing was easy. The multifunction button is an area in the center of each earbud's flat outer surface. Control of the voice assistant, of music stop, play, next and last song as well as of phone call answer/reject/hangup are all performed by various number of clicks on one or the other earpiece multifunction buttons. Unlike my experience with some other earbuds which have had the same control system, these worked perfectly.<br /><br />Sound:  Although there is no active noise cancelling there is passive noise cancellation simply by setting the earpieces in your ear.  Sound reproduction of the spoken voice (eg audiobooks) was very crisp and full.  Music, too, was very full, and though not what you would get if spending much more, the sound across bass, middle and high frequencies was clear and crisp throughout.  One possible issue for some is that there is no volume control through the earbuds - volume must thus be controlled from the source.<br /><br />I've worn these earbuds in multiple wet environments and so far have had no problems. If this changes in the future I will update this review.<br /><br />Overall I recommend these JR-TL1 Pro Vilard earbuds for those who want to pay a bargain price for headphones that provide far more than bargain performance. Because there is no volume control built into these earpieces (which would require me to rely on my phone even in wet environments or when in the pool) I have deducted one star - if waterproof use was not an issue they would rate 5.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717Rdzdj+LL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717Rdzdj+LL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717Rdzdj+LL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gM+sGT-1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gM+sGT-1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gM+sGT-1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ux+LlXf4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ux+LlXf4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ux+LlXf4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fgpwUz-3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fgpwUz-3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fgpwUz-3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BHW85482,B0BHW85482,AGZECRBJKJGTE2YGHLLR7WWREDUQ,2023-01-23 21:01:23.869,0,False,500

I was worried due to other iPad stands that I've tried<br />  being a little on the lightweight<br />  and flimsy side, but this stand feels heavy and is sturdy enough to where I'm not worried about the weight<br />  of my iPad tipping it over. It is also very easy to adjust the tablet to whatever screen orientation you prefer.<br />  Adjusting the stand angle, height, and orientation feels smooth and the iPad remains secure during<br />  adjustments.<br />-  The magnets are strong enough to keep my iPad secure, even when I tip the stand forward.<br />-  The silicone pads on the magnetic plate protect your tablet from scratches and also help to keep the iPad<br />  secure. The silicone feet on the base plate ensure that the stand stays in place and won't be easily<br />  knocked off of whatever surface you have it on.<br />-  It has a sleek and modern appearance and it looks great on my desk.<br />-  It folds down nicely and is compact and portable.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-  The only con that I can think of isn't exactly a con because it's just sort of expected, but, this will not work<br />  with a case. I normally keep my iPad in a Logitech Combo Touch case with keyboard that I use for travel<br />  and the case is too thick for the magnets on the stand to securely hold the iPad in place. Not really a big<br />  deal for me because I wasn't expecting it to work well with a case on in the first place, but it's just<br />  something to keep in mind if you don't want to have to take your iPad out of its case to use the stand.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the most sturdy, functional, and attractive iPad stands that I have used. I love how easily adjustable it is and how compact it folds down for travel.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SM724GaVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SM724GaVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SM724GaVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61putktzIJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61putktzIJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61putktzIJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-FsU+gHnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-FsU+gHnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-FsU+gHnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GEkEyM6RL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GEkEyM6RL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GEkEyM6RL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71J2QpP4EGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71J2QpP4EGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71J2QpP4EGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nos08qZEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nos08qZEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nos08qZEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71x4YuL+O+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71x4YuL+O+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71x4YuL+O+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BFKDTR6F,B0BFKDTR6F,AELYFHJ4GGQO4WLCHWVK7VLBXV6Q,2023-02-03 03:44:13.431,1,False,500
655128,4,"Works quite well, but be aware that it takes a little time to connect","My 2017 Mazda did not have Carplay installed at the factory, but I had the Mazda dealership add the module for Carplay and Android Auto. To use the module, I had been plugging in my iPhone or Android phone when I get in the car, which was a giant pain in the place you don't want pain. I had been reading about these wireless options and was excited to get this.<br /><br />I would recommend reading not only the instructions from the seller, but also the comments in many of the reviews here to help you with the initial setup. I have at least four different wireless Carplay/Android Auto adapters, and they all work the same way. Instead of the cable you would normally use, this adapter plugs in to the corresponding USB slot in your car. If you're lucky, the adapter will be recognized immediately and ask you to pair it with your car's Bluetooth. In my case with this adapter, I needed to update the software. If you are having trouble reading the on screen directions, tap the globe in the corner of the screen to change the language. To update the adapter (ONLY UPDATE IF IT DOESN'T WORK INITIALLY), make sure your phone is connected via Bluetooth, open a browser and navigate to 192.168.50.2<br />Follow the directions to finish the update and you should be good after that.<br /><br />Two things to note:<br />1. Since the entire point of this is to prevent the need to manually plug in your phone, your phone will not be charging while you use Carplay as it did before. As long as you're not on a long trip, that shouldn't be an issue, but you will need to plug in your phone to keep it charged if you plan be in the car for hundreds of miles.<br />2. Unlike when you are hard wired for Carplay, your music will not start instantly when you start your car. The adapter usually takes between 15 to 90 seconds to connect after you turn on the ignition, so be patient. It will connect if you give it a minute.<br /><br />Is this the perfect replacement solution to wired Carplay? No, it is not. But for me, the convenience of not having to ALWAYS plug in my phone to use Carplay is worth the slight wait to connect when I get in the car. Your mileage may vary, but it works for me!",[],B0BJ8F1F8R,B0BJ8F1F8R,AHJ6CON7ZCJTZOE6CM2JIJMQEM5A,2023-01-27 00:23:02.775,0,False,500
21110,3,Nice Idea but Needs Work,"I'd purchased three of these with the foolish notion I could get rid of my expensive business telephone lines by purchasing two SIM cards on a discount cell provider and porting over my numbers, but it quickly became apparent that wouldn't work.  To use those three phones, you need six SIM cards and half of them would need to be tied to one of the two numbers I have for my business.  In addition, when one line is in use, there'd be no method to alert the other phones that line was in use.<br />Having three in my possession, I decided to get one SIM card and see about using one as a home phone--something I haven't had for years.  I got a limited $5.00 plan and the phone works just fine.  It wasn't hard to get set-up and the clarity is great.  The biggest problem with the phone is the HORRIBLE Chinese instructions that come with it.  Apart from a horrible translation, the instructions are just completely inadequate.  The phone can supposedly store numbers on the SIM card and on the phone itself, but having tried again and again, I can't figure out how to do it.  The instructions are woefully lacking and working with the on screen menu is impossible.  I'm typically good with tech-gadgets and can figure things out, but not this one, and there very little information online for guidance.  Entering names is done with the numeric keyboard by doing multi-presses of the buttons for the alphabetic characters, but then attempting to put the actual number associated with the name is impossible.  Names are limited to six or seven characters too.  SMS message can be sent, but inputting text via that numeric keyboard is slow and painful.<br />The cell phone era makes memorizing phone numbers a thing of the past, and if a cell phone can't store the numbers you use frequently, its sort of worthless.  I have it on my end table, and its nice to have a backup phone, but rarely use it.  At $5.00 a month for service, I'll keep it a while and keep trying to program numbers, but after about two hours of trying to thus far, I don't hold out any hope of figuring this puzzle out.  Its a great idea, but would be fantastic with a touchscreen and better electronics.  Even at five or six times the price, I'd bite...",[],B09XR1YNQH,B09XR1YNQH,AFCTDL3YAZ2KE5MMGD6P7SZRMYFA,2023-02-17 19:17:32.113,0,True,500
439941,2,Caveat Emptor,"This thing is terrible and, in my opinion, needs to be pulled from the market.<br /><br />It's painfully slow and laggy.  It's almost impossible to use it as a writing device.<br /><br />It is running some version of Android that is so old my password manager doesn't work (installed from the Google Play store).  Half of the apps are in Chinese.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment, though, was the handwriting-to-text transliteration (as it calls it).  I didn't expect it to be as good as the ReMarkable (which is really good, by the way), but it missed every single word I wrote in my natural handwriting.  Even when I just used block letters, it couldn't get all the words.  It translated some of my writing into Chinese.  Why would it even try that?  I'm sure it was gibberish.<br /><br />Here's the thing, if you're going to sell these in other countries make sure they work in the languages for that country.  I know that there is no official language for the USA, but most of us speak English as our first language.  Not trying to sound US-centric, but I do live here and I wanted to use the device in my native language.<br /><br />The reason I didn't go with the ReMarkable was because it is too locked down--but it is far more elegant in other aspects.  I was looking forward to a more open-source (Android) experience so I could use it as an e-reader as well as a writing device, but the version you have on this device is either some strange port or too old for certain apps to work.<br /><br />EDIT:  I have been working directly with tech support to address some of the problems with this device.  They had me turn on ""global handwriting"" which sped up the handwriting in most apps.  However, it's still unnatural because of a slight lag.  The transcription still misses a lot of words though.  The password manager still does not work.  Tech support is really nice and eager to help, but I just can't rate this any higher than two stars.  The device is not ready for public use (at least in the U.S.), but I will give them an additional star for the effort they have put in.",[],B0BY4ZNQ1C,B0BY4ZNQ1C,AEQFTVYQSPHWOJZI4PLHTXABDXCA,2023-03-30 22:12:40.801,8,False,500
42985,4,Good overall quality in a large package,"This camera surprised me in many ways!<br /><br />Build Quality: Out of the box, this camera had a good weight for a webcam. The camera itself is quite large, very wide, and is among the largest webcams I have used. The outer shell is all plastic and feels sturdy. There is a camera lens cover included, however you need to attach this yourself. It is provided with 3M tape already attached, I just thought it was weird that it wasn't just built in. Over time, this could be a problem as the sticky layer could diminish and you would be left without a privacy cover. The camera also features a clip that attaches to your screen and also has a screw hole to fit onto a camera mount for more flexibility.<br /><br />Image Quality: Here I was on the fence. The image quality is acceptable to good. It felt more like 1080p than 4K, as advertised. The picture felt a little grainy instead of crisp like other 4K cameras I have used. Colors appear close to how they actually are, so no complaints there. This camera worked very well in my low light room, and this could have contributed to a little more of the graininess.<br /><br />Other features: This camera comes with an AI feature where the image will follow you around the room while focusing on your face the whole time. While this feature is pretty cool, it stutters when following you around instead of being smooth transitions. For the viewer, this is not very good. Cool feature that needs a little work. The AI can easily be turned off with a button behind the camera. I say button because it does push in, however this button is actually touch sensitive and doesn't need to be pressed at all. My camera has a little typo on this button. On/Of was printed instead of On/Off, which is not that big of a deal, but something worth mentioning.<br />There was also a remote provided with the camera, where you can access features without having to leave your app/game. This was a welcome extra.<br /><br />Overall, I think I can recommend this camera. There are a lot of cool features provided. The camera quality may not be actual 4K quality, but I feel the image is good enough for most applications. It's definitely a huge upgrade to any built-in laptop camera, but maybe a little to bulky for smaller laptops.",[],B0BL2CKSCM,B0C4D36MH4,AHMQALBKCRV7VN46WSO3YJ2B7KUA,2023-01-08 22:31:39.497,0,False,500
860539,4,I don't think the noise cancellation works but for me I love them!,If I needed noise cancellation I would probably have to deduct another star from the rating. and the only reason I gave this four stars out of five really is the price for me. as far as the noise cancellation goes the different methods that it has on it sounds like it's more static that it adds to drown out the noise which I am not sure if that's how all noise canceling works but it bothered me so I just turned it off. you do have the ability to do that which is awesome so I just use them as regular earbuds. the second part is the price itself I think is too high. I have the pixel buds which I got for the same price as these and I would say sound wise they might be slightly better.  The sound of these are actually really good and I am actually carrying these more than my pixel buds as I think they are a little more comfortable for me.<br />I wanted the black but only white was available but when I received my order I actually received the black which I was fine with. the case is a little thicker than the pixel buds case. but it is shorter so I think it is probably a little easier to carry as well. I do have a pixel phone and I love the way the pixel buds integrate into the phone as far as some of the features and the way the phone can tell me that charge level of the case as well as each earbud. charging these is the same as you just put them in the case and you can charge the case when it gets down to a certain level. my pixel buds I'm able to see the case level so I know more when I need to charge it versus this case I just try to charge once a week or every other week depending on how often I use these buds. I have had many sessions of three to four hours and they lasted with no warning of  needing to be charged. I would say around $70 maybe 80 these would be worth it still. but if you're an Android User I still think the pixel buds might be the best option. I do really like the way these look as well versus the pixel buds. I have not had any issues with these connecting to my phone anytime I open the case and remove a bud. they connect pretty quick one by itself or both. I would definitely recommend if you have a lower budget and if these were cheaper then $100 they would be a great option and work I would imagine for most people.,[],B0BG6ZCGK8,B0BG6Y2S9L,AG4XR73CIAPUIOBAS3VMN6F5SFTA,2023-02-15 04:52:49.812,0,False,500
31915,3,Very weird and funky app.,"Important things to note:<br /><br />1. Requires you to download an app to connect the camera to your Wi-Fi and use an interface to your camera while you are away from home (to watch video events, live stream, and so on).<br /><br />2. Has cloud service, but I wouldn't.<br /><br />3. The microSD card slot is on the bottom of the camera -- not the base -- to access the slot, pull the camera away from the base to expose it and the reset switch.<br /><br />4. From app, go to settings and have it only record video on events rather than record everything. It's not clear from the app or the manual what happens when you run out of space.<br /><br />5. Format microSD card from the app (it will format as FAT32). I tried it with a 32-GB card, and it appeared to work, but phone app still says 0% used space even after recording a few events and watching them. After pulling the SD card out and putting it on a PC, it indeed hadn't saved anything. I actually had to go to the app settings page and tell it to download the events to the microSD card. After that, pulling it out and putting in a PC, I was able to watch the videos on a PC. The video files are very low-quality TS files.<br /><br />6. App allows you to remotely activate an alarm (I didn't test it) and remotely talk (I tried it and I could barely make out what I was saying).<br /><br />I would have given this 4-stars if events were automatically saved to the SD card. It's funny because there is definitely some kind of internal storage, and if you don't have the SD card inside the camera -- you can't watch them EVEN IF THERE'S NOTHING STORED ON THE CARD. They way it works is very sloppy. The app on the app store also has a ton of bad reviews and complaints from users. For example, I can't figure out how to delete video events from within the app. There are lots of things that you think should be by default implemented in this app, but they aren't. It really is very weird. If they fix these things, and make the app easier to use, I'd definitely give it 4-stars.",[],B0BY24VJ99,B0BY24VJ99,AFTHWVOZJW4JACJD5AZ7ZFZATS3A,2023-04-04 09:08:39.084,0,False,500

There isn’t a place for a subwoofer on my bar, so this model best suited my needs in this location. The sound from my Echo Dot was OK, this sound bar is much better. To be clear, the sound is not audiophile quality, but not every location requires audiophile sound and the price that they can cost.<br /><br />Installation was easy. In my case, the sound bar mounts on the wall under the shelving.  Assembly of the sound bar is easy, it has two halves that connect by a single wire and then slide together with groves in the housing. (see pic)<br /><br />There are multiple input options available: Audio jack, USB-A, Bluetooth, optical and HDMI.  I connected the sound bar to my Amazon Echo Dot via Bluetooth. Input type is indicated on the sound bar with different color LED, for instance, Bluetooth is blue.  There are different sound options, selectable by remote, including: Standard, Movie, Music, Night, 3D. When playing from the Echo Dot via Bluetooth, the Play/Pause button on the sound bar remote will start and stop the music playing.<br /><br />Set up and installation took less than 15 minutes, simply connect the parts and plug in. Mostly of my installation was for wall mounting into plaster wall over cement block. The included hardware and template made the placement easy..<br /><br />The package includes the sound bar, a remote control, an audio cable, an optical cable, two optional wall standoffs for extra space behind for wiring, mounting hardware and wall template and a user guide. (see pic) The remote requires two AAA batteries, not included. An HDMI cable is not included if you plan to connect to HDMI ARC.<br /><br />If your location can accommodate a subwoofer, I suggest you consider the LARKSOUND 2.1 Sound Bar with Subwoofer from the same brand.  It’s not much more cost and the sound is improved by the subwoofer. Otherwise the two sound bars are similar.<br /><br />I’m very happy with this sound bar and look forward to entertaining with it in my home bar and hope this information has been helpful","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LPPalfqtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LPPalfqtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LPPalfqtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MsS9rzJoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MsS9rzJoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MsS9rzJoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cP9i6GLJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cP9i6GLJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cP9i6GLJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81hGoUW3VYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81hGoUW3VYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81hGoUW3VYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BRCQVPT9,B0C5RMJFP8,AFFOEERM6IXHT7T2CW3BTJMLP2DA,2023-04-18 19:59:44.563,0,False,500

195686,5,"Well thought out, but room for improvement.","Introduction:<br />Let me start by saying that this is a well thought out case and is well worth the asking price. To take full advantage of this case in my opinion, you would need one of the newer higher end motherboards that came with a USB 3.2 header on the motherboard. You will also need a power supply which preferably has a argb fan.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- for a full atx case, it is actually very small. You can probably fit an eatx motherboard into this case.<br />- cable management is well thought out.<br />- your psu fan can act as an intake fan & also can take air from the front instead of the bottom. This allows you to put the case on the ground comfortably.<br />- radiator support is very broad and reservoir support is very broad too. The space is open and modular to setup variations.<br />- has more than 4 spots for 2.5 inch drives.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- front has no filter.<br />- on the cable management side, I think they could have cut out some more holes and allowed for different placements of the hhd trays. For those who use 3.5 inch drives, there is only apparent space for 2 drives or 3 with some slight modification.<br />- No vertical gpu mounting options. At this price point, it's more of an expectation. Especially since Vetroo has cheaper cases with this option.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I am comparing this case to a similarly priced Corsair 4000D airflow, I say this case takes the cake with the 4000D getting a ~7.5/10 and this case getting a ~8.5/10. This case is more general than Vetroo's other cheaper options which is good. There's room for improvement with little cost to them. Personally, after a year, I would expect a V.2 of this case with some good improvements for 10-20$ more. Mostly with the aforementioned vertical gpu mount option sold separately, a front intake filter, better hhd mounting options, an option to change out the front for glass, and an option to make the IO to be moved to the top of the case.<br /><br />Overall - I highly recommend this case over the competition unless there's a feature you absolutely have to have that this case doesn't have.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+ppVUu1vL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+ppVUu1vL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+ppVUu1vL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615qnVBxgsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615qnVBxgsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615qnVBxgsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617GFftkHoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617GFftkHoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617GFftkHoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dzgjjE1tL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dzgjjE1tL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dzgjjE1tL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aQ1V4g7eL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aQ1V4g7eL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aQ1V4g7eL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wz9irE6dL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wz9irE6dL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wz9irE6dL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71y3-ywicrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71y3-ywicrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71y3-ywicrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BCFYDQWZ,B0BGR2N81Y,AHYSJYWO6U44RIRRXGLPWIKN2QPQ,2023-01-15 18:25:43.060,3,True,500
500315,3,Very Good Backup Solution for Windows and Mac,"I ordered to backup my files on my Mac. I had to set up to mount this external HDD for my Macbook Air. There are 3 categories that I wanted to comment on: durability, software and hardware compatibility, and portability.<br />1st is durability - I would say it looks sturdy, but time will tell if this external portable HDD from Western Digital will lasts for many years to come. I would say this product is great for backup solutions on many categories instead of relying a cloud to store your data, files that are important to you. You actually bring it with you, if you want security.<br />2nd  is software and hardware compatibility - So I have a MacBook air and wanted to back up my files into this Western Digital HDD EasyStore. The name implies for NTS format that is compatible with Windows, so its a plug and play for Windows users. Highly recommend for Windows users. Also buy as much storage you can afford for your budget! That's all I can say. 4/5.<br />As for the Mac user, there is a separate user software that is 3rd party which you have to install. Or you can choose free software to mount this drive into a Mac compatible. It is not user friendly in my opinion. A free mounting HDD software is performs easily and its functionality is user friendly to users who just want to mount their HDD with one click of a button that does everything rather than go to your System Preferences > Privacy and Security in 4 steps. But I was able to because I know how to do it. But for other users, who cannot figure this out and resort to Support Help Center will have problems. 3.2/5.<br />3rd is portability - I would say it measures what is has been described on the product listing. It looks sturdy and is well built as a physical product. I haven't tried dropping it, but if you have a case. and labelled it to organize your digital files. Then yes! 4/5.<br />Budget, as storage space has become little cheaper like 5TB for $138. I would say it's cheaper! You will probably find better deals outside of Amazon. Just wait for sales on electronics after January! I trust Western Digital for its durability, portability and update my files in a very big storage solution. Please take care of your HDD which are like books inside your personal or professional workplace in the digital world. 5/5.",[],B0818C9QQJ,B0818C9QQJ,AHIUJ6ORMQ5NRLUA2F6XSYYWWMYA,2023-01-22 02:54:09.135,0,True,500
300303,3,Does What It Says It Does . . .  Track A Face. . . But Maybe Too Well,"This face tracking device is VERY good at recognizing a face, and keeping it centered in the frame.  There's no need for any additional app.  It's self contained.  Just turn it on, and it will recognize the face in front of it, and track that face during the course of fairly natural movement within a 360 degree range.  It will both rotate as you move, and also tilt to keep the face in the center of the built-in recognition camera.  The phone is mounted on top of the tilting base and clamped tight using a thumb screw to close the cushion lined clamp.  This helps to prevent the phone from slipping out during use.  This is really designed for a single person video recording (or streaming) where the person is either remaining stationary or moving within a somewhat limited distance, around the base.  Here is where the limitations of this device really show up.  You can't really step back away from, or close to, the base too far too fast, since it has no ability to adjust your camera focus or zoom.  This is why the movements have to be both natural and somewhat controlled.  The face tracking of this device works so well that it is actually a liability to the product.  Since it works so hard to keep the tracked face in the center of the screen, it's extremely difficult to try to move over to something that you might want to show in your video or stream.  Even trying to step backward to fit some prop in the camera view still doesn't work well, because it will still adjust the rotation and tilt to keep the face in the center of the camera.  And good luck if there is a second face that is present in the viewing space.  It's not feasible at all for conducting a two person interview, again because it will center on the tracked face.  So there is actually a very limited value to this device, based on the limitations of its own technology.  It also awkwardly centers the face vertically, as well.  So often there is a weird camera angle with extra space showing above the person's head.  It doesn't really help to stand up, or even place it on a tripod, to try to change the angle of the phone camera to accommodate.  Maybe requiring no app at all to allow for the user to establish some functional adjustments, isn't really the best idea.  An app may just be the answer to address these issues.",[],B0BMVDQ3WN,B0BX9FCWF4,AFOTPDE33NZPFLXKZYIKIE5RG54A,2023-04-16 06:20:50.022,0,False,500
54178,5,Low cost but great quality!!,"[[VIDEOID:da1e992d102a455ed13ddb94b4f84bd]] I usually wear over the ear headphones but wanted to get some extra earbuds/pods to always keep in my bag or pocket. I didn’t want to spend the $ on AAP because I was worried about losing them, or even liking the way they fit. I thought I’d buy a few different pair and see how I liked them before making a decision. After looking through all the reviews and products, I settled on these Gunatagy Earpbuds. They fit nicely in my ear and I don’t have issues w them falling out or feeling funny. They arrived already charged and paired instantly upon opening the case and setting them up using Bluetooth on my phone. The earbuds blink red and green to show they’re pairing. I don’t have any issues w losing Bluetooth connection either. It’s very reliable. The amount of power in the case is shown on the front as well as each individual earbud so you’ll always know how much juice you have. The case-like a pod-is also very small and can fit in any pocket. I found the volume to be sufficient for both music and talking although the bass is not overly deep. I didn’t have any problems w my voice being heard on the other end or picking up too much of the noise around me. The sound is also very crisp and clear. Navigating the taps for direction is very simple and the earbuds respond w out needing too much or too little pressure so you won’t have to worry you’ll accidentally swipe it and mess up your song or call. I’m very happy w my new earbuds and would recommend them to anyone looking for something sufficient to AAP but don’t want to break the bank... or even use from it. These are for you! You can buy yourself multiple pairs of these, have many to keep in various pockets or bags, lose one and not feel too bad and still have saved yourself a good chunk of $! Definitely recommend especially for kids whom lose and break things pretty easily. But I suggest getting yourself 2 so you won’t be swiping your kids to use all the time.<br /><br />I’ll update this review w pertinent info as I get used to them.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612MYhsGQwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612MYhsGQwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612MYhsGQwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61n2-qdYvKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61n2-qdYvKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61n2-qdYvKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BKQGQWHN,B0BKQGQWHN,AFWLDE374GYDP7Z4EH5NVALYNHIQ,2023-02-09 04:55:49.080,0,False,500
702023,2,No better than antennas half the price,"Pros:<br />Easy to set up and connect<br />Relatively well-built but I would question the durability outside on a rooftop<br />Works great with local channels<br /><br />Cons:<br />Doesn't come close to receiving stated range (85 miles) in suburban environment<br />No better reception than antennas costing 1/2 to 1/3 the price<br /><br />I’ve been trying to find an antenna that would receive 5 stations in a neighboring city where the broadcast towers are 40 miles away. I tried several types of antennas from a Yagi, all-in-one units like this, and even a traditional uhf/vhf antenna. None of them would get consistently good reception. So I thought I’d try this “Tesla” of all-in-one antennas before I spent several hundred dollars to have an antenna and amplifier professionally mounted on the roof of my suburban home.<br /><br />This unit performed no better that the antennas costing half the price. I’m technically literate and have been at this for over a year. I accessed the station list I should be able to receive from the FCC website that shows all the stations in the area, the direction and distance of the broadcast tower, and the reception strength I should expect at my house (in dbuV/m). I have a high-end TV that shows the exact signal strength percent and the amount of interference, so I can objectively compare different antennas.<br /><br />Unless you enjoy overpaying for an antenna, do not buy this product. I purchased two other antennas that were half the price that resulted in the same signal strength and level of interference as this one. I sent them back too because they didn’t receive the channels I needed.<br /><br />Note that while most HDTV stations broadcast on UHF frequencies, there are a few that broadcast on HI-V (hi VHF). Check the list from the FCC website for your area and if there are channels listed as HI-V, you’ll need an antenna that receives those frequencies (30 MHz – 300 MHz). This antenna has that capability, but the reception range is really poor.<br /><br />I’d rate the maximum usable range in a suburban/urban environment, mounted outside, at 30 miles. For attic or inside mounts expect less.",[],B07YTYH8KP,B07YTYH8KP,AH7GA47QT7D5K73LEBPBRHGE6AJQ,2023-01-10 22:39:48.344,0,True,500
781761,5,MUCH more powerful alternative to Raspberry Pi 4,"This is a fully functional desktop PC albeit closer to the level of a Raspberry Pi 4 than a Gaming PC. The Celeron N5105 quad core processor in this is VERY capable especially for this price. Great for every day internet browsing, watching 4k movies, and some retro gaming or even very light weight modern gaming. Even when the CPU was being stressed during gaming, the fan would stay super quiet and could only hear it if I put my ear near the computer.<br /><br />## Games Tested ##<br />While I would highly recommend using Batocera for retro gaming, I first tested games out of the box running Windows 11 and then adjusted settings as needed.<br /><br />- Wii Emulation via Dolphin: Any game I threw at it worked extremely well out of the box with few slow downs here and there. Changing the settings to us a Vulkan backend made everything buttery smooth 100% speed at native resolution.<br /><br />- N64 Emulation via Mupen64: I played GoldenEye since it's such a classic and generally a more demanding game to emulated and had no issues.<br /><br />- Final Fantasy XIV: Using the low settings at 1366x768 resolution allowed me to play the game but was usually around 20 FPS. While this is not ideal, it was still usable<br /><br />- Minecraft: Very playable at 1366x768 with consistent framerate of around 25 FPS.<br /><br />## Home Server ##<br />Since this processor supports virtualization, this works as a perfect Proxmox server and run Home Assistant server for automation. You can also attach an inexpensive 2.5"" SATA drive to the detachable expansion bay and use it as a NAS as I was able to get full gigabit network speed when transferring files across my home network.<br /><br />## Overall ##<br />This is an amazing little computer that's perfect as a HTPC, retro gaming pc, a home server, or even just a light weight desktop. At this price point, the closest competitor would be a Raspberry Pi 4 when adding a case, adapters, and power but this Celeron N5105 powered mini PC is vastly more powerful and capable since it can run any regular Windows program. Also worth noting that I was able to use a USB-C to DC 12v cable to power this computer via my laptop charger.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51dmQYE-BHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51dmQYE-BHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51dmQYE-BHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NI5LPvn3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NI5LPvn3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NI5LPvn3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7110WEBrtOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7110WEBrtOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7110WEBrtOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717DD8YFv-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717DD8YFv-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717DD8YFv-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gLiOQ41sL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gLiOQ41sL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gLiOQ41sL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BNJ63QGL,B0BNJ63QGL,AHPBMTPZSCLKILV4G62XZE4FC4TA,2023-01-03 02:50:29.040,2,False,500
160629,4,"Holds a charge for the whole night, but not a lot of adjustability","I got this sleep mask to replace an older one that doesn’t hold much of charge anymore. I use these mainly if I’m travelling or going on a retreat where I want to block out noise when others are staying up late and making noise even while trying to stay quiet.<br /><br />I play white noise from several different apps on my phone (there are so many free apps, no need to buy one, just try a bunch).<br /><br />At first, it took a bit to figure out how it works (the instructions are not helpful and are a poor output from Google-Translate)_ but I finally managed to get it to work.<br /><br />I like the floral print, and it's comfortable enough -- about like any sleep mask with a speaker.<br /><br />It can tend to be slightly uncomfortable if I’m sleeping on my side, though. I have to twist it around some so the speaker is not digging into the side of my head. These do hold a charge for the whole night so that is a big plus. The ones I had been using were shutting off after about 5 hours -- and of course when that happens I wake up immediately.<br /><br />The biggest issue with this is its size and the strap that connects it together to encircle my head. It must have been designed for someone with a much larger head because, when I put it on the smallest strap setting that it can go to, there's no Velcor at the point where it fits my head, but I was able to fold the strap and staple a loop to make it smaller. I'll probably cut it to remove a few inches off the strap and then sew it back together, but it would be nice if I didn't have to, because they could have just made a little buckle or something to take up the excess length.<br /><br />With my DIY hack to get it to fit, it works okay at keeping the light out and getting the speakers aligned so that the music/sound is where it needs to be. The staple is only temporary until I have time for some sewing, but it works . . . for now.<br /><br />Overall, a good rating on the battery life, but dropping a star because of the limited range of adjustment -- especially if you have a smaller head.

252944,5,A fabulous reincarnation of the Logitech Trackman Wheel,"I have spent the last five years looking for a replacement for my old Logitech Trackman Wheel mouse (the silver grey unit in the photos). While I purchased a Logitech M575, which is considered a successor to the Trackman Wheel, I never felt it was either as good or as reliable as the original wired Trackman. The connectivity was always subject to interruption and the thing just ""felt"" different. I tried a variety of other trackballs, both wired and wireless, and all of them had some deficiency. Mostly, the manufacturers, in an effort to differentiate their product from the others, diddled with the ergonomics in significant ways--changing the height, angle or orientation of the trackball, altering the width or height of the entire unit, etc.<br /><br />This trackball from NULEA (the darker unit in the photos) is the closest I have come to the old Trackman Wheel and I am delighted! The feel is the same and the NULEA has significant improvements from both the wired Trackman Wheel and the M575 replacement, in particular, adjustable cursor speed, multiple connectivity methods (two bluetooth channels and wireless USB via an included USB dongle),  and backward and forward keys to the left of the left side button.<br /><br />Note that the NULEA unit differs from most wireless mice in that it has a rechargeable battery that must be recharged via a USB-C connector. A full charge takes two hours. I have not yet operated this device long enough to require a recharge but I suspect several weeks of daily use will be about average. My approach will be to plug it in at night once every two weeks and not worry about it.<br /><br />Also note that the unit has a black rectangular button immediately above the track wheel. This adjusts the cursor speed and there are 5 levels---100-200-400-800-1200. 100 is a crawl and 1200 is lightning fast. This is a wonderful improvement since, between selecting a cursor speed on the mouse itself and adjusting acceleration in the operating system settings, one can get exactly the cursor speed they are comfortable with.<br /><br />A final note of caution. The manual says that the NULEA unit is not suitable for gaming. I am not a gamer so cannot address this but take the manufacturer at their word.<br /><br />I really recommend this device. It's great!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715NbxWpIML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715NbxWpIML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715NbxWpIML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71VD8UOze1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71VD8UOze1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71VD8UOze1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09HHHDZZG,B09Y544F2V,AGFRP3M2I6X2HX477IW27REGPX6Q,2023-01-29 01:32:22.709,14,True,500
10618,5,Sturdy rising platform with 3 height levels - no assembly required!,"With folks working from home so much and many of them using their dining room tables as their work desk for their laptop/notebook, we often don't exactly have ergonomically designed chairs at the dining room table.  Even if you do, sometimes not only does standing up feel good vs. sitting all day, but it's much better for your back being slouched over constantly.  This rising desk does the job for when you want to work on you laptop for a bit while standing.<br /><br />No assembly required!  Take it out of the box and it's ready to go.  It comes out folded flat and all you need to do is place it on your work area.  You can actually leave it at that folded level if you want to work sitting now and standing later.  When you're ready to rise it up to stand, it is all controlled with this single lever on the right.  Push it downward and you'll be able to raise the table up.  Let go of the lever and it will latch on to one of the three height settings to match what height is good for you.  I measured from the table you will place this on, to the top of the rising table and it shows the three heights:  8.5"", just under 11"" and highest is 12.5"".  When you're done , push down on that level again, raise the table up a little and you'll be able to lower it down.  It's really simple to use.<br /><br />This thing is very sturdy.  There is very little play when you place anything on the table but it's built to be very stable, which it has to be.  Therefore, it is not light, so be careful with the base which is made of metal and trying to life it carelessly.  I accidentally caught my finger on the corner of the base of the table  somehow and gave myself a tiny little blood blister.  The base does have 4 felt pads to keep it from slipping. but it doesn't give any real rise to the base to give you a grip to lift it off the table.  So, just be careful with that.<br /><br />Otherwise, there is very little else to say other than this was more than enough space for my Surface Pro.  It does exactly what it was designed for and it does not feel cheap.  I'm very happy with it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41qWsmJPfSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41qWsmJPfSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41qWsmJPfSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515jG1ZuMEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515jG1ZuMEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515jG1ZuMEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51gWeV3i+jL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51gWeV3i+jL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51gWeV3i+jL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-cC0I+WoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-cC0I+WoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-cC0I+WoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6113OJeshOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6113OJeshOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6113OJeshOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61GoSZc5IzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61GoSZc5IzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61GoSZc5IzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BD4HKNLZ,B0C6FBDP63,AE4PSO2Y7RKHQVEW6DHX3IWMS4TQ,2023-02-04 16:51:57.703,0,False,500

806395,4,Small and portable but mighty and powerful,"EDIT: gonna dock this one star off, weather's getting warmer so I brought out my small desk fan out of storage, got some dust on it.  It Barelyyy took off some dust more specifically off the blades. Still had to open it up, it's not like the dust was hard simply wipe with a paper towel and it came out.<br />I know if I had the can of air with that little red straw it definitely would've of got in there and blown the dust away. What I stated before is still the same maybe a different attachment nozzle would've of done better. For the high price of $60, I would expect a little more. It's a tiny desk fan and it wouldn't remove the dust.<br /><br />Came with a nice storage cloth, and only a few  nozzle attachments, wish it bought more 'nozzles' possibly a very narrow one for tougher spaces. When comparing other brands I see they include a wider variety of nozzles for the about the same price or less.<br />4 power modes each increasing in power.<br />I placed my pixel 6 phone case side to side for a size comparison. If you're looking for portability or easily being able to be stored away this is the one. Cleaned my keyboard and it removed hair, bigger dust bunnies and just grime that gets in there in general.<br />I would say it removed 80% of the dust just fine but the smaller particles that have been sitting won't come out (probably because I have never cleaned my keyboard)<br />You will need to dig deeper possibly remove some key caps to get it 100% clean, but that's where the brush attachment comes in handy to help you get as much as possible. I really don't see much use cases for this FOR ME PERSONALLY, I will probably only use this for cleaning my keyboard and PC which I like to clean at least twice a year. This will make it much easier.<br />I compared prices with other compressed air devices and this seems to be on par more or less with the others. Some slightly cheaper but this one looks of better quality. For the price it seems a bit high, if they bought more nozzles it would be better, but it does what it's supposed to at around similar price compared to others.<br />Also you don't have to buy cans of compressed air anymore assuming this product has longevity.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71T075LTvIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71T075LTvIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71T075LTvIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71r-qHf-hBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71r-qHf-hBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71r-qHf-hBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BQ3612G2,B0BQ3612G2,AE3C2BOVTTK3MZ4IFF5FXSOKMSXA,2023-02-19 22:36:30.282,0,False,500
470108,4,"Nice Product That Works, Just A Few Quirks","This review will only speak to Android Auto use as I don't have an Apple phone and did not use Carplay.<br /><br />One concern I had when ordering the Ottocast was whether it would work with my head unit since the product description seemed to imply it only works with OEM radios and not after market. I have a Boss BV800ACP and it works perfectly with this after market head unit. I imagine it will work with many others.<br /><br />The product is a very nice size, approximately the size of a credit card, so it's easy to stash somewhere out of the way. It's very easy to use, just plug it into the OEM port where you would normally plug your phone in to connect to Android Auto. You pair it with your phone and you're done. Easy peasy. The USB C port that you plug into to interface with your radio is recessed (see photo) into an oval shaped hole that is small and restricts the use of many different cables so you have to use the cable provided unless you happen to have one that fits. WHY RECESS THIS PORT IN A HOLE???!!!<br /><br />Another quirk, the Android Auto screen seems ever so slightly smaller than the screen I use when connected directly to my head unit via a cable. It's barely noticeable, but it's there. Not a deal breaker by any means.<br /><br />Another disappointment I have is that I still have occasional Android Auto crashes. My hope was that with switching to a wireless connection, this issue would go away. It has not. I may try a different USB cable if I can find another one that will fit that stupid hole. The Android Auto crashes are certainly NOT the fault of this product, but if you're thinking your crashing issues will be a thing of the past, they won't be.<br /><br />Last, but not least, my boot up times have doubled because now I have to wait for my head unit to boot and THEN wait for the Ottocast to pair and boot up. It all happens automatically so it's not a big deal to me.<br /><br />Overall, I do love the convenience of not having to plug my phone in or unplug it when I leave my car. The Ottocast does work well overall. If you decide to purchase it though, beware your cable selection will be very limited to connect it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MsHYdjdCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MsHYdjdCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MsHYdjdCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZygCPRi-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZygCPRi-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZygCPRi-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hBU50L-EL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hBU50L-EL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hBU50L-EL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jtHwG0eRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jtHwG0eRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jtHwG0eRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716eWE9iH5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716eWE9iH5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716eWE9iH5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BG4RVSRB,B0BG4RVSRB,AGSDEQS55YP3VOLCYQMORXRON2EA,2023-01-18 02:59:41.408,0,False,500
461144,5,High-quality board. Appears to be fully compatible with standard Nano. Reasonable price.,"This is the second MCU board I’ve ordered that was made by Osoyoo. The first was based around a LGT8F328P processor and I was very pleased with the quality and the performance of that. This board purports to be compatible with an Arduino Nano V3.<br /><br />The product arrived nicely packaged in an attractive cardboard box with the board inside wrapped in an antistatic plastic pouch. The board had been positioned sideways in the box which helped stop it moving around in transit and, importantly, help prevent it from being crushed. A 0.5m USB-A to USB-C cable was also supplied. This board has a USB-C socket which is preferable to the USB Mini-B sockets used on most other Nano boards. The header pins are already soldered onto the board – which is a great bonus for users who don’t like or don’t want to solder these things on or don’t have a soldering iron.<br /><br />The board components and their layout are almost identical to the official Arduino Nano and most of its clones. The big difference is the inclusion of a small IC labeled “6627” (see photo). It’s not clear what this does but it seems to be something to do with power management or VREF for the ADC.<br /><br />In use, it worked perfectly. I installed it in a pressure and temperature logging monitor I had develeoped using a standard Nano for use with beer kegs. This circuit utilizes most of the capabilities of an Arduino Nano – I2C, SPI, OneWire, analog in, SD read/write, EEPROM and interrupts. This board from Osoyoo worked well. The only issue I had was with the green power LED on the board – it was intense and hurt my eyes!<br /><br />Note that no instructions are provided with the product. However, there is a huge amount of information on the internet for a standard Nano device and they should all apply to this one, too.<br /><br />This is a high-quality device and is sold a lot cheaper than the official Nano board but is more expensive than a lot of other clones – however it does come ready-soldered and with a connecting cable. I could find no issues with its operation or performance (apart from a very intense power LED).","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JHUNmYG4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JHUNmYG4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JHUNmYG4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JwCciWLtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JwCciWLtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JwCciWLtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pZF3famYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pZF3famYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pZF3famYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BW3YLW1B,B0BY1L79NT,AGDQOLA3BFA3SYZZZRBNTCT45IAA,2023-03-17 16:00:06.004,0,False,500
474626,4,Good alternative to the official Apple keyboard folio,"PROS:<br />- Less than half the price of the official Apple Magic Keyboard Folio<br />- Good quality keys 'feel' good, not cheap feeling<br />- Added bulk of the case is acceptable<br />- Apple pencil holder<br />- Backlit keys<br />- Nice to show the battery percentage left for the keyboard<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Even though it's cheaper, it's still expensive for what it is. ESR is simply taking advantage of Apple's exorbitant price. There is no guarantee the next iPad will fit this case.<br />- Minimal angle adjustment of the iPad. You get either perfectly straight up/down up to maybe a 10-15 degree tilt max. It's fine most of the time, but would have preferred a little more adjustment.<br /><br />NOT REALLY CONS for me but had to mention:<br />- The top number row and the QWERTY row below it are too evenly aligned, it's a little awkward<br />- Keyboard seems to fall asleep when it wants. Waking it up requires pushing a key, touching the trackpad doesn't wake it.<br />- Keyboard battery life drops faster than I would expect<br />- Turning the keyboard on/off is awkward because the iPad sits right above it. The button is simply a tap, not a physical push button. So there's not much room for your finger.<br />- The official keyboard has dedicated row for adjusting things like brightness, media controls, etc. This keyboard does not have those at all.<br /><br />Miscellaneous observations:<br /><br />Someone mentioned in another review that the trackpad can only be physically pushed in order to click on things. This is untrue. Tap to click can be enabled by going into 'Setting > General > Trackpad > Tap to click'  This made the trackpad about 100% more usable as it was definitely annoying having to physically push the trackpad to click things. I think that's more of an issue with iOS simply not being that great with a mouse/trackpad. There are more settings in Accessibility that I had to tweak in order to make using the trackpad more usable. I disabled trackpad inertia and pointer animations in 'Settings > Accessibility > Pointer Control'. This made the trackpad behave more like a trackpad on regular laptops.",[],B0BP1JDYFJ,B0C39X83JR,AHSRQSDZ5RP32MB3ROGKJJNJCHUQ,2023-03-10 03:49:17.895,2,True,500
515501,3,"Switches between two computers (with limits), no power supply","I got this to better manage two machines I use for work. Having two monitors, I wanted a KVM that supported that. The USB switching works fine (I hooked that up first as I forgot to bring in the 'extra' HDMI cables to connect the computer video outputs up) when no video is connected. There's no power supply for this - which is actually kinda nice since outlets always seem to be in short supply - and the wired switch seems well designed to stay where you want it on a flat surface (the bottom is a rubber-type material that stays put). The switch has a solid click feel to it so you know you've actually triggered it and the case is a nice metal (powder-coated?). After connecting up the HDMI cables I was unable to get either the keyboard or my cordless mouse to work. When I tried a simple USB wired mouse and keyboard I was still unable to get a working mouse or keyboard. Apparently the lack of a power supply has its downsides. If you are OK with either the video switching (and having to set back up your windows after a switch), or the keyboard and mouse switching, this isn't a bad unit - nice small form factor and no external power supply. But, if you need is a switch that will allow you to connect both systems with keyboard / mouse AND video - this thing isn't for you. Since what I mostly wanted was a way to switch the keyboard and mouse (and not the displays) I guess I'm OK with it? The video quality is good and I'm not having any issues with that, it just doesn't switch both the displays AND the keyboard & mouse. One caveat I will say is that one dock (Dell) puts out two DisplayPorts and the other dock (aftermarket) has USB-C and DisplayPort and it could be that if all the video outputs were HDMI then this would work as advertised, but since I don't have those connections, I can't judge that. I really wanted to like this unit and to have it work, but with my setup it just... doesn't. If I connect all the video inputs and outputs, the keyboard and mouse won't respond (but my keyboard still lights up?). Without any video cables connected, it works fine to switch the keyboard and mouse. If I just connect the video cables, it will switch the video. So... depending on what you want this to do, it may work for you.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71I2NNo73hL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71I2NNo73hL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71I2NNo73hL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09TVF53DN,B0BB26LX7Z,AFWJYWXSPO5LWZI2BPMNK4KVUKLQ,2023-01-05 19:07:50.096,0,False,500
523361,1,"READ ME! General Recommendations. Don't buy this, Samsung Hubs are near end of life.","Short Answer:<br /><br />V1 Hubs are already dead (bricked and useless). Who knows how long V2 and V3 ones will last.<br /><br />If you are new to home automation, just avoid this and go use something else. If you are just doing basic automation, there are many options, if you want a more advanced, programmable hub, look at Hubitat.<br /><br />If you are using Samsung SmartThings and are looking to add or replace a hub and don't run anything advanced through web core, Aeotec makes a hub that is SmartThings compatible.<br /><br />If you are like me and all of a sudden your WebCore has stopped working because Samsung killed it and you want something better than that level of programmability, check out Hubitat.<br /><br />Long Answer:<br /><br />Samsung is in the process of re-imagining their SmartThings app. They are no longer selling hubs and will likely stop supporting these soon. When I bought this nearly 3 years ago, they had a great app built into SmartThings called WebCore that allowed users create custom code driven algorithms called ""pistons"" that could do a wide variety of tasks. Two days ago, I noticed my scenes based on those pistons just stopped working. My smart house just turned into a remote controllable house. I forgot how much I had those pistons do. Anyway, I then figured out that it wasn't just a hub or some other issue and that Webcore itself is dead (killed by Samsung).<br /><br />This is unfortunate, since up until this point, this Samsung Hub had been a great product. All of this IOT is a double edged sword here in the 21st century. You can control and automate many things from the other side of the planet. However, somebody, somewhere can also push a button and hack or brick something you physically bought. In general, I try to make as much of my stuff not reliant on a service and host as much of it myself. I try to avoid the big data collectors versions of products (Amazon, Google, Apple). One thing that is nice about Hubitat, is that you can directly connect to it and it is not reliant on a service. That means it can't be bricked as easily.<br /><br />Good luck out there...","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VUgwubcLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VUgwubcLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VUgwubcLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07FJGGWJL,B07FJGGWJL,AHSSYYOWCJOG4MME7DB6EMTL243A,2023-01-13 17:49:46.904,5,True,500

I wanted something that was easy to set up & didn't require any Tech wizardry.<br /><br />After reading various reviews of systems at higher price points that offered more features that I wouldn't use (Bluetooth, multiple speakers etc.) I decided to purchase this. Shipping was fine & timely, set up was also thank fully easy took less than 10 mins.<br /><br />After playing around with the settings on the Signa 2 remote for a bit I picked the settings I liked and used the Roku remote to run the TV after that. Changing setting on the Signa remote is very easy if you switch to a movie or music.<br /><br />There are 3 settings for voice adjustments, I was surprised by how much difference there are between them. I watch a lot of anime and changing between the three really highlighted the difference. On the highest setting the voices are much clearer and more of the background sounds are suppressed.<br /><br />Likewise the movie setting is very different & you will get a much better overall sound experience with it on when watching movies.<br /><br />The only real problem is the sound control, while my Roku remote moves the sound volume up & down one number at a time the Signa S2 once it is connected overrides the Roku remote from an audio perspective and adjusts the volume up or down in increments of 3...odd but I have not found a way to change it after several months of use.<br /><br />At lower volume levels its not so bad but going from 13/16/19 as your only choices in medium levels is annoying.

808469,4,Oh So Close,"I am looking for a replacement for my 3rd (or maybe 4th) Microsoft Sculpt keyboard which all quit working after a couple of years because the membrane keys can't hold up to my heavy fast typing. Also I wanted to get a mechanical keyboard like the original Microsoft Natural Keyboard because as nice as the ergonomics of the Sculpt is, the membrane keyboard is very mushy with minimal feedback.<br /><br />One other feature I was hoping to find was a split keyboard that put some type of cursor controller, either a trackpoint, trackball, or maybe even a small trackpad with left/right mouse keys below it in the otherwise wasted blank space between the two halves of the keyboard. That just seems like such a natural thing to do with that unused space on a one piece split keyboard. My laptop has a trackpoint and I really like using it the times when I use my laptop away from my desk because I don't have to move my hands off the keyboard. The trouble of course with the laptop keyboard is that other than the trackpoint it has absolutely horrible ergonomics that make my hands ache and cramp after just an hour or so of typing.<br /><br />Also with a way to control the cursor with just a slight shift of my hands on the keyboard to the controllers in the middle, I could finally finally go back to a keyboard with an integrated 10-key, which is so much faster when entering lots of numbers in a spreadsheet, rather than the compact ones like the Sculpt. This is because a full size keyboard puts my mouse too far to the right and by the end of the day my right shoulder aches from the very unergonomic position of the mouse.<br /><br />So when scrolling through the ""ergonomic"" split keyboards with mechanical keys here on Amazon, I thought I had found the one that I was looking for from the initial image for this keyboard with some type of controls positioned in the gap. Sadly no. The keys in the space between are just a set of multimedia keys. Sigh.<br /><br />If anybody from ProtoArc is reading this, you are missing out on a game changing feature (IMHO) to make the entire typing AND cursor control process highly ergonomic rather than making just the typing part better while making the cursor control part less ergonomic.

393432,2,You can't realistically use the mouse while it is active,"[[VIDEOID:a6c8915a1679fb392ec1935a80a1c946]] I purchased this mouse jiggler hoping that I could leave it plugged in, and that it would provide a very small, almost imperceptible movement of 1 pixel every 5 to 10 minutes. Basically enough to keep the computer from falling asleep, but not enough to cause me to click on the wrong thing or distract me.<br /><br />Wow, was I wrong.<br /><br />You plug this jiggler USB into your computer's USB port, and you can turn it on by holding the button on the front. As soon as it turns on, your mouse cursor starts rotating in a small circle. The movement is constant and not subtle at all, going around an area about the size of a single desktop icon. Not only does it move constantly, but it also drifts towards the side of the screen in the process. So after a few seconds, your mouse cursor won't be visible anymore. You can take control of the mouse again by moving it physically, but unless you are constantly moving it, it will start rotating again. There are 2 other settings, and it only gets worse form there. The second setting causes the mouse to move around in a much larger circle, about the size of 1/4 of the screen. It completes 1 circle within the same amount of time, so it is very rapidly moving and it looks like it is jumping around. The final setting is so eratic that the cursor just appears to be randomly flashing across the entire screen.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars (instead of 1) is that technically it does work, and it should keep your computer from falling asleep when it is turned on. But instead of something subtle running in the background, it is very disruptive of mouse function while it is turned on. It is something you would need to actively switch on and off when you step away from your computer. I don't know about you, but that kind of defeats the purpose, since I often stand up not expecting to be away from my computer for more than a few moments. It might be useful to you, such as in a situation where you need to plug it in, turn it on, and immediately walk away from the computer. But I threw it straight in the trash as soon as I realized how wild the movement was. 2 stars.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RTYmVk2UL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RTYmVk2UL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RTYmVk2UL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hSl3mLZLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hSl3mLZLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hSl3mLZLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ns97ZpW1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ns97ZpW1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ns97ZpW1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BP2GRPGT,B0BP2GRPGT,AFBYBJXJBZNBPIJ4QBLYYS3V3CYQ,2023-02-15 17:40:18.077,0,False,500

980545,3,Good Product Marred by Outdated Labeling,"I’ve been using computers since the 70s when storage drives of this size didn’t even exist and a 5MB (not GB) might cost you $5,000.<br /><br />Here we have a 128GB USB flash drive for $19 or so.<br /><br />We’ve got a winner, right?<br /><br />Well, sort of.  If you don’t mind traveling back a few years – quite a few.<br /><br />First clue?  The box states several operating systems long relegated to antique shops such as Windows Me, Vista, 2000, Me and NT.<br /><br />Wow!  I can finally fire up that relic Compaq PC I discovered at the garage sale!<br /><br />But the ad does state USB 3.0, so why should I complain?<br /><br />Because it comes delivered in a package that states nothing to that effect.  Plus, those operating systems mentioned above didn’t allow the 3.0 standard because it wasn’t around yet; however, to be fair anything marked USB 3.0 is backward compatible with 2.0 and 1.0.<br /><br />On the plus side, it looks nice, holds a lot and comes with a nice lanyard ring for hanging on bulletin boards, etc.  In addition, since it’s a single piece unit (except for the ring) you don’t have caps to get lost.<br /><br />As for capacity, it states 128GB but shows 119GB when I checked.  Slightly over 8GB was reserved for some drivers.  I wasn’t interested in checking them out so I formatted the drive and now it holds 128GB.<br /><br />So, is it truly USB 3.0?  So far, from what I can tell, yes it is.  An easy way to tell?<br /><br />Look at the open end that plugs into your PC.  If the tab is white, it’s 1.0.  Black is 2.0 and blue is 3.0.<br /><br />This drive does work, looks nice, has an lanyard instead of a cap and that earns it 3 stars.  I dropped a couple only because the packaging needs a good deal of updating.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71X9lJ9B2AL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71X9lJ9B2AL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71X9lJ9B2AL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BQR13VVM,B0BQR13VVM,AGETO7PKRPKSR72WUUCI4LACVVTA,2023-02-01 16:38:44.758,1,False,500
345889,5,Great audio with good soundstage and imaging. Perfect for FPS games.,"Comfort:<br />Disclaimer: I have a large head and large ears that stick out. My ears do touch the inside driver wall just barely enough to cause discomfort and pain after a couple hours of wearing these. I have ""fixed"" or modified them so that my ears do not touch. Now they are comfy and make me happy ^_^<br /><br />Sound:<br />These are open backs. They have no sound isolation. Do not get these if you are going to use them in a noisy environment or if you are going to bother others because they will be able to hear what you hear. If you're in a room and alone then these will be great for you as the sound ""leakage"" is not so drastic that the sound would go through walls or a room with a closed door. These are not speakers. Just wanted to get that out there.<br /><br />They are tuned to be more neutral. If you like a lot of bass then these are not for you. They have bass and they respond really well to EQ adjustments but they are, by default, tuned neutral.<br />They are terrific for gaming IMO. The bass is clear and quick and does not muddy the mids or interfere with the mids at all. This is perfect for trying to listen for footsteps or other audio cues within games.<br /><br />They are easy to drive or power off motherboard audio jacks. I have an Aorus Elite WiFi motherboard and the onboard audio easily drives this headphone. I just recently bought a Fiio K5 Pro amp/DAC and have them plugged into that and they sound pretty good.<br /><br />I am impressed with the soundstage, imaging, and clarity of this headphone. In BF2042, I can easily hear enemies as they're running around a base or cap area. They produce sound quickly so even with intense firefights these don't get messy or jumbled at all. They produce each and every sound and move onto the next sound without issue. This is huge for those firefights where bombs, gunfire, magazine reloads, footsteps, vehicles, and everything is happening all at once.<br /><br />This headphone offers a lot of performance and great sounding audio for their price point. Nothing really competes with them except maybe the DT 990 Pro 80 ohm. Those have more bass but the 560S I find better at speed and clarity.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oCbhFiIXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oCbhFiIXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oCbhFiIXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712wYPrzGXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712wYPrzGXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712wYPrzGXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PIwoS+s1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PIwoS+s1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PIwoS+s1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dgZVJWgYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dgZVJWgYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dgZVJWgYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08J9MVB6W,B08J9MVB6W,AF2WXHS26QWP6MBJIS4UCT5TFZLQ,2023-03-20 21:39:42.169,4,True,500
637722,4,"Well made for the price, and the coax physically is exactly as advertised.","This is by all indications a well-made jumper, exactly as advertised. I took mine apart to get a better idea of the quality, and here's what I found.<br /><br />First, it arrived coiled up as in the attached photo. I don't care for the tight bend in the cable on the end with the SMA connector. They didn't do that to the end with the BNC connector, so there wasn't a need to do that  to the other end.<br /><br />The connectors at each end are crimped on and each end is protected with a significant length of heat-shrink. It is thick and very tough, providing some additional strain relief on the crimp connection as well as protection. Underneath the heat shrink was the crimp connection. On inspection I would describe the quality of the crimp as between good to very good. It's not as good as the crimps on some high-quality jumpers I have, but it's more than suitable for the intended purpose.<br /><br />I stripped off some of the PVC jacket (very thick and tough) and found a very good tinned braid underneath. Under the braid the dielectric was coated with an adhesive foil, just as advertised. The center conductor is solid copper.<br /><br />Overall it appears to be a very good jumper for the price. I can't comment on how long the cable will last (coax does wear out), but it seems to be well made with good coax and connectors. The jumper is not advertised as being suitable for outdoor use; I would say this is good for indoor use and temporary outdoor use as long as it's not subjected to rain or similar. I will certainly be able to get some use from this around my Amateur Radio station.<br /><br />My only major concern with this jumper is the lack of labeling on the coax itself. The only thing the coax has on it is its type (RG8X) and the fact that it's low-loss (see picture). And a number. All good jumpers are made with coax that has a lot of information printed on it, including things like the manufacturer, information about the jacket, and possibly thermal and electrical properties of the cable. This coax is probably just fine, but if the company wants to really win the respect of the techie types, the coax should provide more information on it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51IYwfFaE-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51IYwfFaE-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51IYwfFaE-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51MtbfddHIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51MtbfddHIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51MtbfddHIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QugDpEPdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QugDpEPdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QugDpEPdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61773rkWmzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61773rkWmzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61773rkWmzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618muEnur7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618muEnur7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618muEnur7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XCEzkRyQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XCEzkRyQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XCEzkRyQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gvN+nO4VL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gvN+nO4VL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gvN+nO4VL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BG28M4GJ,B0BJZN7BGY,AGB3MM7AQS2IHFBKKWIAWYFQZ3RA,2023-02-04 03:04:27.096,0,False,499
989353,4,"Great sound quality, unique look, solid IP rating, mixed battery life | Comparison Review","I got two different pairs of bone conduction headphones to try.  I had wanted something not in the ear but also not over my ears.  Result of working at home and needed to be more aware of what else is happening and being able to help.  Bonetalker 10 1/2 by Sazooy was one pair and the other is the KingLucky (ASIN B0B6TSSLPL) shown in one of the images above.  I will compare both but highlight the differences mostly.<br /><br />The Bonetalker battery life is the weakest aspect IMO.  The headphones will run out of battery if you are sitting around wearing them versus exercising which brings it own time limits. KingLucky is much longer, likely due to the two large parts behind the ears.  Bone conduction headphones versus earbuds do not sound as good due to how the sound is transferred.  The Bonetalker was noticeably better of the two pairs and almost on par with some lowerend earbuds I have used.  KingLucky's sound quality is not terrable just not on par with Bonetalker.  The two pairs are very divergent in how they look, market, and even while being used.  Bonetalker is smaller but looks much more energetic.  And yes the ""monster"" you see in the box can be detached from the plastic frame and mounted to hold the Bonetalker when not being used.  KingLucky is very low key and staid in appearance so it is more a choice of your style. Bonetalker lists itself as IPX6 while KingLucky lists itself as IP55.  Bonetalker provides no dust raiting (X in IPX6) but a higher water raiting, so should be better able to stand up to exercise, rain, and other water events.  Bonetalker survived me taking a shower while KingLucky failed when I was out in a rainstorm.  KingLucky was replaced with the same product and I have been more careful about water since.  In theory, KingLucky is more ""beach"" capable since it had a dust intrusion raiting in addition to water but I have not evaluated this factor.<br /><br />Overall both pairs have pluses and minuses so it is really about the features and capabilities you are looking for to decide which is the right pair for you.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610PnShU8cL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610PnShU8cL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610PnShU8cL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SVmGss95L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SVmGss95L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SVmGss95L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HtRKywDDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HtRKywDDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HtRKywDDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hbRwWO6HL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hbRwWO6HL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hbRwWO6HL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kdWuZlPcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kdWuZlPcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kdWuZlPcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B5ZTLWCH,B0B5ZTLWCH,AFCPCCNAH2KBNUSXEOASZJ5IPDSQ,2023-03-17 04:25:59.483,0,False,499

When going through the setup process, the app had a red ""X"" through the 5gHz option, even though my WiFi is dual band.  Other than that glitch, the setup process went pretty smoothly.  I already own another camera from this manufacturer, so I already had the app and was registered.

You can set the camera to start recording when it detects motion.  If motion is detected at night, when the camera is operating in infrared (IR) mode, an option allows for a spotlight to turn on.  Like most LED spotlights, you would not want to be looking straight at it when it goes on.  When the spotlight is on, enough light is produced to allow the camera to go back into full color mode.  You can also set the camera to follow movement.  I tried walking past the camera both in daylight and in IR modem, and it automatically panned to keep me in the frame.

In other words, the laptop was brand new and clean.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I followed the video instructions and cleaned the screen twice. But it was pretty upsetting because the laptop screen looked spotless even before cleaning but these films already looked dirty and dented. I could literally see two bubbles on one of them before even beginning!<br /><br />To be fair, I think the dust and tiny hairs were likely from my home even though I swept and cleaned the desk before starting this project.

If properly protected, the screen protectors should have remained entirely clean. And neither one was. And both had scratches and were dented. Maybe Amazon shipping was to blame?<br /><br />Regardless, the plastic packaging wasn't sealed which I think is ridiculous considering how important it is for these screen protectors to be spotlessly clean.<br /><br />I gave it a go anyhow because this is what I had to work with. The results were predictably awful. In the video, the woman who's installing her screen protector ends up with only a bubble or two. Half of my screen is bubbles.

As i said Win 10 Pro was a requirement, i won't be moving to Win 11 anytime soon. I haven't had to use the sellers tech support yet (thankfully) but they responded quickly when had a question about the compatibility of my PCI Audio Interface Card.<br /><br />Aside from that the Dell Optiplex 9020 mini tower is a tooless system easy to upgrade if necessary. It came perfectly packed along with the biggest mouse pad I've ever seen (maybe desk pad would be a better description) a  great wi-fi card which worked without having to do anything except attach the bunny ears & push the button on my Router. It also comes with a decent wireless mouse/keyboard combo, so you're good to go if you need a working system & already have a monitor. A few years ago this computer would cost a couple racks. So not for nothing as long as it stays working, I'll be able to do great work with this upgraded Dell OptiPlex 9020 PC Tower.<br /><br />As of right now it's working perfectly. 10/10 will update review if anything changes.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717pqpP8d3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717pqpP8d3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717pqpP8d3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71asDKEY9hL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71asDKEY9hL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71asDKEY9hL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BGPKCR51,B0BGP1D3SW,AGAQXMVV35MTETJYS2XR5IBATENQ,2023-01-29 23:44:15.384,0,True,499
289548,3,"No integration with Sound bar, No integrated way to use USB for pause / ‘rewind’, Great picture","Pro:<br />1. Picture quality is fantastic.<br />2. The usual ‘Smart Tv’ features are built in - streaming channels, web TV, etc.<br />3.  There is some ability to customize the Smart TV Home Screen , once you figure out how to use the LG interface. It is quite ‘busy’, far more stuff on the Home Screen than is necessary. If you are not used to Smart TV’s and streaming it could be overwhelming at first.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. No built in ability to use a USB drive to have pause / rewind capability in USA (the older models used to have this enabled), there is not even a volatile 30 minute memory for this.  IGNORE documentation on the net that references Time-shift, it is NOT available on LG TV’s in the US.  This means an external product / service needs to be purchased to have the ability to pause / rewind.<br />2. The sound mode choices on the TV are disabled if you connect a sound bar.  So you either need to buy a more expensive sound bar that provides a variety of sound modes (if there are any that have this) or be satisfied with back to basic simple bass adjustment that is on most sound bars.  The TV sound without a sound bar is not very good quality, as is the case with most TV’s.  If you want versatile, great sound, an external high end sound bar will need to be purchased.<br />3.  Magic remote pointer is awful, jumpy, moves around, making selection on the screen difficult.  Learn to immediately use the arrow keys instead whenever that screen pointer shows up!  Arrow keys will disable the pointer until you press the ‘wheel’ / OK button again.<br />4.  Directions on how to find the Live TV guide are poor.  Rest assured, there IS an onscreen TV and channel guide.<br /><br />Summary -<br />The picture is fantastic.<br />There is definitely an adjustment period to get used to:  not having pause/rewind on Live TV, constantly having to disable the on-screen cursor, and not having sound mode options on my mediocre sound bar.  It will go into a spare bedroom and be replaced by a different brand when I have enough funds to make that happen.",[],B09RMFZZPX,B0B3S7JVND,AEEHLD7CURBDVEAD3VTXA7EGBNAQ,2023-02-27 17:28:54.288,1,False,499
665226,1,BEWARE SELLER WILL HARASS YOU. Worked great at the beginning…,"Edit 1/27/23: second message asking me to download a sketch file and asking me to email them outside of the amassing messaging system. I contacted amazon and was given a full refund through them. Purchased a different brand which worked better out of the box that this paperweight ever did. I’ll be reporting every single spammy harassing message I get from this company to Amazon, and if they keep messaging I’ll contact Amazon again and file a full harassment compliant.<br /><br />Edit 1/25/23: Seller sent me a message offering a full refund which I accepted. Next message? “Download this strange file then send us your email so we can update your unit” after I clearly wrote here that I flashed new firmware and it works as long as I don’t hit any bumps. Talk about a bait and switch - and asking for a purchasers email address? Nope. This company is a scam. Beware.<br /><br />Purchased last March (2022), and it worked great until about July when it started disconnecting from the phone for what appeared no reason. I unplugged it and went back to plugging in my phone directly because I was too busy at the time to try to figure out the problem.<br /><br />Recently I decided to give it another go. I plugged the unit back in to my 2021 Mazda cx-5, installed a firmware upgrade, and it reconnected to my phone right away. I figured I was back in business.<br /><br />I live in the northeast. It’s winter. There are many, many potholes. Potholes you can lose a car in. I hit a pothole and bam, CarPlay disconnected. “Bluetooth item not found” came up on the screen…then the screen showed the Bluetooth name for the unit, and then my phone reconnected. Okay…maybe a one-off…<br /><br />Nope. At this point, you whisper the wrong way and it disconnects. It’s not the wiring in the car, either. I’ve swapped back to the iPhone cord and no problems. Go back to wireless with this thing and it disconnects constantly.

390708,2,Almost useless as a security camera — cannot record continuous video,"These cameras work well, and are reasonably good for live viewing. The solar charger works surprisingly well. There are, however, flaws in the firmware that make these cameras almost useless as security cameras.<br /><br />The cameras will not record anything other than 10-second clips when motion is detected. The duration of the clip cannot be changed by the user. Also, the cameras cannot be set to record continuously. If you try to review footage, other than the 10-second clips from when the camera detected motion (which it is not very good at doing), you get a message saying “No video available at the momento.” (see image).<br /><br />It doesn’t matter if you are trying to record on the SD card or with their optional, subscription, cloud service. Continuous recording is not available at all on these cameras.<br /><br />It is possible that they designed it like this because they built these with inadequate batteries. If this is the case, the battery choice was a poor one. But even if this is the case, you should be able to use continuous recording if you supply constant power to the unit. They did not allow for that either. There is just no way to get the camera to record continuous video.<br /><br />The best you can do is set the motion-sensitivity to high, and hope that it catches important events. Most of the time it doesn’t.<br /><br />Netvue acknowledges this recording issue, but has outright stated (on their forum) that they have no intention of fixing the problem.<br /><br />One other thing that I’ve noticed is that the camera never records video of obvious movement, if I am watching the live view of it. Because it has so much trouble detecting motion, I can’t say for certain if this is a motion-detection flaw, or if it truly cannot record anything if you are watching the live stream. Either way, it makes it a pretty undesirable security camera.<br /><br />I’m hoping that Netvue will eventually take responsibility for their mistakes and fix them.<br /><br />As it is now though, buy this camera only if all you want to do is occasionally watch a live stream that you don’t need to record. If you want to be able to review footage, look at other brands.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/417vOWYibrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/417vOWYibrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/417vOWYibrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09QRSDSFX,B0BK9DC1H1,AHYMMEYK5YV34S3P56JIFJOJRXAQ,2023-03-02 18:56:34.711,0,True,499
616506,5,"Great audio, great battery life.","I've been using these for about a week now.  While I haven't used them constantly, I've had several multiple-hour music sessions, quite a few hours on YouTube, and a full-length movie.  Not only do I have yet to have to recharge them, it's still reporting that the battery level is ""high"" when I turn them on.  (Update: Battery lasted almost three weeks of very regular use!  Impressed!)<br /><br />They are light weight and have been very comfortable to wear for long stretches of time, I've forgotten I was even wearing them.<br /><br />I am comparing these to an older but far more expensive set of noise cancelling headphones which these are meant to replace.  These easily outperform the noise canceling, and the audio quality is certainly on par with those.  As with any noise canceling I've experienced, it works best in lower pitches.  It's not a complete silence of outside noise by any stretch, but it dampens it so that the audio more easily overpowers the background- and it does a good job.  My workbench is sharing my garage, so I'm around an AC unit and other annoying sounds and it's very nice to be able to block those out and enjoy my music with good audio at a volume that doesn't hurt my ears.<br /><br />The audio quality is very good, I am able to hear a full spectrum from lows to highs and everything between.  Quality audio while I'm listening to my music is something I really appreciate, and these perform at least in the same league with the best I've owned.<br /><br />There is an ""aux in"" to allow the headphones to operate in a wired mode.  It only works when the headphones are powered off, meaning that there is no noise canceling when running in the wired mode, and the audio response is noticeably not as good.  But it's nice to have, in case the battery dies or something while on a trip, or you want to use them with something but not pair the bluetooth.  They will also not operate while charging, which is a little of a bummer, but given the battery life that's really not a big problem at all.  The control buttons on the side are easy to locate by feel, and work as expected.<br /><br />I am very pleased with these!",[],B0BVYLNMCW,B0C42R1RBT,AE7ZMW4MM2RHVDMCSU6YF4MAMWKQ,2023-04-19 18:59:25.342,0,False,499
552629,4,Another head banger by Soundcore.,"A lot of reviewer's on U tube claimed these earbuds have too much bass to really enjoy, let's keep it real, all earbuds these days  have to be adjusted, this is not back in the day where everything was set straight out of the box, and it was all about the quality of your CD'S and CD player or cassette players, now days you have to be your own sound engineer, these earbuds are capable of any particular sound you want or need, Soundcore have a very unique companion app, once you become familiar with your custom EQ settings you can apply it to all your Soundcore earbuds, with noise cancellation on, it will give you a more bass driven sound, ambient mode will make it sound thinner, normal mode will make it sound flat. Keep in mind, your phone has a EQ running at the same time from the phone internal settings, they may conflict with each other, turn your phone EQ off then start your custom EQ settings on the earbuds app, then turn the phone EQ back on and adjust the earbuds again, then compare which sounds better to you, I have a 3rd party EQ app that will enhance every aspect of the sound of any headphones or earbuds, after the proper adjustments, these earbuds is almost perfect, also keep in mind you have to the right size ear tips to seal the best sound. All your music will not be digitally mastered on the same level from the recording studios, some may have a HD, hi res sound, and some may not, if certain songs seems like it's lacking something, it's not your earbuds, it's the sound quality of the song, to correct that problem, all you have to do is create several EQ settings with different highs and different lows and name them, you can create the best sound quality for any song. Soundcore is on top of their game, they create great sounding product's, but at the same time, they leave it up to you to create the best sound you like. Although these earbuds are considered sports earbuds, they're really high performance earbuds for any occasion. The reviews that said the bass is too much, that only tells me they don't have a clue on what they are doing. There's a android EQ app that can solve all their problems for free.

974427,5,Roomy backpack for laptop - full of pockets and storage spaces,"I'm a big backpack user (I don't wear ""purses"") so this appealed. This laptop backpack is super versatile. The manufacturer addressed many needs in its well-thought-out design. INSIDE: It's roomy, with a light gray polyester lining. The description says it can fit up to a 15"" laptop in one place and 17"" in another place in the padded section (NOTE: I fit my 15.6"" laptop which is 14"" L x 10"" W laptop in there and I'm pretty sure 17"" would also fit). The padded opening is approx. just under 12"" across. There are pockets and zippered sections on all 4 interior sides of the bag, including space dedicated for pens. Even with the laptop loaded in the bag, it offers plenty of room for additional materials such as papers, files, and books.<br /><br />OUTSIDE: The bag is made of water-resistant polyester. I ordered the grey for something different than my usual black color preference. It's handsome. The bag comes with two exterior nylon zippers in fashionable bright silver with silver pulls. The bag features two large slightly expandable side pockets for a water bottle or other objects. The back side has a black canvas band that can fit over the handle of other luggage for piggybacking a ride. Under the band is another wide hidden zipper. ADDITIONAL BAG: This product comes with a separate matching smaller bag with its own number of pockets for storage. It can be used separately as a purse (a strap is included) or can be cleverly snapped onto a canvas strip that runs across the front of the backpack bag, so it piggybacks on the larger bag. Great idea and looks nice. The opening at top of the laptop bag is large and wide and has two strong hidden wire supports. The stitching is clean and linear. The top of the bag features a handle in case the owner doesn't wish to wear it backpack-style.<br /><br />USB PORT: The laptop backpack has another useful feature, a built-in USB charger on the outside that connects to a built-in charging cable on the inside. as a way to charge one's phone while on the go. The bag owner needs to provide the power bank if using this feature; it's not included. It's a well-designed laptop backpack (and additional bag). I hope this information is helpful.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81wyLk4jbQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81wyLk4jbQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81wyLk4jbQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BRMQVXWM,B0BRM3DWZ6,AH23SSOK4NJAVA3JUYOI32RIURAQ,2023-04-07 05:12:04.371,0,False,499
963330,5,Scorp Mini,"I have a regular SCORP in addition to the Mini. The things I like most about them, compared to my DJI Ronins, are bang for the buck with respect to features, options, and form factor. The Ronins are nice, but they are straight. I like the SCORP handles because I can easily drop the camera down low and hold it comfortably. I film pets and use things like skateboards for movement, so holding the camera low to the ground is important.<br /><br />Is the SCORP series better than the Ronins? I wouldn't say that but I will say that they are more affordable and cover my needs.<br /><br />The Mini comes with hardware to attach a cell phone, GoPro, and smaller mirrorless cameras. It can also handle ""regular"" sized mirrorless cameras, but you are limited to smaller lenses. I have a Nikon Z6 II, and it was the first camera that I tried with the Mini. I got it to work with small telephoto lenses, but it seemed awkward. So, I check the camera and lens compatibility lists. Surprise, surprise. It turned out that the Z6 II is officially compatible with only one lens - and I don't own that lens.<br /><br />So, I switched to my small mirrorless camera, the Canon M6 Mark II. I didn't even check the compatibility list because it is considerably smaller than the Z6 II. It balanced much more easily, and it worked without any problems at all.<br /><br />The number of options and features exceed my needs. That's always a good thing. It works just fine, except for a soft shuddering that occurs when I first start it up. I don't know what triggers that shuddering or what it is doing, but because it doesn't hinder me at all, I figure it's not a defect but a feature.<br /><br />The Quick Start Guide is not worth much. The diagrams are too tiny and difficult to understand. Toss it and go straight to the manual. I didn't see a manual. Maybe I lost it. I simply downloaded the PDF manual, and I was good to go.<br /><br />If you think that your camera might be too big, check the compatibility list/chart. If you have a smaller mirrorless camera, cell phone, or GoPro, you should have no problems. Recommended.",[],B0B11ZGQ2J,B08YY91RM9,AHF7TPHK72VNTRAA675SXPJ2NVKQ,2023-02-06 01:29:18.209,0,False,499

This product is incredibly useful and packs a lot of great features in a small package that would come in very handy in an emergency, power outage/storm, or while camping or hiking.  I'd even go so far as to say I'd probably keep one of these in the trunk of my car as well as a 'just in case' item.  For starters, there is an AM/FM and Weather band radio with pull-out antenna that allows you to listen to important radio broadcasts or weather information in the event of an emergency or bad weather - the speaker quality is so-so, but it's good enough for hearing voice transmissions very well, which is all you really need for this type of device.  Then, there is the powerful LED torch on the front of the device paired with two powerful LED panels that can be switched on in any combination to create a flashlight or floodlight. Additionally, under the solar panel, there is an additional, extremely bright LED light panel that can be turned on separately from the rest to provide another floodlight source if necessary. There's also an SOS button on the back of the device which, when held down, will start a very loud, piercing siren along with a bright, flashing LED to attract attention.  As a plus, the device also has a port for you to plug in your cell phone or other USB-chargeable device and get power from the radio's built-in rechargeable battery.  Speaking of battery, you can not only charge the internal battery with the included USB power cable from an electrical source, but you can also flip open the solar charging panels to recharge the battery when strong overhead sunlight is available.  In an emergency, there is also a hand-crank that will recharge the battery as well.  It also has helpful LEDs on the side that let you know when charging is taking place as well as how much battery power is remaining.  On top of that, the manufacturer included a spot for 3-AAA batteries so that you can power the radio on battery power as well if desired.  All of this in a very lightweight and easy to use device that will easily fit in your backpack, trunk, or other camping gear bag.  I now consider this a must-have product in my household.",[],B0B936DXFT,B0BZCYYPKH,AEUMBLUZOHTTIAIMOIXVVHACXEUQ,2023-01-09 18:38:22.908,3,False,499
44601,5,The best monitor I’ve found for my home security system,"This monitor caught my attention as the listing states “Use for Home/Office/Security.” And I certainly needed some help viewing my home security cameras. I’ve tried 3 different brand 22” 1080p monitors with dismal results. As I’m using this Viewedge monitor for my 7 camera home security system, this review will discuss that use exclusively. If you’re interested in this monitor for computer use, other reviewers have presented very informative reviews.<br /><br />The camera system I have automatically shifts from daylight (color) to Infrared (monochrome) as the sun goes down. It was really the monochrome (aka black & white) video that presented the problems with the other monitors I tried. Color rendition during the day was ok but the b&w had too much contrast. Adjusting the contrast and brightness for the darkest areas washed out the other 90% of the picture. I added additional IR lighting outside which helped but didn’t solve the problem. But the Viewedge monitor solved the problem both simply and elegantly.<br /><br />The listing for this monitor states “wide viewing angle” which refers to the horizontal viewing angle. What it doesn’t state is that it has a large vertical viewing angle also. In all of the other monitors I tried, the image washed out terribly when viewed from above or below. In the Viewedge monitor all that happens is a slight loss of contrast most noticeable in the darkest parts of the image. And that is perfect at correcting the night time viewing problem I had.<br /><br />The monitor is wall mounted above and slightly to the right of my computer monitor so that motion on the monitor will catch my attention in my peripheral vision while I’m working on my pc. I had to adjust the brightness and contrast for the best picture, but the picture is now superb. I look up at the monitor at about a 20 degree angle and can easily see details in the previously dark edges of the camera video. Color rendition during the daytime is great. Viewing from below only decreases contrast slightly. And of course with the wide viewing angle I can see the cameras’ video from anywhere in the room when I’m standing although I do lose the optimized b&w view if I’m not at the computer.<br /><br />This monitor has made a huge difference in my security system.",[],B0B8BYXXSC,B0BVTLLP85,AH77INY6Y6VDO3VPK4AWJXC65ANA,2023-02-07 04:31:57.248,1,False,499
214626,5,Large backpack with a couple nice techy features,"Overall, this is a nice backpack.  It does not have the numerous pockets as others but those also cost twice as much.  For this price point, this is a good choice.  If you need multiple small pockets to organize items, look elsewhere.<br /><br />This backback does a good job at carrying various items of tech.  The padded laptop sleeve is in the back which rests against your back when carrying.  The padding will help keep it from feeling uncomfortable against your spine.  The straps are nice padded as well with mesh to help them breathe if they get a little damp from sweat on your back or hands.  The back is mesh for breathability as well.<br /><br />The inside pocket for a spare battery with an included USB-A cable is a neat feature.  Can charge devices without have to open the backpack up.<br /><br />There are credit card slots with foil mesh to protect the RFID chips from being read by walk-by scanners.  The slots are fairly loose so be careful as cards could get easily knocked out of them when accessing that larger pocket.  Be sure to put the RFID chips down into the pockets.  The RFID pockets are not large enough for something like a keyfob and since they dont close at the top, there's not full coverage which you need for a keyfob.<br /><br />The large, center pocket can easily carry a sweater, light jacket, couple towels, etc.<br /><br />I like that it has 2 water bottle mesh pockets, one on either side.<br /><br />The front pocket has a couple areas you could store your phone and then route headphone cord out the rubber cutout.  Not sure how many people still use corded headphones or earbuds but it's a nice feature if you do.  There's also a slot large enough to pass a USB-A cord if you needed that, too.  I see that as redundant given the built in USB cord for connecting internal and external devices.<br /><br />The back also has the strap to allow you to slide it over the extension handle of a roller type piece of luggage if you dont want to carry the backpack on your shoulders.<br /><br />Again, overall this is a good backpack at this price point.  Time will tell how durable it is so that's the only unknown at this point.",[],B0BNMDG6LG,B0C5J7N7WF,AF5EW2YULI3ZRHFTQBDZC3IIXI3A,2023-02-07 02:24:15.660,0,False,499
806529,5,It just works!,"As a tech enthusiast who is very particular about making sure that a switch does not reduce my signal strength, I am pleased to announce that this switch just works!<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Power supply via the included Micro USB cable is not ""necessary"".  I am attaching a pic from one of the pages of the user manual that clearly specifies this detail.  However, if any of your HDMI devices have insufficient power, only then is it required.  In my testing, power supply was not necessary when only connecting a PS5 but as soon as I connected a PS4 and PS5, the tiny circular LED indicator started blinking.  The user manual did not help in troubleshooting this blinking behavior.  However, when I connected the provided Micro USB power cable and supplied power to the switch, the blinking stopped and both PS4 and PS5 connected to the TV just fine.<br /> - It just works.  I have attached a screenshot from the PS5 ""Video Output Information"" screen that shows 4K60, HDR and also VRR. In other words, all the required specs were transmitted fine using this switch with no loss in quality that I could tell.<br /> - Also tested on the PS4 and when I access the ""Video Output Information"" screen on the PS4, it showed all the correct signal specs with no loss of transmission.  Since the PS4 is not 4K, I was receiving 1080p60 for the signal with HDR supported and Color Format as RGB.<br /> - The center big circular button allows for easy switching between the two HDMI inputs if you press it.  When turned on, this big button lights up green as well as the tiny circular LED.  The tiny circular LEDs are labeled 1 and 2 for the respective HDMI inputs.  See attached pic showing the lights (note: the pic shows HDMI Input 2 with green light because that input was active.)

184330,2,Not Sure About This Product,"This device sounded like the answer to my needs to move files from my iPad and Android phone to my PC. But I am not at all sure about its utility or safety.<br /><br />I first tried it on my Android phone, to transfer photos to my computer. The instruction sheet packaged with the product required me to get out my 8x loupe to read them. We’re talking seriously tiny and dense.<br /><br />The Android instructions only covered 3 panels. I followed them carefully, but the interface on my phone was not the same as they illustrated. I was told to find the pictures I wanted in ‘Files,’ select them, and ‘copy.’ Then go to the flash drive in ‘Files,’ and press ‘paste.’ Unfortunately, when I selected the photos, there was no ‘copy’ option that I could find, only ‘Copy To.’ When I tried ‘Copy To,’ this flash drive was not listed as one of the options. There may be a way to do this, but I couldn’t find it.<br /><br />I thought things might be better on the iPad. But the instructions for iOS run 18 PAGES of microscopic type! It looks very complicated.<br /><br />The very first step is to install an App on the iPad called ‘Y-Disk.’ So I went to the App Store and it was easy to find. But to be honest, the overwhelming number of One Star reviews claiming all kinds of things from from not working, to working very poorly, to data corruption and loss of photos, to being spyware, etc, etc, really took me aback. I sorted the reviews by date to see if perhaps the maker had fixed early problems, but this gave an even higher percentage of bad reviews! So many users REALLY hated the App and the Flash Drive it was made for that I had to take notice.<br /><br />At that point, I decided that I didn’t want to risk my devices, or my data and photos and videos, for the sake of writing this review. Maybe it’s an okay product, maybe it’s not. But because I need to give it a star rating, I’m giving it a 2, and will leave it to the reader to consider their own risk tolerance.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61wiBgHITqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61wiBgHITqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61wiBgHITqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BPS3WP11,B0BXD66VLG,AFMD5BRBVMZ6RZDDOKGL462KTUYA,2023-01-11 01:03:01.887,1,False,499
122531,3,"Blu-Ray Region Free capability broke in 2 years, DVD still works","Like others, I purchased this unit to allow me to play discs from around the world. The region free DVD capability works great, as it easily switches regions automatically. The Blu-Ray region free capability (at least that provided by the unit 220 Electronics shipped), leaves much to be desired. I must preface the following with the statement that I have NEVER switched Blu-Ray regions on this unit, ever, as I have yet to buy a non Region A disc.<br /><br />With all the streaming options out there, I have not watched a Blu-Ray disc in about 8 months. The other month (25 months after the unit was purchased) I attempted to watch a newly purchased Region A Blu-Ray disc. The player gave me an error that it could not play the disc because it was not the correct region. After restarting the player and going through the instructions on how to switch between regions, it just refused to play the disc. I then tried another disc, a Disney title that happens to be Region Free/Multi-Region A/B/C. That disc played fine, as did all the other Multi-Region A/B/C discs I had. But all Region A locked discs refuse to play.<br /><br />I contacted 220 Electronics and to their credit they promptly provided instructions on to re-set the unit. I did so, but it still refused to play the region locked discs. I do not have any Region B or C discs to check to see if the player somehow became locked on one of those and refuses to switch, but it really would not help me anyway. Despite their ""region free guarantee"" I was told since the player was out of warranty I would have to ship it in and pay for repair, but they could not provide an estimate for the repair cost.<br /><br />I would understand if the basic functions of the unit itself were not working (e.g. refusing to play anything, skipping, not powering up, etc.), but the only thing that does NOT work is the region free capability that 220 Electronics added to the player, which is supposed to be ""guaranteed"". Again, for clarity, the unit plays all DVD discs, from the various regions I have, and all multi-region Blu-Rays. The unit just refuses to switch the region for Blu-Rays to allow region locked discs to play, which makes it useless for Blu-Rays.",[],B075VCYRG4,B077N77QKW,AECGPRGIUBS6VAKTEGTRWCMKVONA,2023-04-16 18:53:38.621,6,True,499
73750,3,"A stand with integrated USB hub and cooling - good on paper, but the execution is lacking","[[VIDEOID:a834d77e35560b2e63ac892d16447bd3]] This review is for the Ergopollo Laptop Cooling Pad with Ultra Quiet Fans and a 4-Port USB hub. On paper, this is a great idea since laptop stands tend to be rather bulky, and the added fan and USB hub functionality is both useful and a clever utilization of space. Unfortunately, this product doesn't live up to its potential because this product's stand, fan, and hub components all have substantial limitations, so as a whole, the product is somewhat awkward.<br /><br />The stand is fixed height, which is disappointing from both ergonomic and portability perspectives. I prefer to align the top or bottom edges of my laptop's screen with my primary monitor so that on-screen elements are lined up when I move across workspaces. My other complaint is that while the stand is advertised as being suitable for laptops up to 17.3"", the top deck is much too small. 15.6"" to 16"" is the maximum recommended size since, for larger laptops, their feet might be spaced further than the deck's width, resulting in the deck pressing directly on the machine's bottom cover.<br /><br />Concerning the fans, while I appreciate that they can be turned on/off without impacting the USB hub's function, I'd prefer the LED lighting and fan speed to be separately controllable. As equipped, the Ergopollo's stand's fans spin at a single speed, and they're a bit buzzy. Also, while they start with the same light sequence, the fans lose color synchronization after a minute or so.<br /><br />Lastly, the USB3 Hub functionality is nice, but it's a missed opportunity for this product to be solely bus-powered. I prefer having the option to use a separate 5V adapter so that the stand could also work as a USB charger when the laptop isn't there. Making the product self-powered would also allow for using more high-powered devices, such as SSDs, without the risk of the hub shutting down due to excess power draw.<br /><br />Overall, I think this stand is ""okay."" It was easy enough to assemble, and it works, but it could have been so much more.<br /><br />Notes<br />1) Ergonomic Chicken, anyone?",[],B0BG2K61J1,B0BG2K61J1,AFW3CAOLOJI3GGBAIUKTVD73ITMA,2023-01-15 09:19:55.486,0,False,499

It has 4 USB-A 3.0 ports, a 4 band audio/microphone 3.5 mm jack, 2 HDMI jacks (1 is 2k and 1 is 4k), a gigabit Ethernet jack and is self powered allowing for more devices connected by USB on the computer that won't take power from the ports on the PC or Laptop being used. This also has a power button on it so you can turn it off to disable USB-A devices plugged into this docking station when not in use.<br />*Unit is fairly small at about 5 inches wide, 4 inches deep, and 2.5 inches tall (roughly) but is very convenient to have and it makes it pretty portable too if needed.<br /><br />Cons, Dislikes<br />*The 2 HDMI ports are different in resolution, 1 is 2k and 1 is 4k, but I don't know why they both couldn't be 4k. Can 2 monitors not work with 4k resolution through USB-C or USB-A 3.0 or greater data connection?<br />*This must be powered, it cannot function on its own as a docking station without being powered by its AC power adapter.<br /><br />I think this is strait forward for a docking station. I put what I liked and what features this has but also shared my thoughts about them too like the HDMI. This works really well and I have 2 24 inch monitors using it now I just don't understand why 2 4k channels couldn't pass through a USB-C connection but I don't understand the data transfer involved either so I am curious too. The rest is strait forward and adding 3 USB's to a computer along with 2 monitors just taking up 1 USB on the computer - what could you want better than that? A Good Looking Docking Station, and that is this, no plugs or wires on the front so it keeps the desk nice and clean. Works great, highly recommend this for anyone needing multiple monitors, extra USB-A 3.0 ports, a closer headset jack, etc.<br /><br />This requires a USB-A 3.0 or better USB-A port or a USB-C port on the computer to function properly.",[],B0BG9SYQT3,B0BG9SYQT3,AGHE2EDF3FFNNWAVGAQ4S6K7PBKQ,2023-01-19 05:05:45.198,0,False,499
648731,5,Good for movies and games,"I got this projector on sale for $80 to replace the crappy TV I had in my room. On my PS4 in the video settings I noticed the projecter was 24hz (which means the max youre able to visually see is 24FPS or 24 frames per second which is how many ""pictures"" on screen show up in one second) which is normal for console gaming, but after some googling I read that 24hz is best enjoyed with movies and is too low for games. I use this mostly with the console portion of my game room and so far my PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, have ran and looked perfectly fine. If anyone is picking this projecter up for cheap to play some games on a bigger display this projector would do perfectly. Of course with any projector youll want to invest in some speakers that either plug into the projector itself or your console. If you're looking for a projector that does 4k be prepared to do some more searching and have at least $50 extra that you're willing to spend. There arent many great projectors like this one out there, especially for $130. so your best bet is this projector, if you dont care if its 1080p or 4k. Now unfortunately mine would have been 5 stars, but the box came with a hole in the side and theres a small, but noticeable, black spot on the screen. I'm pretty sure the screen is just dirty but theres no way to clean it unless you want to try your luck removing the entire bottom part and cleaning the projector and remembering where everything goes when putting it back together.  Mine was definately used, but im not sure how long. Hopefully their support responds and maybe I can get sent a new unit, or some instructions on how to easily clean the inside.<br /><br />EDIT: okay nvm I was looking at the wrong tab on my PS4, video playback is 24hz, regular video settings (under Sound & Screen) show 60hz<br /><br />EDIT 2: After talking with their support for a little bit they offered to send over a completely new projector free of charge!

874786,1,Headset with great potential but a few flaws,"This headset has a lot of great things going for it. The sound quality for a low-cost headset is reasonably good, both for calls and for listening to music. The microphone quality is not as good, but it is usable. I bought an inexpensive Sennheiser headset and its microphone quality is 10x better. But then again the Sennheiser costs more too (but not as much more as you'd expect). The combination of cables and options to use it either as a 3.5mm headset and a USB-A headset are great. Those are all of the good qualities of it. I think the biggest problem for most people will be the headphone size. At its largest adjustment, it is not large enough for the average adult head. I've got a small head and most headphones are too big for me. But these headphones were so tight, I'm inclined to say these were designed for kids. You should take this into consideration if you are thinking about these. The small size will make these uncomfortable to wear for more than a few minutes. The second issue is the angling of the on-ear pieces. Most on-ear have a hinge that allows the ear covers to sit comfortably on your ears. These do not have the proper hinge angle and are very uncomfortable and smash against your ears. Once again, a minor tweak could make these great, but in their current form, they hurt after more than a few minutes. The next flaw has to do with quality control of the USB-A to 3.5mm adapter. The build quality is poor and causes either heavy static or the microphone to function improperly due to lack of contact of the 3.5mm barrel and female receptacle. I had reached out to the seller and they sent a replacement. This one was better, but wasn't great and still has some issues. Its also difficult to tell if the ""MUTE"" function is activated or not. For the money, if they could fix the size/fit issue, I'd probably give it a few more stars. My go-to headset of choice for WebEx/Zoom/Skype meetings are the Microsoft ones. They don't sound as good as these and cost 500% more, but they are a headset that I can wear for hours comfortable and they fit an adult head. If Olyre did a little bit of work and made a few tweaks to the design, they could have a really great headset.",[],B09V2B3WTH,B09V2B3WTH,AE5GUXXUJDTSIGUMDVYL4GYXYMCA,2023-01-31 06:07:28.637,0,True,499
208003,5,Performant Mesh system,"With the increase of connected devices in our home, the need for a faster and more reliable network is essential. 4 years ago I upgraded my internet service and router to the top of the line service and equipment. However with the addition of few IoT devices coupled with nonstop HD streaming my home network started to struggle, so I added a second WiFi6 router as its own subnet solely dedicated to WiFi traffic, that worked well for few months then I needed a WiFi6 extender to cover a dead  zone, I chose a D-link E15 which turned out a good choice for my latest upgrade to this D-link Mesh bundle as it too is managed through the same Eagle Pro app.<br />The issue with my previous setup is I had to configure every WiFi access point with a unique SSID which made some devices to not know how or when to switch to the most reliable WiFi when another is down or slow. Of course I could've names all SSIDs the same which I did, but that caused a nightmare to troubleshoot when one is down or suboptimal and you can't tell which one is which without more digging.<br />This Mesh network solves all that as it basically sets itself as one WiFi across every Mesh device and all connected devices will seamlessly transition from one to another without you even noticing.<br />The setup was a breeze, all I had to do is unplug my existing WiFi gateway and plug in one of the two D-link routers. The app which I happen to already have installed detected the new device after scanning its QRcode and set it up in no time. All I had to do next is plug-in the 2nd router in the area where I wanted extended coverage, the router basically knew it's a part of a Mesh ans sets up itself!<br />My old D-link extender of course went offline as it no longer could find its old SSID to extend. But just resetting it to default was enough for it recognize the new mesh network and add itself to it, I was amazed I didn't have to do anything! After all I think this is how things should work.<br />One tiny complaint is the unconventional DC jack the routers use for power. To be able to use this as a direct drop-in to replace my old router, I had to reuse the same 12V adapter but with a DC jack converter to adapt to the new and smaller size.<br />5 stars",[],B0B9RJNWPY,B0BXX8BSYM,AHS4G7UZXQ6334X6JV46MAA52WSQ,2023-03-26 03:35:07.577,0,False,499
673478,5,"Bright, good quality of light and slim","The brightness on this light is great, I did a bit of a burn in on this to see battery length and with my not totally full 65.1wh 7.4v battery, it lasted 6 hours at 100% at the mid level kelvin setting.<br /><br />I'm a little disappointed that this light didn't come with an AC power cable since it has the option to run off of a 6.8-12v center positive barrel style power source.  However, everyone uses Sony batteries and they're very cheap. My favorite Sony style batteries for these lights are the ones with the LCD panel that shows the power level: https://amzn.to/3KzK9FY<br /><br />One aspect about this light that I haven't seen on any other smaller lights like this is it has a battery ""test"" button with four LED lights that show you the level of your battery on case you don't have a battery with a readout which is typically all of them. So that was handy!<br /><br />I really enjoy the tactile potentiometers, the dials! 😃 the knobs turn with hard stops, pretty nice to know you're at 100% or at one side of the dial or the other without looking at a readout. That being said, the knobs could use some markings on them (a simple dot), if you for some reason need know the actual percentage of light volume or need more accurate knowledge of kelvin settings you're on, or I suppose if you were being directed to move from one number to another, simply adding a little dot with some nail polish or paint marker will come in very handy, specially if you need to tell someone at a glance what your light is set to.<br /><br />So far I'm really liking this light, for run and gun shooters using this on top of a camera, know that there is not much battery ""locking"" on the battery mounting area. Meaning no actual button to release the battery, it's friction based, I couldn't see that being a horrible issue, but if it's bumped it WILL fall off.<br /><br />The mounting base is a 1/4"" inch female and cold shoe combo. The pivoting part of this is quite interesting to note that it is actually a ""gopro"" style neck and can fit other go pro mounts which is pretty unique.",[],B0BQQYG69W,B0BQQYG69W,AHRDEOQS27BU5EFBEZ4TPLOOTWMQ,2023-04-06 06:56:27.768,0,False,499
679562,4,Mixed bag for me,"For the record, I am a very seasoned software engineer who also knows my way around hardware.  Anyway, this drive is a mixed bag for me.  On the one hand, now that I ""cleared everything up"" the drive seems pretty solid.  I didn't do any speed tests since many others will provide that information and honestly, I'm really not all that concerned about whether or not this SSD has 'amazing' speeds, especially since much of that depends upon what computer you install it in and what that motherboard supports.<br /><br />In case it helps, I installed this on a Lenovo P1, replacing a 256GB secondary drive I already had installed in the P1.<br /><br />Anyway, let's start with the positives.  The disk seems to be plenty fast, and Windows sees it as having a capacity of 953GB which I think is pretty normal.  After copying my backed-up files from my previous SSD backup drive, Visual Studio opened up the project I am currently working on and didn't miss a beat, so everything I copied over to this new SSD obviously worked as expected.<br /><br />Now for the not so great.  When I installed the backup SSD that this SSD replaced, it was simply a matter of plugging it in and turning on the P1, at which point, Windows saw the new drive, assigned a new drive letter and boom, I was done.  With this SSD, not so much.<br /><br />After installing this SSD and turning the P1 back on, Windows showed me two new drives, both of which did not actually exist and were not useable.  I had to go into 'disk management' and set the SSD up properly.  After that, I still had the two 'phantom' drives listed in Windows Explorer, so I had to go back into disk management and remove both of them.  Not the end of the world but I shouldn't have to do that and neither should you.<br /><br />If you are not a very technical person and you run into the same issue, I could see it being very frustrating.  In all honesty, it probably took me less than 10 minutes to resolve everything, but I do have a decent idea about what I am doing.

199913,5,Awesome Value,"I have used quite a few Bluetooth sound devices and these Tagry X18s stand out a having an outstanding feature set for a very affordable price.  The attributes include:<br /><br />The come with a well designed case with the USB charging port in front allowing you to charge your phone or other device.  The case has a solid feel to it and has a easily readable display showing the overall charge percent and a charging scale for each bud.<br /><br />The buds themselves are well-designed.  My left ear canal must be inordinately large because I have tried many other buds with the largest rubber pad and none have ever consistently stayed in my ear.  However, the X18s do.  I think design of the rubber flange helps hold it in place, but I also think they seem to be lighter and therefore less apt to fall out.  It's a huge benefit knowing they are going to stay in place.<br /><br />In addition to their design, the buds function with ease.  One feature I frequently use is the one-touch, start/stop.  I frequently use the buds in the gym and walking my dog and having the ability to stop the sound when you need to talk with someone is super nice.  I used to have to fumble with my phone to pause what was playing but now it's a quick finger tap to the right bud.  You do have to pay attention though as I have put the buds in a pocket and later realized they started my audiobook by accident.<br /><br />The sound quality is also very good.  I have a couple of different Beats products and the sound is at least as good if not better.  Music playback is very clear with a full range of sound.  You get the sense the 'stereo' effect is improved with buds.  They produce a surround sound or 'immersive sound' as they describe it.  This really distinguishes the X18s compared with other products.  They also have worked well with phone calls.  The voices were very clear for both parties.<br /><br />I haven't tested the battery life in terms of total hours but have noticed the battery charge goes down very slowly which means they will likely last a long time between charges.<br /><br />Overall, the X18s are a great product at any price but are a super great value for about $30.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617R2IyEpRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617R2IyEpRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617R2IyEpRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61roHG+RXiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61roHG+RXiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61roHG+RXiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xQm0OkPeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xQm0OkPeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xQm0OkPeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BHN4X77K,B0BZ3WYJL1,AHNHD6VJ6OBXXU7ZOVI55XIUESYA,2023-01-02 16:26:27.371,21,True,499

I'm a big guy and traditionally headphones have felt like clamps on my ears. These ones well... they're not bad at all. They don't get sweaty. The band is comfortable. The clamp is there but it's really pretty light... I'd say probably 50-75% less tiring to wear than the old pair, which is pretty impressive.

Yes, lip sync on videos will be massively off when you're in wireless mode. That's a bluetooth thing.<br /><br />- The charging. They don't last that long. Feels like two days working to me, maybe 20-30 hours. Worse... they don't function while plugged into charge. Bummer as I have a wall long cord charger that would be fun to use... but they just don't work when charging.<br /><br />- The included short cable. They include two audio cables... the included long one is not the one I need of course. The short one they include I need for wired mode... and this thing will come out about 3 feet from behind the point it comes under my monitor. That's VERY awkward my setup because this little cord has to plug in the middle of my monitor so literally has to rest straight down the middle of my keyboard. There's no extra slack on it. The lack of flexibility and choices with wired mode plugged is just sad there. I will have to buy an extra cable for these now.<br /><br />However, I still give them 4 stars for a few reasons... very comfortable.

(USB, AVI, Optical cables and Power Supply)<br />Many people will opt for the Optical cable hookup, as this was top of the line until more recently.<br /><br />Tested on a portion of a program, GREAT SOUND! Nice to have equalizer settings on the remote, along with Music, TV, and Movie pre-sets, and full volume control on my ROKU remote.<br /><br />Hooking up via BT with my living room Alexa was a snap, and it really enhanced the sound!.<br /><br />Sorry this gets a bit long, but, to paraphrase Instagram reels, ""read to the end!""<br /><br />Since my TV has ARC-HDMI, I decided to try that. I also happened to remember that I had a 3 foot ""Hi-Speed HDMI"" cable from many years ago. Went and dug it out of my junk tub in the garage. Setup could not have been easier! Plugged in the power, plugged into the HDMI ARC socket on the TV, then into the soundbar. Powered everything up, switched the TV sound output to HDMI, everything worked perfectly!<br /><br />Turned everything off, went on to other things for the day. Sat down after dinner, turned on Chernobyl, SOUND WAS TERRIBLE!! Kept shifting in and out, softer and louder, full of static. Went back ad wiggled the HDMI connections, and it got better for a short time, then went wonky again. DAMN! I figured this is why it was at auction!<br /><br />Then I thought about that OLD HDMI cable, questionable speed, quality, and most likely oxidized connections.  Ordered a new, HDMI ARC cable off Amazon for less than $10. It arrived this morning, I hooked it up, and everything works perfect!

306805,5,Absolutely 100% Amazing!!!!!!,"This projector is !@#$% Awesome!!! It's supper small and compact, but packs some power! I love it! This was extremely easy to setup...without the remote I might add... It linked up to all our home networks and iphones. The projector has a sound speaker built-in, which is okay. But...you can also plug it directly into a sound source or Bluetooth it to another source. We have played videos from our phones, laptops, and the Nintendo switch to play games on the big screen. Speaking of big screen...I didn't know that this comes with it's own screen you can use!! We have an 6' x 12' inflatable one for parties, but this one is perfect for smaller events and is far easier to setup. The projector also comes with it's own lens cover and cleaning kit. It also has a remote (if you want to use it...not really needed). The image is super sharp and detailed, focusing is super simple and effective. Here are the pro's and con's of what I've found using it...<br /><br />Pro's<br />- Small and portable<br />- Extremely crisp and sharp image<br />- Supper easy setup<br />- Connects very easily to networks, laptops, iPhones and gaming systems<br />- Comes with additional connection cables for older systems (HDMI, Sound cords, etc..)<br />- Does NOT overheat or get supper hot when running<br />- Quick startup!! AND shut down!<br />- Built-in tilt and angle adjustments<br />- Can still be viewed in low lighting conditions<br />- Built-in sound speaker, Or...can be connected to separate sound source<br />- Bluetooth compatible<br />- Puts a smile on your face!!!<br /><br />Con's<br />- hmmmm???<br />- The only con is....that there IS no con's...sorry...<br />- Muscle cramps from smiling too much... I guess?? haha<br /><br />Overall, this little gem works great! The kids and family love it!!! We use this almost every day! I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a small, simple, compact projector that's easy to use and highly effective!! I promise you won't be disappointed!!

29033,5,Updated: Great Cable - Revised Plugs,"This is an up-date to my prior review. I have changed my rating from a 1 star to a 5 star, for the reasons listed below. I received a reply from the manufacturer after posting my original review. In their reply, the manufacturer advised:<br /><br />“… I am writing to let you know that we have completed an upgrade to our product that effectively solves the problems you were experiencing before. We are willing to send you a completely upgraded cable.<br /><br />Previously our cables had two problems.<br /><br />The first was that it did not fit with the thicker phone cases. This is because our cable uses a zinc alloy case to enhance the quality, but the zinc alloy case is larger and when using some of the phone cases with smaller charging holes, it will cause the problem of not charging or charging intermittently.<br /><br />The second problem, is that when using USB A to C to charge iPad, it may not charge. This is caused by using a low power charger and the low speed charging protocol is not compatible with the iPad.<br /><br />We take customer feedback very seriously and continue to improve the product and have completely solved these problems. We have made the following upgrades.<br /><br />1. Extend the Lightning connector by 0.2mm<br />2. Upgraded the charging chip, compatible with more charging protocols. No matter what combination can be charged.”<br /><br />The manufacturer subsequently sent me a replacement cable with the newly designed connectors for both the iPhone (lighting) and iPad (usb-c) which now are able to properly connect to the charging port on both devices, while inside a protective case, and maintain a power connection, as intended. I will now order additional cable as the cables are very sturdy and well made.<br /><br />Initial Review: The walls (see the blue arrows in the accompanying photo) surrounding the plugs are too thick to properly plug into an iPhone or iPad (lighting or USB-C) if the device is in a case unless the cut-out in the case is un-usually large (or modified) enough to accommodate the large housing around the plug. This was confirmed on various brands of cases. As a result, the cable will not plug far enough into the charging port to charge the device. The design is very unfortunate because the cable itself is strong and heavy duty.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mTbAddSoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mTbAddSoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mTbAddSoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B9J8WZ65,B0B9J8WZ65,AFS3PEIA6CD5YEO4UB46PA5QGQ4A,2023-03-22 18:35:28.451,13,True,499
924003,4,Assembly experience,"Just so much harder than it had to be because of short shrift instructions and just over a minute video that adds nothing.  Instructions for removing the side and front doors were okay.  After that, you can pretty much throw them away, except they do provide a framework for the order of assembly.  The first problem I ran into was where the rails fit.  After wasting 45 minutes to try to figure that out, I decided skip that step, with the thought in the back of my mind that not mounting the rails would result in me having to disassemble.  I didn't use any of the mounting hardware except for the washers.  I had four 2 1/2 inch stainless steel that I used.  I used a drill bit to drive a pilot, which really helps to sink the screws.  I mounted the side door frames which lines with the back plate.  Next slide the bottom of the tray - bit tricky but make sure the plate rests on the lip of the back plate - there are no screws that hold it in, but it was surprising sturdy.  Next is the top plate which snaps in similarly to the bottom plate.  Next is the front frame and it has places for four screws.  I revisited the rails and to my surprise they could be screwed in to place with no difficulty. At that point, I left off all the doors and essentially began transitioning my network.  I bought two shelves that I wouldn't recommend as they had some alignment issues, but I managed to get them to work.  I added the Pyle power strip, and it's not really that functional - access to outlets is very difficult and most adapters will use the space of at least two of the outlets.  But it looks good.  I re-routed all the wires and moved my router and modem - see picture.  Then I added the doors and the ground cable.  I'm sure I'll modify the wiring later as I look to add another network device and maybe a couple of hubs. But before I do that I want to add a couple of fans.  I was expecting the unit to have fans and it's not marked that they are not included.  Moreover, would have been nice if the seller had recommended a fan that is available online.  I think the unit should have included a couple of shelves as I think it's going to take some experimentation to find the best way to use the space.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dyRQ3ELGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dyRQ3ELGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dyRQ3ELGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kKXleIjEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kKXleIjEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kKXleIjEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09FJK1PD7,B09FJLG7G9,AFWZ7RGGAQI7O43UB7HQCEKA5GDQ,2023-02-21 18:16:03.368,0,True,499
89371,1,The custom service is absolutely awful !!!,"I was using this docking station for about 1 year. It was working fine until one day it suddenly stopped working. All ports are down, I'm an engineer, I did all kinds of A/B testing and trial. I know it's broken for sure. And It's still within the warranty so I reached out to the seller and the customer service was absolutely awful.<br />------<br />I clearly described the issue, attached the photo, and followed whatever instruction they asked me to try. <br />After lots of back and forth, I started to realize they never really try to resolve the problem but just try to hold you off.<br />------<br />They started with blaming the software update, then asked you to try a bunch of nonsense. They even lied about their product and see attached pictures for evidence,<br />------<br />I've told them all the ports of the station are not working, and I sent them a picture that shows the usb port is not providing power. They told me this, ""Do you want the hub to be powered on when it is not plugged into the computer, and then the USB port will supply power to other devices? If this is the case, it is absolutely impossible to achieve. The hub needs to be plugged into the computer to start the hub.""<br />------<br />1. I know this is wrong, the usb will supply power regardless if the computer is plugged or not based on my previous experience.<br />2. I've sent them a picture that shows usb has no power while the computer is plugged, so they didn't even look at the picture.<br />------<br />So, I re-bought a new one just to pop their lie. And check the photo I attached, see how they claim that the usb won't supply power when the computer is not plugged in. And the second picture shows the new one I got works exactly unlike how they said!<br />------<br />Spent days with the custom service, and based on the conversation, I can assure you when a problem happens, they are just trying to find excuses and hold you off until you give up.<br />I don't remember when was the last time I'm writing a complaint, but this seller is so far the worst I spoke with on Amazon.

558028,4,Nifty VPN gateway for your home network,"This is a good little router with VPN that is easy to set up. I've run into a few challenges (more below), but overall it works well.<br /><br />First thing to know: at its core, it runs the powerful and flexible OpenWrt router software, and that alone makes it a capable router. I won't talk about OpenWrt here: you can learn plenty about it elsewhere.<br /><br />On top of OpenWrt, GL.Inet has layered:<br /><br />- A Web interface that is simpler to use than OpenWrt's standard Web interface for configuring your network. (You can still get to OpenWrt's interface if you need it.)<br />- Support for a couple of popular VPN technologies (OpenVPN and WireGuard), allowing the router to supply VPN services for your entire network. This is the product's biggest value-add... more on that below.<br />- The availability of a few additional applications, including Dynamic DNS and AdGuard Home.<br /><br />The VPN capabilities are the core of this router's appeal: it's a path to VPN for your entire home/business network. It can proxy all of your traffic through the VPN, or be configured for selective proxying: limited to certain destinations, or to certain of your hosts, or to a VLAN. So, for example, if you want your desktop PC to use a VPN to the central office, while leaving the rest of your network off the VPN, it's easily done.<br /><br />The VPN also has knowledge of certain VPN providers (such as NordVPN), and makes it especially easy for you to set up and use VPNs through those providers.<br /><br />There is one area I've run into trouble: the behavior of DNS while I'm doing selective proxying - that is, while proxying some (but not all) of my systems. Some lookups of web addresses and even local addresses return bad results. After discussion on the support forum, I got a workaround that appears to work well: configuring the router to use secure DNS. This shouldn't be necessary, but it does get me past the issue, and I'm able to keep selective proxying turned on.<br /><br />I hope to see future firmware updates that address the outstanding DNS issues, but even now I'm using the router and VPN successfully.",[],B0BQMJ2GZC,B0BQMJ2GZC,AHWA72P4A2JYX52L23DBYUYLCPPQ,2023-02-04 22:33:28.177,3,False,499
943926,4,Good but not Great,"I've wanted bone conduction headphones for a long time and finally decided to take the plunge and ordered several different brands to compare and use.  One thing that is common to all bone conduction headphones is that instead of hearing sound through tiny speakers inserted into, or over, your ears the sound is transmitted through vibration.  Because of this sound bleed to people near you is at a minimum.<br /><br />These headphones do a pretty decent job.  They pair easily with your phone or computer via Bluetooth and the headphones reproduce mid to high frequency sounds pretty well while the lower frequency bass loses its fulness. Because of this, which has so far been pretty standard across all the ones I have tested, I use them mainly for listening to audiobooks or other mostly spoken content.<br /><br />Because these headphones are open ear ambient sound from your environment can be distracting or even drown out what you are listening to - largely because it is hard to get enough volume to isolate yourself.<br /><br />Wearing these headphones is very comfortable, especially for long periods of time where in-ear earbuds can begin to hurt your ears.  They're also waterproof with an IPX8 rating.<br /><br />These headphones also allow you to download your own music into internal memory  which provides 32 Gb of space.  That is great when you do not have your phone with you or where/when you are having BT issues.  Strangely, the volume and density of sound of internal music surpasses that which you get through BT streaming.  I'm not sure why this is but it is something to keep in mind.<br /><br />Charging (and loading your own music) is accomplished via a proprietary cord which is provided - although I am assuming this is to keep water from any internal components I always worry that the cord will break or get lost thereby requiring a purchase of a new cord or junking the headphones.  Given that the sellers are often foreign companies of ""questionable"" sustainability or longevity on Amazon this should be taken into account when purchasing. The control buttons on the right earpiece sit behind your ear and the buttons are difficult to press - something I am again assuming has something to do with the waterproof rating.  These problems are real but of limited weight when trying to decide whether to purchase these headphones.<br /><br />All in all these are a good buy at the current price.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HC-iEwSeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HC-iEwSeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HC-iEwSeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+097LIGcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+097LIGcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+097LIGcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MkoWSXFML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MkoWSXFML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MkoWSXFML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uAXgyA0EL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uAXgyA0EL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uAXgyA0EL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ueS6eywLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ueS6eywLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ueS6eywLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BML789NN,B0BML9FY6J,AGZECRBJKJGTE2YGHLLR7WWREDUQ,2023-01-12 22:36:11.341,2,False,499

176787,3,Will work in a pinch; but misses on most of the details,"I have a few a couple other screens (one much larger w/ a mobile attachment base; one similar size meant for the wall) but I thought this one would be the right size AND be easy to take on the go.  It is more mobile and more sturdy than the ones I currently have BUT, I thought it would be a simple take down and transport and it's not.  You have to completely take down and reassemble every time you want to pack it up and take it somewhere.  Though the screen comes w/o wrinkles, this packing and unpacking will inevitably lead to wrinkling (and extra time wasted).  Due to the screen type, you can see the pole behind it when there is a light source behind the screen.  The cloth screen, however, is no worse or better than most other cloth screens out there..  Only a stiffer, more vinyl/paper like screen would completely hide the stand.  The picture quality is 99.9% going to be a result of the projector you're using.  (My photos are using a cheap projector made for night/total dark environments; taken during the day time with blinds mostly closed.)<br /><br />I'm proficient at assembling things so I had no issues figuring things out BUT the instructions are pretty terrible and require a little intuition, which is a problem for those who don't like to or aren't as experienced in assembly.  There are a lot of thumb screws instead of quick latching mechanisms.  These thumbscrews and the latches on the upper/lower poles stick out and you have to maneuver the screen around them.  You have to manually align the screen which usually isn't completed on the first try.  Also not easily done in one try?  Getting it tight enough to make a ""flat"" screen w/o wrinkles.  I was able to get it real tight by pulling the corners tight, but the middle run of the sides sucked in and didn't make a good  even sided rectangle.  When I loosened the corners, I attained a better rectangular shape but there were wrinkles/slack in the middle of the screen which could create unwanted shadowing of the picture.  I don't think this is made for outside unless it's covered/shielded from the wind.  All-in-all, it's alright and can cover you in some situations---just know what you're getting into.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711qQO3iHNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711qQO3iHNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711qQO3iHNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oAd5UuXyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oAd5UuXyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oAd5UuXyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BDM5W1PT,B0BDM5W1PT,AE5SQ5STT4PLUF3EMGCFGFXMEENA,2023-02-25 17:46:35.534,0,False,499
321291,3,Some pros but some unfortunate cons,"Unlike many of the earbuds I’ve reviewed I was familiar with the Back Bay brand though I have never used any of their products. Starting with the pros, the case and the buds have a quality look and feel. The case is made of strong plastic with subtle magnetic closure. The earbuds are also sturdy and well-made. The individual buds are rated for 8 hours and with the case the rating is 80 hours of play time. I tested the buds for a 7-hour session and they still had power, so 8 hours should be a reasonable estimate. I charged the case to full power when I received them and did not need to recharge them after 10 days of consistent 4 hour daily use. Some other pro features are an IPX7 waterproof rating, Qi wireless charging, and the call quality was good.<br /><br />Despite the pros, there were some bothersome cons for me. Regardless of the tips I tried that came with the buds I could only get an acceptable fit that became uncomfortable after about an hour of wear. Part of this was the ear hook is not very flexible and this style of earbud does not seem to fit my ears very well in general. I have tried a few other buds using a similar design and had similar problems with the fit so I’m attributing this con to be particular to my ears. Sound quality was okay, but I did not get the bass response that I was expecting even with the bass boost setting turned on. The sound quality may also be related to the fact that I could not get a good fit. The touch control response was inconsistent, working sometimes and not others or causing the wrong function. Though well-made the case is very large and cumbersome, not a good fit for a pocket. One annoyance that I had every time I opened the case is that the right earbud is on the left side of the case and the left earbud on the right side. Over time I’m sure I could get used to it but not in the time frame that I was testing them.<br /><br />To sum it up, the case and earbuds feel and look quality, and I wanted to like them, but the cons outweighed the pros for me. Acknowledging that the sound quality may be caused by my ear structure, and they may produce better sound with a proper fit I’m leaving a 3-star rating.",[],B0BDQNBMZX,B0BRL5KJ96,AF54WHRNK5TS2Y66MFMEXRDXXXUA,2023-01-19 06:17:32.376,0,False,499
539102,5,"Second Monitor, Easy to Integrate","[[VIDEOID:342a7e169c47a845b78c38d00b692719]] The InnoView monitor arrived in a timely fashion, packaged to protect it.  (Box inside a box.)  The instructions were simple, addressed several setup options, and provided QR Codes for additional online information.<br /><br />Connection consisted of attaching a power cable and plugging in the standard-to-mini HDMI cable between my laptop and the extra screen.  It powered up and initially mirrored the same background screen as the laptop.<br /><br />By using the Windows Settings for Display, it took only moments to designate the monitor as #2, and then select the Extend function, so my usable screen space was doubled.  With a friend's guidance, I learned to ""click and hold"" the #2 screen icon in Settings to position it in the same relative location as the physical location on my computer desk.  (The cord is not quite long enough to situate the InnoView monitor 'comfortably' on the right side of my laptop, due to where the ""out ports"" are on the left side.)<br /><br />Once the setup was accomplished, my screen real estate was effectively doubled.  When opening multiple applications, I can now ""drag"" them from one screen to the other, and size them to fit or scale them down.  This is incredibly helpful for having Second Life open to a dance club venue, and using the Mixxx music / voice mixer application to run my virtual DJ sets, keeping an eye on both.  It helps during my Virtual TableTop Role-Playing Games (VTTRPG), so I can view the ""world"" map and still have access to all my character stats on the other screen.<br /><br />The best part is the clarity, the resolution, and the size -- which is only nominally smaller than my laptop screen.

14940,5,"Excellent Case, Independent Non-Solicited Review","First and foremost I read the reviews on the TXesign Charge 5 case,  all of which at the time were Vine customer reviews involving a free product and imho,  the  reviews are indeed genuine,  honest and accurate appraisals of this excellent case. I purchased two JBL Charge 5's because they sound great and then purchased two of the TXesign cases designed for the JBL Charge 5. No free products, and no connection with TXesign or anyone else on this, so this is my honest opinion. This case really accents the look and design of the Charge 5. Dimension-wise it should fit a Charge 4 as well, but may somewhat block the battery indicator lights if that matters to anyone. Material has the look and feel of a high quality leather.The fit is excellent and this case really elevates the speaker's appearance  to look more attractive and expensive. All buttons and ports are easily accessible. This attractive, quality build case  certainly offers some protection and is great for transporting the speaker with the convenient shoulder strap. Some reviewers felt the two Velcro straps were a bit difficult yo work with and this is likely true for some users, but I found no concerning issue with them at all, and the case is so nice, the straps are definitely not a deal breaker. In fact , once you strap the unit in, how often would there be a need to strap and unstrap since the case does not alter the sound and actually looks great ? Plus once broken-in the straps should become easier to manipulate.  It's a valid point though by some of the reviewers who commented on the straps; however, the many pluses of this case far outweigh the rare times you may have to use the straps and many folks may not experience any concern with them at all.  IMO, TXesign earns an A+ on this product for design, quality, function, appearance and value.  Exceptional value for the price! TXEsign, please keep up the great work on your cases! The JBL Clip 3 silicone case by TXesign is also excellent.  My compliments to all the Vine reviewers who gave very accurate appraisals so they certainly deserve any perks afforded to them by Vine. I typically don't ever pay attention to reviews with free products or perks but the reviews here have changed that view somewhat, and are indeed genuine appraisals of this product, and that's very good to see.",[],B0BGLNLQ2X,B0BGLNLQ2X,AHZDZZ7KX3RNKBGH3GIXPDZBQ6XA,2023-01-11 02:47:19.649,0,True,499
305650,5,Sound is amazing but.( zero incentive) honest review is the best karma,"Sound: hands-down the sound is just like the expensive brands, I know this because I have four kids so they get the expensive earbuds and I get the cheap ones! Lol<br /><br />Batter life: really good! No complaints here,  I listen to my earbuds during work for like five hours, and I still have a decent amount of battery life without charging.<br /><br />Controls:  average. sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t register a tap, but I have found that to be true with almost all earbuds..<br /><br />Comfort: for me, they hurt my ears, but to be fair I am  4” 11  and have a little body frame , so my ears would be more comparable to a child’s ears, so I don’t think a lot of people would have the same problem as me.<br /><br />Overall : the only complaint I had was that they were uncomfortable in my ears, but I don’t think that would be a problem for everyone, but you cannot beat the sound that comes out of these. They are comparable to the most expensive brands and the battery life is good the controls are so so, but I really haven’t found a pair of earbuds are the controls are perfect.. as with all earbuds. The pause button always works on these, but trying to increase the volume or skip to the next song is a little more difficult..<br />UPDATE:<br />I have since ordered another pair of earbuds from Amazon because again these ones were just not comfortable on my ears .I purchased the<br />“iLuv TB100 Wireless Earbuds” in rose gold . They ranked in the top five most comfortable earbuds for small ears. The reviews were great, and they are a good pair of earbuds . BUT they do not  compare to the sound quality of these earbuds! Even though in the reviews, a lot of people bragged about the sound quality of them, (they must have never purchased this brand. Lol.)

191698,2,Not nearly as impressive as I'd hoped,"I already own two pair of the Jabra Elite 75t headphones and all of my statements are in comparison to them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Sony headphones did not stand out in the ways I needed, to convince me to keep them.<br /><br />I am a man in my early 50's. According to my latest hearing test, I still have excellent hearing.<br /><br />The foam plugs reached deeper into my ear canals and made both of them hurt almost right away. Changing sizes made no difference. It was the same pain I experienced, with the foam hearing protection earplugs I wore, while running overhead crane at a steel company.<br /><br />I noticed no difference in passive sound isolation when compared to the silicone ones used by Jabra. However, they did not lose the, ""airtight seal"" when talking or chewing food. This prevented any outside noises from leaking in.<br /><br />One noticable advantage was that they did not feel like they might fall out of my ears. The Jabra's have done so on more than one occasion.<br /><br />Active noise isolation was, in my opinion, no better than the Jabra 's.<br /><br />Control options for the touch functions were frustratingly limited. Having to sacrifice one set of desired functions to prioritize another, meant I would always have to access my phone.<br /><br />Sound quality was a tiny bit clearer to me. I was definitely able to distinguish more instruments on the Sony's. I sampled several different songs on different devices. I played one song at a time, repeating it, until I had sampled all three headsets before connecting them to next device.<br /><br />However, I might be one of the rare individuals able to notice this, as I was musically trained. I played violin in orchestra since 5th grade and am higher than average at distinguishing between individual sounds.<br /><br />Most people might not notice any difference at all.<br /><br />Bass was noticeably weaker, in comparison, as was the overall volume.<br /><br />I did not notice the larger size of the headphones or any weight difference when using them. The battery life and recharge times was superior, but I did not like that the charging case was larger.<br /><br />Also, it would have been nice if the charging case itself, was waterproof.",[],B094C4VDJZ,B096WPKZNR,AE5SAXWYMRMDFM3PRLYRFHAVSSHA,2023-04-15 18:17:36.233,1,True,499
580906,5,One very effective archival device!,"I bought this and a variety of 25, 50 and 100GB disks, then spent days making secure copies of everything important to me - basically my digital life for the past 30+ years.  It took a lot longer to make the copies than I expected, but I didn't take into account the mass of data I was attempting to back up.  Now that it is done, I have the peace of mind that comes from having one copy set in the bank safety deposit box, and another stored in a secret place on my property.<br /><br />For decades I've upgraded to the newest, largest storage available.  I suffered data loss on occasion simply because I didn't have enough backup media.  Now, with 100GB at a time, I know close to a terabyte of data is more secure than ever.  This is a resource I will pass on to my children, who can find out a lot about their ancestors.<br /><br />I safeguarded my data using an old copy of Nero Burning Rom - a wonderful surprise.  Even a product almost a decade old had no problems doing all the work for me!  Not bad!<br /><br />Now, with this drive and the ability to store up to 100GB in one fell swoop, I sleep better.  The copies are offline.  Nobody can hack them.  I'm a professional security guru.  I know my business and an well protected, so it is highly unlikely anyone will be able to hack my system.  Even if someone tries a ransomeware attack, I can laugh in their faces!  I am covered.<br /><br />This is a more or less ""bare drive"" in a box.  The USB interface gives on demand access, and I have yet to find a computer it will not work with.  Using it with my antique Nero software, I have a complete and secure solution for the protection of my financial and personal life.  If there is ever a disaster, all I have to do is reformat affected drives, if needed install Windows, then apply my backups and I'm fully back in business.<br /><br />Though not cheap, this proved to be a wonderful tool for protecting my data.

202610,1,BUY ANY KINDLE DEVICE FROM BESTBUY. AT LEAST BESTBUY WILL REPLACE IT IF THEY CANT FIX IT.,"I bought this tablet and straight out of the box, it charges and drops to 0% . It then charged and held it‘s charge but that was my first experience. No kids touched it…. No wrong cable or anything. So, I’ve been having trouble with the fire 7 and the 8. One uses micro usb and the other uses usbC. The 8 holds a charge forever… I couldn’t be happier, but there are times where it just won’t charge. I went through this with the fire 7 and after a few times, AMAZON won’t replace the product. Now I know how kids are… putting things where they shouldn’t be and trying to charge it themselves, but in my case, that’s not the issue. I use my children’s  tablets for educational purposes only. My kids sit down with no cables or anything else to mess up any ports. They’re used solely for abc mouse, taken and put away.  So after a few months, they slowly decline and the fire 7 wont hold a charge at all. I’ve troubleshot the hell out of this thing and the end result is these things just suck. The 8 is better, but now it’s having a hard time charging. I’ve tried it all.  Usually Amazon is good about returning and troubleshooting but in my own personal experience and the hassle of this freaking device, I say go ahead and PURCHASE THIS DEVICE FROM BESTBUY AND GET THE WARRANTY WHERE GEEKSQUAD WILL EITHER FIX OR REPLACE THE ITEM. I’ve Spent such a long time on the phone troubleshooting and the problem is that it just sucks. I’m shocked to see 7th gen still for sale. It’s such a jip. Abc mouse works with 8 gen and up so I’m just going to begin the switch with brand new devices, purchased from BESTBUY. This is the first time I’ve had issues with the fire 8 but I know it’s simply inevitable. It’ll be replaced twice and that’s it. I know for a fact that my kids did not mess this device up because of how strict I am with screen time and I’m always with them while they’re on screen time.",[],B07WDDT3G5,B087DPYNYP,AGT6GFWCEAG7SDEQHZN2AW2MBLKA,2023-02-14 12:07:04.749,1,True,499
289312,4,Get this vertical stand,"(Item: Kuzy Laptop Stand Vertical - MacBook Vertical Stand Upright - Vertical Laptop Holder Desk Stand, Closed Mac Dual Laptop Stand MacBook Holder Stand for Desk - Vertical Laptop Stand 2 Slot, Black)<br /><br />Wether you get this one or another brand, don’t choose a cheaper, lighter stand. They all look good in the listing pics. This is one of those products you'll want to choose correctly the first time. A good one will easily last more than a decade throughout your various laptop upgrades.<br /><br />Out of the box, this one stands beautifully weighing in at just over 1 lb. If you use your laptop in clamshell mode, you’d be hard pressed to find a significantly better stand. 1 lb may not sound like much but, it's very weighty (which is a good thing)! There are quite a few vertical stands that look similar but are (literally) half the weight of this one. When you dock your laptop here, you’ll have zero concerns about it tipping/falling over. It is solid.<br /><br />I selected the Black color. It’s perfect for my desktop setting. The design is simple, clean and modern. The width of both slots are adjustable with the included Allen wrench. And, the silicone padding protects my devices. It easily held my brothers 16” MacBook Pro M2 Max (just under 5 lbs).<br /><br />If I was forced to nitpick about something, I wish they had included a smaller 1/2” lip on both sides of the stand. Just enough height to maybe rest your phone or a smaller tablet on without covering too much of its display. Not a major gripe at all, mind you. And, it’s something I would only use once in a while. But, would’ve been nice just to have. That aside, however, I really have no complaints.<br /><br />The first Kuzy product I bought was a case for my then-new, 2013 MacBook Air. The case held up through 5 years of heavy traveling. And, currently, I still use it as a media player in my office. Back then, they were a brand new company to me. Today, they’re a brand I confidently buy from. This stand is an easy reccomendation for consideration.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BprZ74z0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BprZ74z0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BprZ74z0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SUWtDjgSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SUWtDjgSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SUWtDjgSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71q+Gnpu1FL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71q+Gnpu1FL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71q+Gnpu1FL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09T234S75,B0BXZ29XK9,AFVPUVTE47PWDS5EPLEORKE4NRYA,2023-04-03 03:50:10.487,6,False,499
512871,5,"For me, a perfect set of features","I've been on a quest for the perfect mouse jiggler for quite a while. I started out by using glass container lids and drinking glasses to fool laser mice into producing random patterns on the screen. This worked, but was very fiddly and not easy to keep going.<br /><br />I tried some new USB plug in electronic jigglers, but I don't like the idea of directly connecting a data device. The mechanical jigglers available during the past couple of years were expensive and noisy. Nothing seemed to be 'just right.'<br /><br />Then - I saw this device. It's priced right; there's no direct data connection; it has perfectly quiet operation; and while not tested by me yet, the battery life should logically be great.<br /><br />First, the device is made in the U.S. What? Yes, it's labeled all over as ""Made in America."" Not a big deal, but interesting. Secondly, the device is simple and to the point. There's a built in AA battery activated the first time by a paper pull tab. The case is secured by two medium size screws. Notice I didn't say 'tiny screws.' When and if I replace the battery myself, I'll appreciate working with larger than microscopic screws.<br /><br />Third, the yin-yang rotating pattern works well for moving the mouse cursor slowly in different directions depending on how you place the mouse sensor on the device. My Bluetooth mouse has a laser sensor off to one side, so the mouse must be set slightly off center on the jiggler. The jiggler is large enough to allow me to do this without the mouse hanging off the edge. Nice that the manufacturer anticipated this...<br /><br />I'm guessing this jiggler uses an inexpensive clock movement with a second hand function to move the disc. The mouse pointer eventually moves to the edge of the display, but still manages to tell the OS that it's moving. (The included quick guide mentions this, and I can confirm it works.) A clock movement should run for 1+ years as claimed by this device, with no need for an on/off button - super convenient.<br /><br />I'm very happy I happened onto this device and I recommend it highly as an ideal solution for those looking for a simple, reliable, affordable, and *safe* mouse jiggler!",[],B0BMT3936M,B0BMT3936M,AGBX63FAPQQSRGMGV4YVYTB32SRA,2023-01-14 21:52:33.327,4,False,499
116640,4,Decent Replacement,"My old Logitech WAVE keyboard and mouse is showing its age.  The keys are fading and the mouse has been dropped so often its begining to stutter.  So I was looking for a dependable backup system for when the day comes and I found the E-YOOSO wireless keyboard and mouse combo.<br /><br />This is a 2.4G wireless setup that seems stable and will connect up to 10m (33 feet).  Its nice not to have to install any drivers. It comes with a USB receiver that can connect both the keyboard and mouse, and can be used separately. The keyboard has a comfortable touch and typing feel, and features a palm rest and folding holder for added comfort. I like a keyboard with some lip that lets it be handled without touching off any keys.  The mouse is grippy with a stripe pattern on the side to prevent slipping.<br /><br />This combo has some advanced features including an automatic power-saving function, which will automatically enter sleep mode after a period of inactivity to save power. It claims to be splash-proof which I'll have to see before I believe it.  But the panel has a waterproof conductive membrane and multiple drainage holes for double protection.  I'll try it out in the pool this summer and let you know how that works out.  LOL! J/K.  The advert says it has a an ABS injection-molded body, making it stable and non-toxic. But seriously, I like that the keyboard is easy to clean and any liquid that may get on it has a way to drain.<br /><br />The wireless mouse has 3 adjustable DPI levels (1000/1600/2400) for sensitivity adjustment and smooth movement on smooth surfaces. It also has a symmetry design that makes it suitable for both right-handed and left-handed users.  That's a definite plus because after years of right handed use, I have had to learn to use the mouse in my left hand.  This mouse is much like my Logitech MX300 though without the batteries, it's much lighter.<br /><br />Overall, the E-YOOSO wireless keyboard and mouse combo is a great option for those who want a comfortable, ergonomic, and reliable set of wireless peripherals for their computer or laptop.

826599,3,Retractable cable is the distinguishing feature,"Update 2023-Feb-25:<br />So far, I just used 2-prong plugs but now that I put the power strip to another location where I have grounded plugs and large-size plugs, I find the orientation of the outlets not very practicable. The ground points inward, therefore the cables meet in the middle. For large plugs that have equally sized prongs it is possible to plug them in in either direction.<br />I took another picture and attached it. I feel that the use of the power strip can be largely limited when using grounded plugs.<br /><br />--- previously ---<br />The power strip comes without extra manual, but the packaging states some specs: Input Voltage AC100-125 ~50/60 Hz; Rated Power: 10A Max 125V; USB Output: DC5V-3A, 9v-2A, 12V-1.66A.<br /><br />There's no spec regarding the surge protection capacity -- the marketing description talks about 2000 Joules but in a customer question the seller states ""Yes it's a surge protector power strip. 120~180 joules.""<br />I think that's contradicting and confusing.<br /><br />The 4AC outlets are grounded and with 1 USB-A and 1 USB-C, the power strip is equipped for ordinary and common scenarios. With regard to the number of outlets, this power strip with the given compact form factor ranges only in the middle field of the competitors, but the retractable cable of course needs half of the space of the inner part of the device; therefore, it really depends on what someone's major criterion is when selecting a power strip.<br />The fact that the cable is retractable makes it a good choice for situations where the cable shall visually disappear -- to me, that is the only distinguishing feature of this power strip.<br />Rolling in and out the cable works smoothly -- I measured about 53 inch cable length from the plug to the point where the cable enters the housing -- the marketed cable length of 5 ft is probably meant to be measured from the plug to the outer, opposite edge of the housing.<br />The cable and plug are standard round and not flat, what would be even nicer.<br />The power strip can be hung with the attachable hook that is part of the product.

865306,4,Sturdy messenger bag,"This messenger bag is sturdy and well made. The stitching is strong and even. The main straps have metal devices on the buckles that snap into metal loops on the body of the bag; that means that to open and close the main compartment of the bag it isn't necessary to unbuckle the straps. One can just press the snap devices and release those, without moving the buckles. I mention that especially because I didn't notice it when I first looked at this bag on Amazon. I was going to reject this bag because of the hassle of having to buckle and unbuckle the straps any time I wanted to open it. You don't have to do that.<br /><br />The small compartment attached to the front of the bag doesn't have such a snap in device, so you do have to buckle it and unbuckle it.<br /><br />The bag has more compartments than was at first apparent. Many options to carry your stuff. If fully extended the sides are four inches deep, so fully stuffed the bag has a large capacity.<br /><br />It is made of stiff leather which is fairly heavy. In my opinion this is proper since a softer, more luxurious garment leather wouldn't hold up to the abuse that a briefcase is likely to get. If you want to soften it and preserve it a good leather conditioner would help; you should probably do that anyway since real leather can dry out and even sometimes crack when it gets old.<br /><br />Someone else mentioned that the bag smells. It does; it smells like the tanning chemicals, I think. Personally I don't find the odor to be very strong on my particular bag.<br /><br />I am downrating this item by one star because of what I consider a minor design flaw. The main straps appear to be longer than could ever be necessary even if the bag is fully stuffed. I suppose this might be used to strap something to the front of the bag, under the straps, but anything so held wouldn't be secure. As it is the overlong straps are going to dangle and get in the way. One could trim them, but they are stitched all the way around the edges- a nice detail- so of course I don't want to do that.<br /><br />All in all a very nice piece of luggage.

748639,1,Microsoft wireless mouse model 1383 of Microsoft mouse 4000 is a piece of junk.,"I've been using a number of Microsoft mouse units since the late 80s with the early versions of Windows 3.0 was issued. I have never had the issues, that I have had with this Microsoft wireless mouse model 1383 of the Microsoft wireless mouse 4000. This has to be the biggest piece of junk that I ever purchased. It eats batteries in a few months. It also has a cheap on/off switch. When I first got it, I had no problems. After about four months the pointer started jumping all over the place. I replaced the batteries, but that only fixed it for a few weeks. So I ended up switching it off and then on for the pointer to stabalize. That didn't last long. After a while the pointer would track and then jump somewhere else. It seemed as if the power switch would not engage in the full on mode, but seemed to back off to where it just barely stayed on. I ended up disconnecting this unit, and replacing it with an older wired Microsoft mouse. It works just fine. I just don't like having the wire get in the way all the time, but at least the pointer is under control. After using the wireless mouse in question, I found out that I could not highlight sections of a site in order to cut and paste. It would only copy the whole paragraph or nothing, but certainly not any words or single sentences. My old wired version works perfectly. This wireless mouse has been nothing but trouble, so I must assume that it is a cheaply made piece of crap. Finally I must complain about the battery cover. I had to press the one button before I could PRY open the battery compartment cover using one of my wife's metal nail files. I even tried pressing both buttons, and it never made a difference. If I ever buy another wireless mouse, it will never be one from Microsoft. Still I have to mention that every other Microsoft mouse, that purchased prior to this one worked fine, but it has been several years since I decided to replace a mouse unit. This new one just feels cheap and poorly made, so I am not surprised that it never worked as I needed it to work. And yes, before anyone asks, I plugged my wired mouse into the same port that I used for crappy, cheaply made wireless one, and the wired mouse worked perfectly. Oh how the great have fallen.

I don't want to exaggerate and say this will blow away your Premium headphones, but they will surprise you in many ways.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />-Borrows design aesthetic from Sony WH-1000-XM4 which is a good thing I feel.

These headphones have good treble and highs, but not much BASS at all. This leaves certain genres of music sounding a bit flat and tinny.<br /><br />-The noise cancellation is just okay. I got a lot of external noise coming through with ANC on.<br /><br />-Even though these headphones support high-res audio, your high resolution is wasted on these headphones.<br /><br />-Gaming Mode and Music modes sound identical.

826431,5,So much better than a fish finder!!!,"So right off the bat I have about the most expensive fish finder you can get on my boat. And truth be told, it does work......But not very well to say the least. It interprets anything in the water as a fish. Old tire (school of fish), floating log (big school of fish) and seaweed as a whale (seriously it shows its basically a whale) so needless to say based on these facts my fish finder isnt so great. Now its good to get you in a rough area of where the fish are, but thats about it. Once you've narrowed it down to a quarter acre sized area you than have to rely on intuition and time to get a bite. Something both my kids and I dont possess. They are easily bored after a few minutes. So to keep their interest in fishing I got one of these cameras.<br /><br />In all honesty I didnt expect much based on the cost. (My fish finder was in the thousands so good could this be) however I am happy to say that I was very wrong. Not only is this great for viewing the actual fish under water, but my kids absolutely love it. Seeing the fish swimming around and having them guide me to where to cast my line is pretty much their new favorite past time. Anyhow let me roll into a few pros/cons<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Much cheaper than a fish finder<br />-IMHO much more useful than a fish finder<br />-Great clarity of camera<br />-Bright screen that you can see in sun light<br />-Comes in a nice carrying case and is easy setup<br />-Super easy to use, no complex apps or setup necessary, toss it in and turn it on<br /><br />Cons:<br />-As its tethered it can get caught in the prop or on underwater debris<br /><br />Outside of the one con in my book this is the ultimate addition to any fisherman that doesnt want to spend all day fishing. Which I really dont mind, but theres no way I can keep the kids entertained on an 8+ hour fishing trip....especially if we arent catching. Some may say this is cheating, but than again so is using a fish finder. I personally think of it more as a tool than a cheat....But thats just my .02",[],B09QBY1LX5,B09QBY1LX5,AHWCKHDQBGJCHRKBMIULJ55L65KA,2023-03-02 01:12:14.300,0,False,498
709850,2,Really flimsy - cheap for a reason,"These mast mounts are cheap for a reason.  They probably cost about as much to produce as a soda can.  The metal is flimsy, and thin.  The lack of rigidity in the material makes it hard to tighten down the mast and keep it from moving.  I have no confidence in these staying in the position I placed them.<br /><br />I used them to mount a wireless point-to-point bridge which was very light, &lt;100g/.25lb. and will present almost no wind load.  The base has a single column of slots down the center to screw the mount into the fascia board or whatever your mounting base is, and that makes it incredibly unstable.  Most antenna mounts have a minimum of 4 mounting holes (1 on the top left, 1 on the top right, 1 on the bottom left, and 1on the bottom right of the bracket) which makes them stable.  This mount with two holes in the center gives it almost no ability to withstand any side to side force like when the wind blows it left to right.<br /><br />Once you have the mount adjusted and positioned the way you want it, there is a single screw on each side of the mast bracket that you tighten to fix it into position.  Those single screws can't be tightened down enough to hold the mast securely.  In our case, after cranking on the tightening screws the mast still drooped as soon as a little weight was put on it from the Cat6 cable.<br /><br />I have zero confidence in this mast staying in position over time, and I regret ordering this over a more sturdy mast mount.  The time that will be wasted having to readjust and tighten this will far exceed the extra $10 -$20 on a real mount.  Keep in mind, I'm only expecting this to support a piece of equipment with hardly any weight on it, and I still have no confidence in it.<br /><br />Not to totally bash the product, it does have a few good features.  it doesn't look like it will rust, the base includes a pole mount which is actually much more secure than the screw mount, and it includes some worm gear clamps.<br /><br />I can't think of many applications where I would use this mount.  Again, I would recommend spending an extra $10-$20 for a real mast mount.",[],B0BFQQ7GS8,B0C4KYNBTK,AF4CCJICRABUHQIH2VHTAE5O7FDA,2023-01-14 23:10:06.207,1,True,498
950616,5,Great for every day use,"Overall, I've been very happy with these, and am purchasing a new set of these same headphones after 14 months of heavy daily use.  My first set is just starting to have trouble with losing sound in the right ear.  Also, the little rubber piece that protects the charging port broke off months ago, and I only recently finally lost it.  The battery still holds its charge well - I haven't noticed any reduction in charge time.<br /><br />I really love this over-ear clip design.  I hate ear buds, and used the wired version of these same headphones for years until finding this wireless version.  Not having noise cancellation is a plus for me, since I want to listen to music but still be able to hear when my kids need to get my attention.  Also, this wire design works well - I wear it under the neck, and it's adjustable with a little sliding piece, though I never use that.  Some similar over-ear headphones have a shorter wire that goes around the back of the neck, which is super inconvenient if you have long hair.<br /><br />The weak point of the KOSS headphones for me has always been eventually losing sound in one side.  However, this happened much more quickly in the wired models (maybe 6 months vs. 14 months wireless).  The wired ones can easily get caught on knobs and things when you walk around, causing tugs on the wire, which is probably what leads to the problem.  Wireless obviously doesn't have this issue as much, since it only has the short wire between earpieces, though if you are someone to stash them in a pocket/purse when not using, it would be advisable to be very gentle when pulling them out again so as not to tug on the wire connections to the earpiece.  I was not diligent in this, and so am not surprised that they eventually gave out.  Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Sound is really good in these, and I have had no trouble pairing these with my phone (Samsung S7).  When battery is low, it starts to make a little chime every couple minutes during playback.  The range is acceptable, but not great - it sometimes will start to cut out if my phone is on the other side of the house from where I am, but it's not a big deal.  You can also accept incoming calls through the headset.",[],B082FP4PB3,B082FP4PB3,AHDH7ACWPPB5UO2ZUCHOKDWKAZBQ,2023-03-04 19:44:46.225,1,True,498
404540,5,I really like this,"I have a 2,600 sq-ft house on three floors.  The old router had been in the basement and worked reasonably well until I started working from home in 2020.  With the computer on the second floor it made for a slow connection.  I ended up connecting the router and modem to an unused coaxial cable on the second floor and everything was fine until last summer, when download speeds dropped to near zero.  After repeated visits from the internet provider, we determined that the coax cable from the basement to the 2nd floor was bad.  Why a cable buried in the wall would suddenly do that, I don't understand.  But the modem and router went back into the basement, which was almost as bad as the bad coax cable had been.  It also made for a bad connection to the master bedroom and the garage.  The internet provider suggested a mesh router.  I looked at a lot and after weeks, I finally picked this one.  It has three units and they are spread around the house and different floors.  Now, no matter where any of us are, we have very good wi-fi signals.<br /><br />I was worried about connectivity with wi-fi 6.0 and everything has worked fine except for an old IPod mini from the mid-90's.  For whatever reason, when I type in the wi-fi password, it keeps saying it's incorrect.  I'm not worried about it since the mini is plugged into an alarm clock and if I ever need to update the music on it, it will be connected to a PC.<br /><br />The app is nice and one can also connect to the wi-fi on a PC, which I like too.  I especially like that I can priortize connections, so my work PC is set as a priority and if someone(s) is streaming a movie it does not affect me.<br /><br />I have two items plugged into the ethernet ports on two of the devices and they both work fine.<br /><br />I'm quite happy with it.  It was a nice price and they both look nice.  I was worried about the signal since this is the first wi-fi router I've had that does not have any visible antennas, but reception has been good everywhere in the house.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone needing a mesh wi-fi.",[],B085Z35GY6,B09HLD1C4F,AGVUERALDGBUASQK6Y5446VKQ3WQ,2023-02-09 20:58:41.245,2,True,498
209233,4,A Decorative Record Player for Any Setup,"There are more things about this record player that shocked me than I thought there would be. Not only is it much larger than I assumed it would be, but there are several ways you can set up these speakers to fit any type of setup you might have.<br /><br />The main record player has an excellent protective cover lid to protect your records from dust and other particles that may interfere with the needle, and there are multiple different playback speed modes and features to choose from when you play your records. It also has two large speaker units that serve as the output for the record player, but there is also built-in Bluetooth functionality for those that prefer to listen to music directly out of their phone, tablet or other connected device. You can also set up the components in different positions to work best with the space you have available to you, whether you need to put one piece on top of a shelf and the rest underneath, or you need to stack them, place them side to side, or any numerous other configurations that are within reach. This is definitely something I am glad they thought of as my desk has limited space and being able to spread out the speakers is a huge benefit.<br /><br />As far as the sound quality goes, the speakers are more full and vibrant than I expected, but occasionally I did notice some quality drops when using records, but I don't know if that is due to my records having any scratches or if it is from the needle not balancing properly. However, when using Bluetooth with my phone, the quality issues go away completely and most of my tracks sound excellent. With Bluetooth the speakers also seem to get louder, in my opinion, than when playing records. Once again, I am unsure if this is how it's designed or whether there is an issue with my records or the needle. I will say that even if you just use it as a Bluetooth speaker, it adds a retro vibe to whatever room you might be using it in as the system looks very elegant. The speakers are also very dense, and I believe that everything was made with quality materials in mind.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent, unique record player/Bluetooth speaker that most people would enjoy. However, if you don't own any records, then there are other Bluetooth speakers you might be interested in but at a lower cost. I would recommend this record player, but only for those specifically looking for this product or style.",[],B0BGPPGRRX,B0BQ712MZM,AF7SO6JG76JZKBKRBXAVQJOJBPHQ,2023-01-04 06:24:27.853,0,False,498
554690,3,"OK, but could so easily be better","The height and width are just what I needed to hold my two monitors at a healthy height for me. It would be nice if it were a little deeper, but I knew the dimensions when I bought it so can’t really have any complaint about that.<br /><br />But there are several annoyances, that it would be so easy for the manufacturer to fix. First is assembly. It’s like getting something from Ikea, complete with the wordless, inscrutable assembly instructions, but MOSTLY not too bad. All the first steps are straightforward, though a tad tedious. But the last assembly step, putting on the outer legs, is horrible. It’s hard enough fishing the screws through the relevant holds then desperately trying to get them both threaded into the bottom of the top surface before things start wiggling around and separating. But once you’ve done that the Allen wrench supplied for tightening them can’t actually go around, so you have to spend nearly half an hour fiddling with it through tiny fractions of rotations and then resetting the Allen wrench, four times over for the four screws. They really should supply a more appropriate tool, perhaps a second, slightly shorter Allen wrench?<br /><br />And once it’s all built it sags in the middle. Not a lot, but with a monitor on each end enough to be annoying. The reason for the sag is they have rubber feet on the legs on the ends, but NONE on the middle support, so that latter ends up being a tiny bit shorter. But the overall thing is long enough that a tiny bit of difference is more than enough to make a noticeable, annoying sag. I put some shims under the middle support and that makes it much better; but we shouldn’t have to do that, it should come with the middle support having matching rubber feet or whatever, to make it the same height as the end legs.<br /><br />A slight cosmetic issue is the unsightly holes for the connectors of the middle support. It would be nice if they supplied some black plugs to fill them in. I’ve just used a little bit of black electrical tape to cover them, which makes things look much tidier.<br /><br />End of story, it’s now meeting my needs nicely, but it was a minor ordeal getting to this point.",[],B09QWC568X,B0BWJRB5GW,AFZ5SJPS4F43TXY5DUWN5EU2U4YA,2023-01-04 18:10:34.507,2,True,498

Living in Western PA, in the winter we get a lot of gray, gloomy days and sunlight is at a premium.  The test for this camera was if it would stay charged with the solar panel.  To set it up, first you'll need to download the Vicohome app.  The process was straightforward and I didn't have any problems connecting.  Mounting the camera and solar panel likewise was straightforward.<br /><br />Once connected there are lots of options you can set including an alarm schedule, notification of events, SD or HD recording modes, how many seconds of recording up to 20 seconds/per event and many others.<br />The area I am covering is my front door and sidewalk.  I found that the ""medium"" motion sensitivity setting was best and camera needed to be aimed downward so as not to falsely trigger when every car went past.  On the high setting, squirrels and birds would set it off.  The solar panel works well and battery level has remained nearly fully charged in spite of frequent recordings.<br /><br />The pictures, videos and audio recordings are clear but the camera often starts recording later than what I would prefer.  I have it set to 20 seconds of recording time, (which is the maximum) but I'd like to be able to choose 30 or 40 seconds.  The VicoHome app is good and fairly straightforward.  It's easy to see photos and videos and they can be stored locally if an SD card is installed, (not included) or on the cloud.  A subscription is offered if you want to expand the storage capacity on the cloud.<br /><br />Bottom line: Decent security camera.  App is easy to use and provides a number of useful features such as scheduling, sensitivity settings, the ability to activate an ""alarm"" and to speak with a person at the door from a remote location.  Recording times are limited to 20 seconds and recording often begins when the subject is close to the door rather than prior to.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VFWi6TuzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VFWi6TuzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VFWi6TuzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61q35K9TcLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61q35K9TcLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61q35K9TcLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Sg-GD69IL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Sg-GD69IL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Sg-GD69IL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Z2vuZXsCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Z2vuZXsCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Z2vuZXsCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qXpKKjX7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qXpKKjX7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qXpKKjX7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BN5YJKZJ,B0CB69GS1H,AFN7TLKO5YF2DGRTUSGXQVCKS3FA,2023-01-19 05:03:21.496,0,False,498

The pairing is a pain, but once you learn how to do it it gets easier. The camera's powered by USB, so it's an indoor camera only which is something to keep in mind. What's awesome is you can put the SD card in, and not have to pay for a monthly plan like other cameras.<br /><br />The video quality is very good in both will let areas and dark rooms. The IR absolutely lights up an entire room. Primarily I use this camera to monitor various areas of my basement for water leakage and to remotely view it when I'm away from home. The motion detection is very very sensitive to the point of being almost unusable, any light movement from the Sun or clouds going by will trigger it.<br /><br />Overall for $20 a camera I'm very very happy for this application. I also have three Arlo cameras monitoring the house, however I feel like the Energizer cameras record more versus not having the Arlo cloud plan to store everything. I'm up to five cameras now, so it's very nice to have full coverage and not have to pay $120 a camera.<br /><br />Overall if you have an area with good Wi-Fi coverage and outlets, these cameras are the cheapest and best way to remotely monitor them. The app works well, and I've even gotten the remote plugs which are about $20 for four, I put one on my wireless router to reboot it without having to go under the cabinets, and I use the others for lighting control.<br /><br />Overall, once you get to know the products and have applications for them, the Energizer connect products are actually quite good. I just wish they'd get the water leak detector back in stock which would really really help me out.<br /><br />Edit: The Alro cameras have now become worthless because I had a three month intro plan I had no idea existed, so the cameras no longer function as a security device without paying $12.99 a month. The Energizer cameras still function and don't require a monthly fee.  Arlo is an absolute ripoff.

I'm going to point out some negatives first, but be aware that overall I do love this light (so keep these negatives in mind, but be sure to read through to the positives as well).<br /><br />For this application it has two distinct drawbacks that can be seen in the attached image - the diffuser does not do a great job of actually diffusing the light from the individual leds, and in the ""cold light"" mode only half the leds are illuminated.  As you can see from the picture there is a grid of leds, half are the 6000K (bright white/cold) leds and the other half are 2600K (very soft, almost yellow/warm) leds.  because of this you can only get ""full"" brightness in the ""natural"" setting which illuminates both sets of leds.  This isn't that big of a deal because even with only the cold leds lit the light is *very* bright at 100% brightness.  This pic was taken at the lowest brightness, but the individual leds are still quite noticeable even at 100% intensity.  Because of this weak diffusion I had to add an additional diffuser in my application.<br /><br />Now the positives.  This light is a very convenient size (4.375 x 2.125 x 0.75 thick) and the light extends all the way to the edges (it's borderless).  It also is very bright at max intensity.  It is working for several hours on a charge (I've generally been running at high brightness) and it can work even while being charged.  It comes with a variety of mounting options - I'm not using any of them, but they seem useful and well thought out.  The light does not get hot when operating, even at full brightness.<br /><br />For my application this light turns out to be almost perfect (with the additional diffuser) - so even though I was tempted to remove a star for the weak diffusion I decided to add it back because of the overall ergonomics and how well it seems to work.  I also suspect that the lack of diffusion would not be an issue if you used this for its intended purpose of a selfie light.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41V6SH8UB6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41V6SH8UB6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41V6SH8UB6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BWNF2L2S,B0BWNF2L2S,AEJK5MZVU26ZI6N6PLYBTTRBE35A,2023-04-17 15:21:34.515,0,False,498
336702,1,(Still) Needs More Instructions,"It took quite a while to figure the set-up of this device. For the instructions that were included, they may have well just left them out. It appears the instructions are geared towards iPhone users. I’m an Android Gal but I can usually translate such things over to Android but no so much with this device and the included document (I can’t even call it instructions).<br /><br />The instructions fails to tell you that you need to start the set-up on a computer so that you can “bound” the email. I figured out that “bound” is probably the same as “verify”. Unfortunately, once you “bind” an email you can’t update it or change it (per the website). That makes no sense the way some people change email addresses but I suppose you could just factory reset the device and start over with a new “bound” email if necessary.<br /><br />I installed a micro SD Card but can’t figure out where to get the videos that are saved on it. The instructions indicate you have to go online (not from the app) and download them from a certain area but I can’t, for the life of me, find this area to download the recorded videos from.<br /><br />When I try to connect the app to my Amazon account that function does not work and I get an error message indicating “Oops! That page can’t be found” I have yet to figure this function out so right now it’s a no go with my Alexa account. I reached out to support. I’ll let you know if they ever answer back.<br /><br />The two-way talk feature is very garbled in my situation. I can’t get it to sound very clear at all.<br /><br />The camera itself has pretty good video quality. The camera will move once you finally connect it to the app and do your movements from the app. Also, you can set the camera to automatically follow movement.<br /><br />I set-up to get notifications for movements but I have received no notifications at all and there has been plenty of movement.<br /><br />I cannot recommend that anyone waste their hard earned money on this camera unless you like troubleshooting (and are good at it).",[],B0BML78L2T,B0BML78L2T,AHGJF4AVNTJ67RKSZURG7U7DT6TA,2023-01-07 22:17:26.276,0,False,498
784125,4,5 Years And Still Look And Operated Like New,"First let me start with the pros and cons.<br />Pros:<br />Noise Cancelation Works Well<br />Sound quality is good but slightly lacking in bass<br />The muff material is comfortable<br />Easily adjustable and holds adjustment<br />The muff fits over ear, close for me but I have big ears<br />Durable (I will address this below)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Lacking bass<br />Sound Cancelation works on batteries<br />The microphone sound quality<br />Some devices will not respond to volume control<br /><br />I have used these everyday for 5 years, from working in the marine industry to the trucking industry and using them at home for my Xbox and computer and they look and work great. There are very little signs these have had such heavy use and I do not use the case that came with it. The muff material is comfortable and is durable. The muffs are big enough to surround my ear though it's barely big enough. I can wear and do wear these for hours without any issues. They do not make me sweaty and they seem to breathe pretty good. In high humidity areas such as the gulf coast you will get some dampness after wearing them for several hours but you will also be damp just from the environment. The adjustment for these have held mostly since I bought it and adjusted it the first time. The only times I have had to readjust is after storing them in my bag when traveling with them packed away or after my wife uses them. The sound quality is good, as expected from Bose, the bass is lacking but that is not exactly surprising. The noise canceling abilities is pretty good, worked in an idling semi truck when I would watch a movie but the batteries that power the noise canceling last about 4 hours. I wish there was an option to have it plugged into a power source but that is just me. The microphone sounds quality is OK and definitely could have been improved but I don't usually use these to talk in the phone. I have found that some devices will not respond to the volume control though I can't rule out that being a device issue instead of a headphone issue.<br /><br />Overall I would buy these again if I needed to but unless my dog chews on them or I do something stupid and break them I don't see myself replacing these anytime soon.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81skqFIamkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81skqFIamkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81skqFIamkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91E7bcA4AWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91E7bcA4AWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91E7bcA4AWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00VW7U8X4,B0105VDCZ8,AF675VTLBUJ4A6FQSRWBR6SFGLAA,2023-03-14 11:02:35.792,0,False,498
464497,5,Love it!,"I've had a non-screen XP Pen until I wore the surface off when one of the nibs became scratchy - I've upgraded and I love it.<br />I have a couple of issues with it:<br />Firstly, which turned out not to be an issue, is that it takes a second or so to turn on - you have to leave your finger on the touch sensor - It's enough of a noticeable delay that I thought mine was broken as it only turned on after I'd started wiggling the power connection - so I thought mine was defective, but if you leave you finger on the sensor and wait, it does turn on ok!<br />Secondly, it comes with cords, but they're all super short! None of them would fit from the tablet to my computer / power source - they're all on the right side of the unit at the back, and my computer and wall socket are on my left.... So I had to buy 3 more much longer cables before I could use it, so keep that in mind when you buy it - unless your computer and power source is a very short distance away on the right, you will need longer cables.<br />After that everything is easy - the manual is online, the quick start guide gets you to it, as well as the driver and it's really easy to set up and use after that.<br />My previous XP Pen was a Deco Pro - and I adored the wheel on that - I really wish this one had that wheel with the outer rim and the inner touch pad, but it sadly doesn't. I'm right handed so I have the pen in my right hand, which means the buttons and wheel on the right side are effectively unusable, so I find I'm having to reach over when I want to rotate the screen (which is what I've assigned the right wheel to do), which is annoying - my left wheel is brush size and I use that more. I don't use the buttons at all because I find it easier to have my left hand on my keyboard where I have access to a lot more keys in a much smaller space so I can work faster - This ultimately would rock if it had the big Deco Pro wheel either on one side (with the ability to turn it up the other way for left handers) or one on each side - that would be my absolutely ideal tablet. In the meantime I'm happy with this :)","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81wxEAPtvxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81wxEAPtvxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81wxEAPtvxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07ZJLXDZP,B09S32P52Q,AGDONB5WIQDYSM2KITYPTTJAJASQ,2023-01-05 17:33:15.752,0,True,498
490974,4,Work from home IMPRESSIVE!,"This wireless noise canceling Bluetooth headset works crystal clear and connects quickly to my laptop. I somewhat work for a call center but I work from home and take multiple phone calls A-day. The software we use is Microsoft Teams & Voice for Pests + Soft Phone.<br />Don't get me wrong, this is by far the nicest headset I have ever used and definitely the most comfortable. With sponge on one side and that your piece is so soft it feels like a little marshmallow on your ear. The microphone is so noise canceling that I can't even hear myself speak into it which is very interesting but the noise cancel is Exquisite. The only downside to this is when my phone rings, the call will display on my screen on my laptop but the 1st ring doesn't come through. The phone doesn't make an audio ring sound until the 2nd call which can be somewhat vital when you work for a call center and the phone only rings 3 times before you miss a call so that's somewhat risky with this headset but other than that, the freedom to walk around my house while ""at work in"" Has been such a relief and enjoyment. I've been using this headset for about 4 days now and it's perfect other than the phone ringing.. there is also if you use Microsoft Teams, The notification pop up sound is extremely faint but that's very common for every Bluetooth device with that software. ..& I don't hate that at all!<br />I have been using this for a few days and I charge it every night but barely use any of the battery during my 9 hour daily shifts so if I did forget to charge it one night, I believe it would get me through at least 1 more day of a shift full time. I operate my phone thru the mouse on the laptop so I have not had the opportunity to answer calls or play with the volume.. I did turn the volume up and that seemed to work but I'm already hard-of-hearing as it is. .. But this headset is definitely very fancy and I am the envy of my coworkers regarding that. It's light but also heavy duty feeling because it's such a quality product I can tell. I just took away that 1 star because there is a lag in the phone ringing and that can be very dangerous when you work for a call center. Other than that, this is a perfect headset if you are in the market for a Bluetooth headset.",[],B0BNKWKRXX,B0BNKWKRXX,AFMC2NVRCDYET4JM6G5FLYDS2P2A,2023-03-10 21:04:37.015,0,False,498
310364,4,My go-to charger these days.,"Reviewing Tenergy T9688 (4 slot D-C-AA-AAA and does AAAA as well)<br />Purchased 08 Feb 2023<br />All slots hold officially supported battery sizes tightly.  (I have also used it for my tiny quad-A batteries and they work also.)<br />I probably should give it 5 stars but sometimes I think people tend not to believe a review if 5 stars are awarded by a user.<br />Charge time is moderate which is just what Tenergy advertises and it's just what I desire because the batteries last longer when gently charged.  The discharge/recharge cycle works fine, too.  I have no complaints.  It's rock solid just like my other Tenergy charger.<br />I also have a Tenergy TN162 8-slot AA charger since Juy 2021.  It works fine all this time.  No problems.<br />The 4 slot T9688 has a 500 milliamp USB port.  It's not worth much because practicalliy nothing functions on that little bit of power these days.  The USB port only works when the charger is not charging batteries.  I have a low draw USB lamp that uses 100 milliamperes.  I plugged it into the USB  port just for fun.  The light plugged into the USB port comes on.  If you then charge batteries, the light goes off...until the battery charging process finishes then the USB port is automatically re-energized and my lamp comes on again.  So, the USB port could be used to light a lamp to let you know it's done charging.  Or, maybe Arduino or Raspberry Pi users would want to use that port to trigger something fun when the battery charge process is done--like send an emaill or activate a buzzer?<br />I don't know what else to say.  The Tenergy chargers just do what they are supposed to do and they feel substantially weighted like high-quality materials probably comprise the devices.  I plan to get another 4-slot Tenergy so I'll have 2 of the 4-slot models because my aged Vanson BC1HU 4-slot chargers are getting very old and smelling of phenolic overheat...so the young strong Tenergy chargers are ready to step in and take over and keep me powered up.

422008,4,Almost a five star (see review),"Review of VETEK 1080 Video Camera Camcorder, 30MP Vlogging Camera with WiFi Digital Camera, 16X Digital Zoom Video Camera for YouTube, with 32GB SD Card, 2.4G Remote Control and Two Batteries（Red）<br /><br />Very nice quality for the price.  Great set of goodies, SD card, lens cap, mic, two batteries with charger are all quite nice.  The case is small, only the camera fits, not the mic; or you can put the mic and accessories and not the camera, which is what I am doing with it.<br /><br />I wanted this to use for a second video recorder for making painting videos and capturing a different angle to use for my editing.<br /><br />There is a problem with this camera’s design: the battery compartment is too close to the tripod screw hole.  This is a problem because it does not allow for practical use of a quick release plate.  Sure you can put one on, but it has to be removed every time you want to take out the battery or the SD Card, which I would have to do several times during a painting recording session.<br /><br />I overcame the problem because this cam is so lightweight that an unconventional arrangement is possible, and my cam now rests on a threaded screw into a threaded bar with several threaded hole locations to offset the camera clear of the plate, then I just loosen the bar by turning it a 1/4 turn to the side and it clears the compartment door (see photo).  This is my one complaint with this camera.  If the threaded opening was switched with the unthreaded opening (just a little in front of the other) this would not be needed.  If you plan to just hold the camera it is not a problem.  If you only need to change the battery or take out the card occasionally for your use, or don’t mind removing it from the tripod mount this is not a problem.  For me it was inconvenient.<br /><br />Nicely featured recorder, some surprising functions and features (slow motion and time lapse to name just two) for an inexpensive camera, video recorder.  I just wish that the threaded hole to attach to a tripod was even a quarter of an inch further from the battery compartment door, to allow for the use of a quick release device.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514l9REiTSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514l9REiTSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514l9REiTSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51nN+pxCa3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51nN+pxCa3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51nN+pxCa3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BRKJJTLM,B0BRKJJTLM,AFHXEW4IY2R67IE2YML27JK4P53A,2023-02-21 17:12:49.863,0,False,498
555226,5,Save yourself some time,"I spent a lot of time looking for a wake up light. So many options and considerations and often times, reading reviews don’t help. After an embarrassing amount of time I finally chose this one.<br /><br />This wake up light is packed with features and well thought out. Of course with more features there’s slightly more to learn…but it’s worth it.<br /><br />I almost went with another light that’s 3 X the cost of this one but found out the light only came on when the alarm sounded. That defeats the purpose. Also, this model has a lot more features than other models and at around $40 it’s a steal.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />~Attractive transition from warm/soft wake up light to a bright midday sun look. In other words, it’ll wake you up.<br /><br />~Lots of sound options. From relaxing rain to an old time bell (great if you’re motivated by irritation) to your favorite radio station, and many more.<br /><br />~RGB and mood light. There’sa whole bunch of options with these two. My favorite one is a reddish mood light that gently pulsates. I turn this one on before bed (it goes off in 30 minutes but you can program it for 5, 10, etc). It’s the right tone of red light and mesmerizing. This feature alone is worth the price for me because it has got me over my addiction of looking at my phone in bed.<br /><br />~Snooze button is easily accessible, on top, push down. Other models had you searching for a small button.<br /><br />~Many more options. This wake up light designer thought of it all. Yes, it takes a bit getting used to but anything new does. Personally, I prefer all the options. It insures it’ll fulfill most every need.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />~Durability? It too soon to tell. It’s made of plastic and at this price it’s expected.

I had my hotspot turned on for my kid’s iPad which prevented wireless CarPlay.<br />* As mentioned in another review, CarPlay is an app within the Zlink app. It works fine but it’s not always obvious how to get back to it.<br />* My iDrive controller stopped working with it. The controller works for the factory radio. Not sure why. I’ll investigate more.<br />  ** This resolved itself after leaving the car off overnight.<br /><br />The install took about an hour, and other than struggling to fit everything inside the dash, it was fairly easy.<br /><br />I’m yet to see if this is worth the cost compared to the internal module that works with the factory screen but time will tell.<br /><br />** Update: after having this for a few days, I revise my statement. It is a legit upgrade. The larger screen is very nice and now that I’ve adjusted to it, I think it is worth the cost. Everything works smoothly and I’ve retained the factory HU features as well.<br /><br />The only thing left is that I wish you could use the Media button to go to the CarPlay audio player. The Nav button takes you to the CarPlay Nav (if you’re in CarPlay) so I’d think similar could be done for media.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mjX11IpSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mjX11IpSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mjX11IpSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/817-Bsu2SdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/817-Bsu2SdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/817-Bsu2SdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09TKD9WBV,B09TKCDQRF,AEZDNGRDWOXJRKEL5E57677VIXXQ,2023-01-01 08:06:46.496,1,True,498
765855,4,"No complaints, they do what they say they do, work great with open keystone panels","I built a new mini-rack for my home network recently. I had an iwillink cat6 keystone patch panel (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BF8J3KYW/) that I replaced a couple of keystones with USB-A and USB-C, but I want to update it with a bit more color and some more USB.<br /><br />For this future retrofit, I bought a Monoprice blank panel (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09QFVVM5C/) and will use the leftover keystones from the previous project and some others I have on hand - Cat6 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XWB63VT from an old 3d-printing network project), USB-A 3.x (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078935SFG), USB-C (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z947FRN), and LC fiber (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08JMFG2FQ).<br /><br />But to label special ports (like external connection uplinks, PoE ports, etc), I wanted to get some colored couplers. Picked a pack of these green ones, and the same brand of yellow (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRSFQ7D7, which will have pretty much the same review since it's effectively the same product).<br /><br />The couplers come in 5 zipper bags of 5 each, in a cardboard box. This is better than loose, as I don't usually use even 10 at a time, and I can put them in an organizer bin on my shelf and easily find the color and style I want.<br /><br />They fit perfectly into the keystone panel, and the cables fit fine on front and back.<br /><br />Pretty much, like a lot of passive networking, they just do what they're supposed to, and I can't say a whole lot more.

209219,5,"A Vibrant, High Quality Portable Display","This is an incredibly well made portable monitor that not only looks great, but is extremely durable and easy to use while remaining in a small, thin compact design. The display itself comes with a USB-C charging cable, wall adapter, HDMI to mini HDMI cable, and other accessories to get you up and running in no time. The monitor also comes with a removable magnetic front cover/stand if you decide you don't want it on. The monitor only needs your input (can be the HDMI input or a Thunderbolt input on the secondary USB-C port) and a USB connection to use for power.<br /><br />When powered on, the screen has an all in one control switch/toggle on the left side for your volume, brightness, saturation, and other picture/input controls. I did make a couple small adjustments before taking my photos of the display, such as disabling HDR on my PS5 (HDR works on this monitor, but I prefer having a brighter display over the dimmer but higher picture quality of HDR) and turning up the brightness. Other than those two settings, everything is at the default levels. For the test, I also set my PS5 to 1440p resolution (which the PS5 now finally supports for those that are unaware) and I had no issues with the display at all. All the games I tested looked incredible, and I also had zero input lag in any of the games and the controls were smooth and responsive. The viewing angles are also excellent. Whether viewing it from the sides, top or bottom, the picture remains as vibrant and detailed as when looking straight on. The screen also has a matte finish which helps to block out glares from windows and lights that may be around you. However, the speakers could be better. The speakers are about as good as most laptop speakers and are easily usable. Like, the sound quality of the speakers are actually really good, but my issue is that even on max volume they are a little bit too quiet for my tastes.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is an excellent, high quality portable display for whatever your needs may be. Since it not only supports mini HDMI, but Thunderbolt as well, you can connect almost any device you may need/want to this and it will work without issues.

710810,5,These are such brilliant PCs!,"I already have an older model Beelink GK55 but I needed more PCs for my home office Siemens PLC lab.  I decided to go for the extra horsepower of this 12th Gen Intel CPU and with it on sale, I couldn't come close to building a custom machine for the same money.  The CPU, alone, makes up 3/4 of the pice.  Add to that the excellent 500GB Crucial M.2 NVME drive, 16GB Crucial RAM, and Thunderbolt support via the USB-C interface and you have a lot of machine for the money.<br /><br />On two different model Beelinks I'm running identical software setups.  Siemens WinCC Professional Runtime v15.1 UPD5 (works great in Windows 11 BTW), Cogent Datahub, WITS Level 0 Server, SQL 14, a proprietary fluid hydraulics modeling software, proprietary data logging software, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Power Automate, and SimpleHelp (remote access).  All of this is running at the same time, including the remote control software.  On the older Beelink GK55 I see CPU utilization of up to 85-100%.  It handles it fine without any problems but on this newer Beelink SEi12 PC, my CPU utilization is only 4-12%.  AMAZING how much more power this newer Beelink has with the 12th Gen i5 CPU.<br />I am very pleased with the new design:<br />Metal PC Case - the older GK55 is good quality plastic<br />Good variety of interfaces for USB, LAN, and HDMI Out<br />Wifi radio is strong<br />Disk and RAM speed is excellent<br />CPU power is unreal for such a low watt machine<br />Fan noise level is great even under periods of heavy load.  I can hear it spool up but no more than the 27"" 5K iMac sitting 2 feet away from it.<br /><br />If you need a great computer for not a lot of money and you're not planning on doing AAA-title gaming, this is an outstanding value proposition.  If you're like me and need a lot of computers in a lab-type scenario, this is an incredibly good option.

417938,5,Great Device - NEEDS A POWER SOURCE!,"If I have anything negative to say about this product is that it is very disappointing that it does not come with any type of power source! There's not a DC power cable, no USB power cable, or no battery! The manufacturer expects you to be equipped with an NP-F or E6 battery! (I am a Nikon user, these batteries do not exist in my world.) In lieu of not having one of these batteries, they do not even supply a power cable. So, in order to even begin using it I had to purchase a pair of NP-F batteries along with a compatible charger.<br /><br />That being said, it does not take away from the quality of this product. If you're like me, you love your DSLR, but it is hard to be applicable in some situations because the viewfinder does not articulate, so sometimes it is hard to get the shots that you want because you cannot see what the image will end up looking like. This field monitor breaks that barrier.<br /><br />The amount of image data this field monitor provides is amazing. You can apply live filters (through LUT), get histograms, view waveforms, color information, sound information, and a multitude of important recording and image data.<br /><br />The screen is super bright. You can see this clearly in the daylight and the finish of the screen mitigates glare fairly well. The touch screen is sensitive in a good way, too. You do not need to pound on the screen to get it to pick up your touches.<br /><br />The standard tripod mount makes it applicable to most camera rigs or tripods, so it is easy to mount and place it where your need it most.<br /><br />Watch your battery power, though. At full brightness it can eat through the batteries rather quick. If you have the option for DC power, that will honestly carry you the furthest!<br /><br />If you need something to help you view your shots while you're on the move or help you get the angles you wouldn't be able to achieve with the viewfinder your camera is equipped with, this field viewer is certainly a great way to go. I enjoy using it as a personal monitor for a self-facing DSLR setup so I do not need to monitor it on my computer screen. The quality is great and it helps get the best shot angle every time.",[],B0B65JF2FB,B0C2HFPVD6,AGTR4M4RT6VATS3OSIMLBQ3WFLVA,2023-02-10 18:15:09.265,0,False,498

It is what is connecting my router to the LAN side. The zyxel switch reports it connected at 2.5gig. I have not tested performance though.<br /><br />I did not see the increase in performance from workstation to workstation I had hoped for but did see 2x to 2.5x speeds from the Cisco 1gig switches I had been using. went from 60-90  MB/s to 200 MB/s. I did not change out to better cables so maybe seeing some performance issues there.<br /><br />I have a Asustor NAS using a USB 3.1 2.5gig Ethernet adapter connected one of the USB 3.0 ports on it to one of the 2.5 gig ports on one of the the zyxel switches and though it runs a little faster than on the  1gig network its not much more. I am getting maybe 80 to 90 MB/s instead of 50 to 60 MB/s on average. I had been using a LAG with 4 1gig Ethernet ports on NAS to Cisco switch and this seems a bit faster overall.

321276,4,Almost the exact laptop stand I was searching for,"A versatile adjustable laptop stand with a carrying sleeve, but with two design flaws. Yet, I still like it. I've been looking for a laptop stand for a while that would work something like this one. It is well-made of Aluminum and has a quality feel. I wanted a stand like this, one that is mostly an open design, light weight and adjustable. You can see from the picture I also wanted something that could be solidly placed on a turntable that is part of my custom-designed laptop stand. However, I did run into what I consider to be 2 design flaws depicted by the arrows in the picture. The arrows are also pointing to my temporary fixes. Flaw #1: the two adjustable legs move separately. Flaw #2: the adjustable legs have a small metal tab that fits into the adjustment holes in the bottom rails. This is where the problems arise. If you lift the upper rails where the lap top rests to adjust the height the legs immediately come out of the holes. Then, if you try to adjust the height while holding one of the upper rails you cannot set both legs at the same time. And if you try this with laptop on the stand it's even more difficult. Two design changes that would help would be to have a horizontal scissor brace to connect the two adjustable legs which would allow them to move together so that they could be placed at the same time, and to have a better foot mechanism for the adjustable legs to stay in place in the adjustment holes should you need to pick up the stand while maintaining the angle setting.<br /><br />The challenge to updating the design is that the stand collapses and expands, allowing to set an adjustable width as well as height, but that flexibility eliminates using a fixed width horizontal brace for the legs. The arrows in my picture are pointing to my two temporary fixes. I put a small piece of Velcro on each adjustable leg and cut out a piece of hard cardboard with Velcro on the back. If I need to move or readjust the stand, I support the legs horizontally using the Velcro stick, and once set, the tape keeps the legs in place should the stand need to be moved.<br /><br />So sorry for the lengthy and maybe boring review. In the meantime, I am giving the stand a 4-star review considering that most people will only be setting the stand once and it will remain in place without moving or adjusting.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716R33qwYAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716R33qwYAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716R33qwYAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B619CHTQ,B0B619CHTQ,AF54WHRNK5TS2Y66MFMEXRDXXXUA,2023-03-04 02:13:36.517,0,False,498

The pads sit right in front of your ears, around the jawbone.

I do tend to top off the battery by sticking it on the charger in the precious few minutes that I may have between meetings.

If you still hear sound at roughly the same or louder volume you have bone conduction headphones.<br /><br />Set your expectations if you intend to use them for music. Bone conduction headphones sound horrible. Doesn't matter the brand or model, they all sound bad. The model of shokz I have were praised for excellent sound quality.

727702,2,Good concept but execution does not work for me,"This product appealed to me mainly because of its solar charging feature and a discounted price at the time of my purchase. Other interesting features: FM radio (with a rectractable pull-up antenna) and a LED flashlight. Upon receipt of the product the first impression is that build and materials fall short of expectations, even compared to ""value"" brands. Ultimately, the combination does not meet my needs.<br /><br />The battery life is rated from 3 to 6 hours (volume level not specified), per the product's packaging. That's not long enough for my outdoor activities (no way to charge) but might work if you are closer to a power source (other than the sun, of course!) to get a good charge. It's unknown how efficiently the two solar panels (one on the back of the speaker and another one on top) will keep the 1200mAh battery going while powering the speakers (per the product's packaging, output power is rated at 5W and the ""working voltage"" is DC 5V solar charging,) The top solar panel would be partially obstructed if one puts the phone on top of the built-in holder (at an angle, horizontally).<br /><br />The sound is clear but on the tinny side, not much in the way of bass. It would work well for white noise, news reports, jazz, folk or more vocal-forward music. For most everything else, I was left wanting more sonically. Looking through the speaker grille, there appear to be two openings, purportedly for a (larger) driver and a (smaller) tweeter, respectively,<br /><br />The quality of material is a weak point, but it is lightweight. I had intended to use this for outdoor recreational or light work duty, but I do not think it will stand well to my use. Fair enough, there is no IPX rating claimed, but I am not confident it will wear well with my intended use.<br /><br />If the price is right, it can be a good option if a fuller-range sound quality or build quality are prime considerations. I can see this being of value in a garage or for light yard duty outdoors to take advantage of the solar charging features. For more rugged outdoor activities of longer duration (picnic, hiking, beach), consider alternatives to compare the build quality and expected battery life to meet your needs/expectations.",[],B0BN5TRQPG,B0BN5TRQPG,AEA5LWYQIAMIJ25RVQBMCD6NQ2OQ,2023-04-01 19:03:28.878,0,False,497

I have already confirmed no change in temps for my GPU.<br />*Bridge cable appears to be decent quality and is also flexible enough to move around a little.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*If you have a current gen GPU (RTX 4000 series in particular) you are definitely going to lose the rear fan slot - look at my pic (thats an MSI gaming trio RTX 4070ti).  The rear fan doesn't even come close to fitting with my GPU.  I could install the fan on the outside of the case, that is actually an option and there is a slot to get the fan wires back through into the case, but I'm not sure yet if I want to do that or how it would look.<br />*One of the tabs on the left side of the mount (that interlocks with the case) is located where the mobo I/O shield is.  This shouldn't be there because it actually interferes with installation.  I had to flatten it out with pliers to get it to install correctly.  I guess it would install right if you put this mount in BEFORE your motherboard install, but otherwise it doesn't.<br />*Its expensive for what it is.  There are a lot of whole cases that don't cost this much.  But if you have a O11 mini and you like the look, its worth having the one that is made specifically for this case.<br /><br />NOTE: Depending on your GPU you may have to loosen the little screws holding the PCIe port down to the bottom plate, mine was too far back and the GPU wouldn't mount up properly.

189359,5,A little hard to understand and set up but it works,"I bought this because I wanted to have a backup to my skeevy Spectrum internet, which is fast, but goes down far too often.  I have a Verizon home LTE device, and an EERO mesh network 6E that all my devices connect to.  I wanted it to cut over to the LTE when cable goes down, very quickly and seamlessly, and be able to do the full speed of hte cable internet (which is why I didn't by the Balance 20, which while supposedly easier, only gets 150 gbps).  So I bought this 20x balance device.  I'm no networking expert, but I know enough to be dangerous.  Took me about three or four hours to get it set up, now it's working.  Have tested by unplugging the cable modem and it cut over to the Verizon internet within a few seconds.  Excellent.  Why 3 or 4 hours?  Realizing that the Verizon device was the same IP address as the Peplink device, making everything kind of hitchy,  took about a half hour to figure out how to solve and do...solution was to change the IP address on the Peplink. Fairly easy to do but was difficult to find out how.  Updating firmware, and getting proper license (the VLAN requires an included one year subscription, which is a little tricky to figure out) and registration carried in took another half hour  or so.  Fairly easy to do but was difficult to find out how.  Spent the rest of the time getting the Vlan (where you can use a LAN plug on the device as a WAN plug in order to plug in the Verizon device).  Not super intuitive, and the instructions are a little difficult to follow, but I finally got there.  And it works like I said, well, and make sense now.  But this is clearly not a standard consumer device you'd give your mom or grandma or let your wife touch....you need to be persistent and/or know what you're doing (I'm very persistent with minimal knowledge of what I'm doing like I said).

901768,5,One of the best cases for the price. Comparable to the Logitech Combo Touch,"This case is really great, especially for the price. I own the Logitech Combo Touch, but wanted a second case for my bf’s iPad without having to spend the same dough. This case is about 80% as good and way better than most of the cheap keyboard cases on the market.<br /><br />The touchpad is about 30% smaller than the one on the combo touch and not as responsive which is the biggest difference between the two. The other big difference between this one and the LCT is that the connection is Bluetooth vs. Physical between the keyboard and the case portion. There isn’t any notable lag when using it, but there is a lag sometimes when connecting. The keyboard also separates from the case a little easier so the case can come apart in your bag. The other noticeable  difference is this one has multiple colors for the backlight whereas the combo touch is only a white light. I also like that this one has a pencil holder which won’t charge the pencil, but keeps it supremely safe inside your bag and won’t fall off like it often does with the LCT.<br /><br />The similarities are a lot more between this one and the LCT. They both flip open to any angle and the kickstand can also be used to elevate the ipad when it is disconnected from the keyboard for a comfortable writing angle as long as you don’t put too much weight onto it. They are nearly the same size. The keyboards are nice, but this one has a little more travel to the keys which is neither positive nor negative to me, just different and maybe slightly louder than the LCT. The case part feels a little cheaper and is a naked plastic vs a rubber material. This one is slightly heavier and thicker because it carries a battery on board vs. being powered by the ipad, but it is hardly noticeable when the heavy ipad is loaded into it. I can’t comment on the actual battery life of this case yet because I tend to give it some juice at the same time I charge the ipad.<br /><br />If money is no object I think the LCT is narrowly better just because of the quality of the materials, better trackpad and the physical connection, but this one is darn close and unless you just like having the best name brand things this will more than do the trick and protect your ipad.",[],B0BKL2F5YV,B0BXN4MWFR,AGHLTZBT5DJF5YESCUMGCFTT3ASQ,2023-01-01 05:13:44.874,0,False,497
264394,5,Excellent value!,"A couple of months ago I bought a new(er) car - a Lincoln MKZ.  I love the car.  But I quickly realized that it has several blind spots such that I always felt uncomfortable changing lanes.  The car has built-in blind spot and cross traffic monitors but I consider them to be more of a safety hazard than a safety feature because 90% of the (somewhat obnoious loud) warnings are false alarms.<br /><br />I decided to try adding an always on back-up camera.<br /><br />The first camera I bought was a 4.3 inch model.  I quickly realized that the 4.3 inch monitor was too small to see clearly.  So i returned it and ordered an Amtifo W70 7 inch model.  the Amtifo W70 has a large crystal clear picture so it was just what I was looking for.  I liked it so well that I also installed an Amtifo front camera.  Now I can view the front, the rear, or a split screen.  Excellent.<br /><br />While it is very simple to install and use, the one drawback of the W70 is that the controls are on the back of the monitor.  That isn't really a problem because I don't change views often and once you you know where the buttons are you can easily reach them from the front.<br /><br />I like the W70 so well for the Lincoln that I decided to try the A19 model for my F150 pickup.  The A19 is very similar to the W70 except that it is much more customizable and all of the controls are on the front.  And it has a different monitor bracket which can be installed on flat surfaces such as the dash.<br /><br />This is the best back-up camera kit I have seen!  If have have any issue with this model it is only that I prefer the much smaller, simpler windshield monitor bracket of the W70 model.  This bracket seems better suited to an RV, motor home, or bus.  And you can't simply switch to the smaller bracket because of the way it attaches to the back of the monitor.  But in any case, I would say both models are an excellent value.

On that night stand I have several items that require cords.  2 of which are an echo 15 and my 10 foot iPhone charger cord.  I absolutely love the ability to wind and unwind, very easy as much cord as I need so I can move my nightstand wherever I want and not have the cords everywhere.  I also love the fact that wherever the cord ends there are plenty of places for the charging part to be held.  I love that the cord is hidden Under what looks like a flower basically… and actually that knob in the middle came and useful.  My echo 15… Where I needed my nightstand moved. It happened to end right at a spot where I had the extender connected, but I was able to wrap it around the knob and it held in place just fine.  In my picture you will see that honestly there is too much cord wrapped around that winder.  Some things that you want to consider before purchasing:  the thickness of the cord you will be needing to wind up and the amount of cord. Example:  it could not wrap up 7 feet of my iPhone charger. Technically it could but it was really too much cord (quite obvious as it did not want to stay wrapped, and I had to try to really tighten it ) and I think that’s what made it end up popping off entirely.  The good news is I found out that the adhesive does not leave any marks. It did not even leave the area with any residual sticky mess. I’m really disappointed that they do not make a bigger size because honestly these do not hold that much cord. I cannot give a review how well they do sidemounted as all of mine have been mounted on top of my nightstand. I am going to try to use some command Velcro.  I do not think that the adhesive is going to hold up in general.  Also… Shipping took forever.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lXpjywwuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lXpjywwuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lXpjywwuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zkNu3P3HL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zkNu3P3HL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zkNu3P3HL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09XX8R6Y7,B09XWJHV7P,AGTSXOMEBQ37VUHHC7AKEIM5BPHQ,2023-01-19 00:29:01.551,0,True,497
162600,4,Every bit as good as a genuine Dell battery.,"After a month or so of basic use, I’m noticing between 5-7 hours of battery life. And for the price, it’s a great replacement option instead of the OEM Dell battery that will cost in some cases three times as much. Naturally, battery life will vary depending on your Windows settings but for most users, you’ll be utilizing the so-called “balanced” setting in Windows battery settings. Anything else will just kill it off as any other brand used.<br /><br />The battery comes with a standard one-year warranty and you are provided with the tools to install the battery. The particular laptop this battery is for is really easy to install. Three screws and a battery cable and you’re done. Be advised the battery does “NOT” ship with a battery cable you will have to re-use the original one.<br /><br />As a Dell-certified technician myself I have experience with this particular model of laptop (a Latitude 7480 in this case and many 7490s) I have seen many many of these batteries inflate due to sitting on charging docks on a daily basis and not being discharged on a regular basis. I don’t think it's a Dell thing, just this design of the battery itself. I’ve seen Dell OEM batteries replaced a year later start inflating due to being on a dock charging all the time so be sure not to do this. Discharge it from time to time and use the laptop on the battery, I’m telling you right now again…..discharge from time to time, I cannot stress it enough.<br /><br />Luckily for me, the battery I was replacing had not inflated it just lost most of its charge capacity from being an original for 5-6 years. The bottom line is this battery performs every bit as well as an OEM manufacturer brand and I advise you to look at it as a worthy contender replacement. My experience with it has been great. And to prolong life I advise not using a USB-C charger (since the 7480 laptops have a USB-C port) of more than 65 watts.<br /><br />In my pictures, you will see the original battery in the laptop, the new one in the box, and the new one freshly installed. This will likely be my go-to source for replacements in the future should I need one","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iZ0lRVKvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iZ0lRVKvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iZ0lRVKvL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8128w7-Vk3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8128w7-Vk3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8128w7-Vk3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81mRHFkRwWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81mRHFkRwWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81mRHFkRwWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09Y2SZMWW,B09J8NSJ36,AHWDVKKK22V6EPA3L7UTZWNCJ5YQ,2023-01-30 14:50:45.013,0,False,497
100494,2,Used 248 calendar days,"Hello, here's my review after 248 calendar days.<br /><br />I bought two of these keyboards, both were Perixx PERIBOARD-329.  After 8 months 3 days I think I have enough information to accurately give an honest review.<br />Lets start with the lighted background.  All colors still working.  FYI --my system is in my home office and stays turned on 24/7 with (no sleep mode) or unless there's a power outage. (There has been no power outages to report).<br /><br />Reminder:<br />Dim effect still works accurately.  Dim/Bright is done by holding down FN and Page Pg down for dim  and  Pg up for brighter.<br /><br />Keystrokes:<br />Sounds good, they are not silent but not loud.  just perfect for me and comfortable.  They have white scissor action. (Love it) not annoying at all. Best key sound on the market in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall daily use:<br />I use my computer in my home office and I'm online about 16hrs a day.  The letters are starting to fade out on the keys.  I tried to fix one but as soon as I popped the key off, it would not go back into place, no matter what I tried. A total waste of time after 10 mins trying to reset the key.<br />I love this keyboard, it's perfect but the fading of letters bothers me and being in a professional position and have people come and go. Fading letters on a keyboard does not impress people. I tried with a sharpie-Marker extra fine point, but it didn't last long maybe a couple months at best.<br /><br />Final Notes:<br />It maybe I have an acidic skin oil in my system because I will admit the same issue occurred on a Logitech board also which cost me $139. They would not replace the keys.  NOTE: I never asked this vendor to fix my  Perixx PERIBOARD-329.  I just simply toss the keybaord in the trash this morning and dug this new one out of the parts closet.<br />This is my review after using the  Perixx PERIBOARD-329 after using it for 8 months 3 days.",[],B07GPRJ97X,B07GPRJ97X,AFEVUNJOFT2YI5YGC3MGYZYBERYA,2023-01-28 14:29:10.542,0,False,497
331752,2,"This keyboard showed great potential, but has an irritating flaw.","I got the Virfour Bluetooth Keyboard to update and replace the wired keyboard I currently use with my Mac Mini.<br /><br />The aluminum Virfour appears to be well built and durable.  I like its style and satin aluminum finish that matches well with my computer and monitor.  The keyboard easily paired with my computer in just seconds in three ways: Via a 2.4G dongle and by either of two Bluetooth channels available on the keyboard. I’m not sure why two Bluetooth channels are included.  Either one worked seamlessly with my computer and both seem to do the exact same job in the exact same way.<br /><br />The keyboard is comfortable to use, but I wish it had a way to tilt the keyboard up in the back just a bit.  One feature that may appeal to some is the ability to illuminate the keys in seven different colors, each at three levels of brightness.  I thought it was an interesting feature, but didn’t anticipate using it much.  However, when I showed this feature to my roommate,  she went nuts over it, stating it helped her see the keys “so much better.”<br /><br />To conserve the rechargeable battery, the keyboard turns off when not in use after just a few seconds, but instantly returns to life at the first press of a key.  In fact, I charged it to 100% four days ago and, using it moderately, it is still showing to be at 100% capacity.  Although the keyboard is rechargeable via a type C USB port, unfortunately when the non-replaceable battery wears out, as all rechargeable batteries do, the keyboard will become useless.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for some unfathomable reason, the keyboard will spontaneously start typing in all uppercase letters.  Furthermore, when that happens, it refuses to allow the cursor to be moved or select text for cutting and pasting.  The issue is resolved by turning the keyboard off and then on again, but it happens too frequently to warrant its continued use.  Given the sleek style, extended battery life and wireless technology, I really wish this keyboard worked well. By that I mean flawlessly and, unfortunately, it does not.  Full disclosure:  I did not evaluate this keyboard on a Windows based computer and the above stated problem may, or may not, occur with that operating system.",[],B0BRKKTGS6,B0C6JQCS9G,AGMOFG3VTLV5QEK3K3VW62DHKSRA,2023-03-23 14:58:58.482,0,False,497
503514,2,Works as a privacy screen; no noticeable effect on glare; weak adhesives; poor value,"Item: Computer Privacy Screen Filter 24 inch,Removable 16:9 Widescreen<br /><br />Price (at time of review *): $40.99<br />(* Note that I receive some items at discounted or zero cost through Amazon Vine participation.  The price indicated is the purchase price, with or without discounts, as advertised on the product page at the time this review is posted)<br /><br />Pros: When affixed, the screen is only viewable to those sitting immediately in front of the monitor, so the privacy screen feature is effective enough if you are only trying to shield what you are viewing from those trying to view your screen from the side<br /><br />Cons:  I ordered this item specifically for the advertised anti-glare/blue light protection and I am not seeing any noticeable effect after several days of use.  While I have not done any technical tests to determine the extent to which the screen filters out blue light/glare, I have not noticed any change in the soreness of my eyes or mild headaches resulting from extended screen time and the glare does not appear to have decreased considerably.  While advertised as being protective in the listing, the packaging indicated this was a privacy filter only and there was no reference to eye protection.  The adhesives are very poor.  They are difficult to remove from the backing, particularly after you take the double sided tape off the sheet it is attached to, at which point the other side of the adhesive requires a great deal of effort to try and remove, which can wrinkle the adhesive itself and make it less effective.  Once it is affixed, it does not stay attached easily and I needed to use small pieces of electrical tape to secure.  Given the only noticeable effect of this screen is to prevent people from off to the side from viewing my work, which was not an issue to begin with, it was a very disappointing order given difficulties affixing properly and limited eye protection.<br /><br />Ratings (1-10 scale; 0 = Very poor, 5 = Average, 10 = Exceptional)<br />Quality: 3<br />Value (based on purchase price of $40.99): 1.5<br />Utility: 3<br />Overall: 2.5<br /><br />Hopefully you found this review helpful in identifying the best product to meet your needs.",[],B0BNHMGLK4,B0BVB7M81W,AE52ABQUAFW5XQ6A5N7IHOV6IBBQ,2023-02-07 20:53:55.029,0,False,497
756932,4,The best I’ve found for sleeping,"Music helps me sleep but my wife likes it quiet. This is the perfect solution. I originally purchased the adjustable but it didn’t adjust as much as I expected and it dug into the back of my neck, so for me the standard is much better.<br /><br />Here are my pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Battery life<br />This will get you through every hour of the night and you won’t have to worry about it dying or a voice saying “battery low” as I’ve had with other headphones.<br /><br />-Comfort<br />It seems tight at first but once it’s adjusted you can barely feel it and can sleep any way you like and will not get in the way or cause discomfort.<br /><br />-Durability<br />The band can stretch a great distance and will not break. This is great for conforming to all head types.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Battery hardness<br />The control battery on the front is tight against the skin and was leaving a red mark on my forehead in the morning, but I’ve since put a couple folded up tissues in between and it feels much better. I believe some fur on the back or some kind of cushion would be a great solution for this issue.<br /><br />-Width/Height<br />The width is great for the ears, but I feel it’s too high on the forehead. I believe it would benefit by being slimmer in the front so that it does not cover so much of the head. I ended up folding the bottom a bit so that it fits normally across my forehead.<br /><br />-Ambient noise<br />The sound is a little low and does not drown out much noise around you. If your partner snores, you may hear it. Sometimes I put on noise canceling headphones over top of these when first falling asleep and that helps block out any noise. If the max volume was louder or if the ear buds could somehow grip over the ear, it could be an improvement.<br /><br />Overall it is a great product and has beaten every other pair of headphones I’ve used for sleeping. It is the best but would be even better with the adjustments mentioned above.",[],B0B4JC5TFC,B094ZNRZMD,AG2MGXHOTV5EHD3FXXK35JUNWQKQ,2023-03-04 16:26:35.546,9,True,497
257101,4,"Pretty nice, a couple minor things..","[[VIDEOID:466bf8494d8c0aa7e4d51dd2ba2419d4]] I got this for my son to use in his room, he needed a new portable speaker as well as a wireless charger and this does both, so it seemed like a good fit. So let’s break down the functions-<br />1) portable speaker- easy to connect, sound is deep and rich. Not quite “Bose” level quality but pretty close.<br />2) wireless charger- it does wirelessly charge, but it has to be plugged in for that function to work. Which is a negative thing. I wish it worked whether plugged in or not. It defeats the purpose of being portable if only some of the functions work when it is unplugged.<br />3) touch lamp- the handle is also a touch lamp, it has different levels of brightness to suit your needs. Works great.<br />4) phone holder- the handle can be posed at any position to prop your phone up for you. I don’t think we will use this function a lot but it does work. If your phone/case is very heavy it might not work unless the handle is all the way up, as the tension on the handle is not super high-it lifts up and down pretty easily.<br /><br />Overall this is a nice item. It looks sleek and modern, and my son likes it. He will use it daily to charge his phone as his charging port doesn’t work that well, and he will use it to play music a lot while he plays video games. He will also probably use the lamp part as well. Is it worth the price tag? I don’t know. It seems a bit steep for what it is, but if it’s something you will use for its multiple functions then it will be worth it. It also makes an odd, loud sound/tube when being powered on and off. And you can’t turn it up or down. No matter what you have the volume on, the on and off tunes are super loud. Which kind of takes away from the sleek/modern aspect of it. That, and the fact that it doesn’t charge your phone unless it’s plugged in, is the reason for deducting a star. I would still recommend this item however.",[],B0BG3WY7FL,B0BG6H5FND,AEM6W3ILBY2U4WLIT5AOKS53I53A,2023-03-03 23:13:56.411,0,False,497
565981,5,Excellent Subwoofer Amplifier! 5 Stars!,"I purchased this Soundavo PSB-1000DSP Class D subwoofer amplifier to power 2 old NHT SW3S subwoofers. The NHT SW3S subs were<br />6 OHM subs and originally powered by NHT<br />SA-3 250W Class G monaural amplifiers. One of the SA-3 amps died and no longer powers on. It was not a blown fuse situation. Rather than attempt to find a repair company to fix the 20 plus year old amp, I decided to purchase a new subwoofer amp which would also work with a 12V trigger. No 12V trigger on the old NHT SA-3 subwoofer amps. I was interested in the Soundavo PSB1000DSP because of the power-<br />1000W at 8 OHM, Class D and that it could power 2 subwoofers. I read the literature on the PSB1000DSP and was only concerned that the manufacturer cautioned that if you were hooping up 2 subwoofers that the nominal impedance of the 2 subs should not be less than 8 OHMS. My old NHT subs were 6 OHM and rated at 250W. I decided to take the plunge and purchase. I am glad that I made the purchase. The Soundavo PSB1000DSP has no trouble driving my 2 old NHT SW3S subwoofers. The new amp does not even get hot. There has been absolutely no overheating of the new amp driving my NHT SW3S subwoofers even after watching the movie, Top Gun Maverick. I run the 2 NHT SW3S subwoofers at 3/4 volume with the Soundavo PSB1000DSP. This new subwoofer amplifier is modern and powerful. All crossover, bass adjustments, etc. are made using the small remote. No more analog controls to adjust on the back of the old subwoofer amp. This is a modern digital subwoofer amplifier. Build quality is great. I now can utilize a 12V trigger. One PSB1000DSP now powers my 2 passive NHT SW3S subwoofers. Finally, the price. I bought it on Amazon from Soundavo with a $150 discount. I paid $600 for this new subwoofer amplifier.

210795,2,Work Headset is difficult/hard to switch from computer to phone.,"The shape and headset ear cushions are good, they are a little tight for my big round head. So after using it for a few days, by lunch time my ears hurt. The battery is good and seems to last a while. It would manage 12 ton14 hour talk time.<br />I often walk away from my computer/office and take phone calls on my phone using the headset and then walk back to my office for another Teams meeting. The two detractors that are going to make me return this item are:<br />1. I have found, when I walk away from the computer and I am streaming a podcast from my cell phone, the headsets start to beep every 10 seconds. It stops when I am back near the computer and the USB dongle has a clear connection again. This means, anytime I walk away from my laptop to make a sandwich or walk outside, wanting to take the headset, it beeps. That's not what I am looking for. I wanted a seamless switch from computer dongle or to my paired connected phone with no need to stay near the USB dongle to the headset.<br />2. The headset does switch between the computer and then to my phone somewhat seamlessley sometime, when the comouter is nearby. Even after listening to podcasts during lunch, and my computer is nearby but is off, the headset doesn't easily keep olaying the podcast/stay connected to my phone via Bluetooth, despite the headset being paired and connected to the phone. It wasn't playing the podcast anymore. The functionality is there, but the programming/software is not as seamless as I am used to from say a bluetooth ear buds or a Jabra evolve headset. To get the sound coming from the phone to start playing through the headset, I have to then power cycle the headset for it to reconnect again to my cell phone playing the podcast. These are unnecessary steps and I'm looking for better bluetooth 2 source switching by a headset between android and laptop.<br />I will be returning this headset once another candidate is found. I spent 3 years using the Jabra Evolve 75 for nearly 8hrs a day, everyday, and the mic recently failed. This is me starting to find an off brand replacement that doesn't have a 275 price tag.

243990,1,Not senior friendly,"Here is the review I left for the LG TV that came with the Magic Remote. I have described the issue I have with that remote:<br /><br />We purchased this LG 65"" Class - OLED C2 Series - 4K UHD OLED TV in February so this is an initial review. Hopefully we will not have issues with the tv in the future. So far so good. The tv is great, with one caveat which I will describe below in detail. We replaced a 55"" Panasonic Plasma tv that was virtually indestructible. But we wanted a bigger screen and a tv capable of displaying 4k content The bottom line is the LG picture is far superior to the Panasonic Plasma even with DirecTv regular broadcasts. The truth is there isn't a lot of available 4k content unless you want to pay more for each individual program or movie. The same is true for Netflix and Amazon Prime and none of that has anything to do with the LG tv. We would purchase it again in a heartbeat. The caveat is the horrible LG ""Magic Remote"" that came with it. The ""magic"" part is the pointer icon it puts on the screen to select programs and other functions. The pointer is so sensitive it’s almost impossible to use. You can go into the menus and change the sensitivity to ""Slow"" but that doesn't help much. We had so much trouble with the pointer we had to  call LG technical support and have them remotely change the setting. Even after slowing the sensitivity, when we moved the pointer icon over whatever we wanted to watch, simply pressing the select button was enough pressure on the remote to cause the pointer to move off the selected item. Did anyone at LG over the age of 50 even attempt to use this remote? Is this a reason to give the LG tv a bad review? No and here's why: The wonderful LG tech in India had already heard plenty of these complaints. She recommended going online and purchasing an LG AKB75095307 remote. Bingo! $9.00 online from Walmart. Received it in the mail in 2 days, added 2 AAA batteries and problem solved! No evil magic pointer, just a tv and remote that work perfectly. You can be confident in buying this tv. Just order an LG AKB75095307 remote ahead of time. Then you'll have a remote for the adults in the house and the kids can use the ""Magic"" remote.",[],B0992TJFM3,B0992TJFM3,AGRUU5VRIUUESDHXCWMA2CPNJTLQ,2023-03-11 17:50:24.923,0,False,497
683992,5,"Good little amp for what it is.  Know what you are buying, and if it fits your needs.","This little amp works great for what it is.  Knowing what it is is the key to beign hapy with it.<br /><br />Like most lower-end audio equipment, the listed power rattings are ""Max"" vs. RMS.  This is the maximum output the amp can generate, not the measure of useable power delivered to the speakers.  If I had to guess, I'm working with maybe 10-15 good watts here, which is plenty for the small bookshelf speakers I'm driving.  The passive sub output is good as well; I didn't figure it would generate enough umph to drive an 8"" passive sub, but it's doing just fine.<br /><br />The sound quality is good; its not great.  Not a lot of depth, but some of that is due to using small speakers.  The low end of the frequency range is minimal.  You will need a small sub to complement the smaller speakers that can be driven by this amp.  Highs are represented well, mids are a little muddy. Adding a sub is a must as you won't be able to drive even larger bookshelf speakers.  The passive sub support is surprisingly solid. There is no noticeable standing hum or static even at maximum volume which surprised me.<br /><br />I plan to use this setup in my garage to extend the audio range of a TV and for streaming music from my phone; it's perfect for this application.  If your intent is to drive large, power hungry, speakers in a sound centric installation then you'll be disapointed.  If you are looking for audiophile quality sound form this amp, you'll be disappointed again.  I'm using an old set of cheap Kenwood surround speakers with 4"" drivers and a passive 8"" sub.  It drives them all and sounds surprisingly good.<br /><br />The bluetooth support is solid and connects flawlesly and fast.  The control pots seem to be nice quality although no detents are present.  The speaker connections are of fair quality.  They include both banana plug support and screw down nuts.  The Aux inputs and Sub pre out (for a powered sub) are standard RCA.<br />All said, nice little rig for what it is.

So, to answer a few concerns I read about battery life and weather.....let me attempt to give a thorough description for comparison.<br />We moved full time from So. Fla. to what used to be our vaca. home in western NC. Located about 2000 above sea level, in a mountain rain forest, and cold. Days of 0-2 degrees cold with plenty of rain. That is not smoke in the Smoky Mountains, but moisture. This is a fairly wet climate.<br />We only leave the cameras on 24/7 when out of town, or at night after dark. The traffic on our dead end road averages about 3-4 vehicles a day, and 0-1 after dark. Not much motion on our street other than postal, and a couple of us coming and going. We did leave for a week over Thanksgiving, but other than that our usage is as described.<br />Since installation, with indirect rain and very cold weather, here is the update. Both cameras have worked fine without a glitch. The first camera installed in Nov., and left running over Thanksgiving week, still shows 60% battery life. The second camera 80%.<br />The two wired cameras I have in the screened in porch areas also have worked perfectly........they are indoors but the rooms receive no heat.<br />Honestly, even though we have nowhere near the crime up here that we experienced in So. Fla., I would buy a couple more cameras for the garage and back yard. Unfortunately, even though we have gig speed internet, our provider does not offer a router with the same oomph as the top model Xfinity provides. And I do not like messing around with repeaters. But for what we have, and what we need, these four cameras work just fine. They are paired with two Alexas, a 5 inch and an 8 inch, which also become remote cameras when you leave the house.<br />I would suggest purchasing the Ring Protect plan as well. We only bought the mid tier plan since I do not want to set up the complete monitoring system. The mid tier account holds video, gives you 10% off on new equipment, and, unless I am mistaken, extends the warranty for as long as you subscribe. Hope this helps.",[],B07Q6ZZFLS,B08QSB7SR3,AHUQZKK5RBVPP4W3YN2IIOGOTQ4A,2023-02-05 14:23:47.349,13,True,497
145734,4,Good low-profile mount,"This mount is nice and thin, making TV very close to wall.  The mount itself is fairly sturdy. The lack of<br />a center support between the upper and lower portion of the mount, as is present on competitors products, leaves room for a recessed outlet box if you need to place one in the middle of the mount.  I did not notice any sagging after mounting TV and Sanus’s weight ratings are generally conservative. The Sanus website has helpful guidance on where to mount things based on make and model or size TV which was nice and I did not need to break out my calculator. The instructions are good and all hardware was included and is of good quality. I placed some Velcro wrap material behind the mount to make dressing cables easier before tightening mount fully to wall. My TV is not flat on the back so I had to make sure the mount protruded slightly above the thickest point and on my LG 55” I had to use the 2.5mm spacers. A speed square, not included, made it easy to get the rails on the TV squared up.  You will need a drill, No. 2 Phillips screw driver, a 7/64th drill bit, small level, pencil, stud finder (or strong magnet) and a tape measure if you want to do this yourself. There is a nice printed template in the box to help with hole placement. I chose this mount because it works on wall stud distances greater than 16” on center and gives a bit more room to move TV left or right to center on wall if your studs are not exactly centered. You need to mount this in to studs or masonry wall (masonry wall anchors included and requires a hammer drill and larger drill bit to use). The TV was easy to mount by resting the top hook on the rails to the mount and then gently pressing button of TV to snap in to the bottom of mount.  The rails have screw adjustment to fine tune the level of your TV some if you did not get the rails mounted perfectly square. You will likely need a friend to help lifting the TV on to the mount and to help hold TV away from wall to connect cables as it is very low profile there is not room to reach behind TV after fully mounted. I would also recommend picking up right angle HDMI cables and digital audio cables if you want to connect to set top box, game console, and stereo.",[],B06XDS57JB,B06XDS57JB,AFCSRISQ65CBP2LCHL5JZIJXGQAA,2023-02-20 19:37:40.637,1,True,497

The wi-fi connected quickly and has stronger signal strength than the previous (MIS brand) adapter I was using.<br /><br />Likes:<br />⊛ thicc boi antennas - I've had expensive routers with smaller antennas than these chungus doohickies.<br />⊛ minipcie card is easy to remove in case future upgrades are needed.<br />⊛ low profile bracket included - Factory screws are on really tight. Don't use the included screwdriver to remove the full height bracket, you'll just strip the screw head.<br />⊛ screwdriver and case screw included - don't need it, but it's a thoughtful gesture that I appreciate.<br />⊛ driver CD included - Who even does that anymore? Nice people, that's who. Again, didn't need but still appreciate.<br />⊛ stronger signal strength than any other wi-fi adapter I've had in this location. (Probably due to dem thicc bois!)<br />⊛ lastly, but most importantly: works with Linux (Kubuntu 22.10) immediately. I wasted HOURS trying to get realtek and broadcom wifi chips to work on newer kernel, without success. As expected, the Intel chip on this wifi adapter worked immediately.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />Being super, extra, unnecessarily nitpicky; I don't like the thin metal antenna connector retention bracket for where the antenna leads connect to the wifi card itself. It's probably fine but would rather have seen plastic or non-conductive coating on a better quality metal piece. It's really no big deal, but I couldn't think of anything else to put under 'dislike'.<br /><br />Verdict: Based on the first hour of use after installing, I'd recommend this to anyone with a low profile computer and/or anyone wanting a solid Linux compatible wifi adapter. Wifi signal strength is better than expected and speed is what it should be. I can't speak to the Bluetooth yet, as I'm waiting on a header female to USB-A adapter cable to arrive.

927707,5,Good speakers,"Sometimes I don't pay enough attention when I order things. I guess 2 pair didn't register with me when I read the listing. I think all I saw was ""Bluetooth speakers."" These were really much larger than I anticipated and there were 4 of them instead of 2. I don't know if all 4 of them work, because I have only connected 2 of them as I just wanted them for an average size room and don't need nor have room for all four. I don't have an outside area in which to set these up. With that being said, the two that I have connected work great. I also had no idea what that little doohicky box was that came with them. After reading instructions I found out it was an amplifier/receiver/power supply that the speakers plugged into (again, I have GOT to start paying more attention to things I order online). I thought Bluetooth meant they did not have to be wired to anything. Nevertheless, the instructions told me exactly what to do and set up was easy (and that's coming from someone who didn't know what was going on). One end of wires hooked to speaker the other to the receiver. Just make sure to match colors. Plug the power supply to the receiver, press the MODE button until the BT light is flashing, go to your Bluetooth settings on the device you want to play find the speakers in your list of devices and connect. The name on my device did NOT come up as ""HERDIO"" as the instructions stated. I don't remember now what it did say (seems like it was some letters and numbers) because I changed it to Herdio once I found it. You can also play music on a thumb drive or any device with an aux line. Can also plug a mic into it. I think my only complaint is the annoying voice that loudly blurts out ""Bluetooth (or whichever) mode,"" ""connected"" and ""power off."" I don't need to be told these things. If I can figure out how to set it up, I can certainly determine when it's on or off, what mode it's in (just look at the receiver), and when it's connected. If there is any way to mute this voice or just turn it down, I have not been able to find it. But I do like the speakers and have decided that just maybe I will find a place for the other two after all.",[],B0BNJKGF71,B0BNJKGF71,AFGHCQ2SG3YTQGWTVTT25LMIOBGA,2023-04-05 23:53:28.832,0,False,497

Because trust is getting a little more difficult these days especially with the cars I have.<br /><br />This dash cam basically does everything I need it do to. I've used this on several trips now and fortunately have never really needed it other than one road rage incident.<br /><br />The picture quality is pretty good! Not great but good. Has some settings to adjust the angle and exposure. You're not going to catch a plate number if the conditions are bad (low light to headlight white out on plates ect) so I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for a serious rig.<br /><br />The mics are astounding. You can really hear almost everything with these!<br /><br />The front and rear cameras were easy to setup. I tucked the cables into my headliner. I did not choose to hardwire it although I may in the future.<br /><br />Then UI on the app is.... terrible. The wifi doesn't reach very far.. its slow... so don't plan on checking your car while in a store or restaurant like I can with an LTE cam. The motion detection works great! When it wants to. I tested it on my neighborhood one day and left it on the most sensitive setting. The rear camera caught my trees swaying in the wind a lot, ""major motion"" events but failed to capture a few joggers. This is disconcerting. I'm worried about the people not the trees. I kept having an issue with the app timing out before I could download a ""trip"" video that the give was 1.1GB. I could only get to about 700 MB before it would freeze up and stop. I restarted several times and still had the same issue. Ive found its best to just SCREEN RECORD your events while streaming the video through the app. Its impossible to download a file over a certain size it will just time out forever.<br /><br />Other than that it does as it should. Good features for a fair price.<br /><br />Please keep in mind ANYTHING is better than nothing. If you have the cheapest cam possible in your window it's still a deterrent!

21506,5,Updated:,"Update:<br />I will leave my review below, but I did update it to 5 stars. Anker is an amazing company that really supports its products and strives to make its customers happy. They went above and beyond to ensure I was happy with their product. I did not think companies like this really existed; they even went out of their way to contact me about my review.<br /><br />If you're looking for at purchasing a speaker like this, I would recommend their sound core 3 - it sounds better. The only issue is that they removed the 3.5mm audio jack. So my intended purchase of using it with my steam deck doesn't work well due to audio delay. The speaker itself sounds great, and I will use it for music.<br /><br />________________________________<br />I usually love Anker products, but this speaker is not for me. I bought it to use with my steam deck / pc for general sound use (I use headphones for gaming).<br />- The device sounded static/cracky. Almost like it was just too loud, or the speakers were blown. I tried it with my phone, and the sound quality was the same.<br />- I had issues with the volume. The speaker has its own volume, but you can also increase the volume on the device paired or connected to it. I was hoping to set the speaker to 100% and then use the paired device to fine-tune the controls, but this only worked sometimes. Most of the time, the speaker sounded blown unless I lowered one the two volumes. This could have been user error idk.<br />- Finally, audio delay. I had a delay with audio on both Bluetooth and, oddly enough, 3.5mm jack which is strange. I tried to update the firmware (which I read was a solution), but I could not get their android app to find the device. I followed all the instructions, the device was paired to my phone, yet still, their app would not find the device.<br />-- I even busted out my old windows laptop to download their windows app to update. That wouldn't find the device, either.<br /><br />Eventually I gave up. I am going to return the device and purchase another set of speakers.<br /><br />Anker is a great company who typically have wonderful products.

954384,3,They're ok with a ton of minor inconveniences,"They're ok.<br /><br />Reviews of headphones usually revolve around sound quality. These sound great, and my biggest worry, fit and comfort, with no ear/wingtips was actually it's best feature. After a few minutes, these were nice and secure inside my ear.<br /><br />The issues comes with everything else. First, the case is a bit bulky and cumbersome. The texture is nice and the light indication is ok when it works, but the size makes it less practical to carry compared to something like the Earfun Pro 2.<br /><br />Second, the controls are there, but they are not included in the manual and it's not guaranteed they'll work out of the box. When I first used my headphones, only the volume control worked. I had to charge the headphones in their case and resync them before the controls worked. They also included little indication beeps for hold controls, which include:<br /><br />1 second hold and 1 beep and release: assistant activation<br />2 beeps and release:  ambient mode/transparency mode<br />3 beeps and release: turn off manually<br />4 beeps and release: I still have no idea<br /><br />I like that all the controls are there, but the I didn't think I'd prefer touch controls when having to do all the different commands (I just wish touch controls had a disable feature when putting in and taking out the earphones so you didn't get accidental touches.<br /><br />Third, the app. This is something that I've learned using Soundpeats, Fiil, Soundcore, Earfun, and now Lypertek. A good universal app is nice. There is an app, specifically for this earphone. Don't make the mistake I did and get the Z5 app. I didn't get the connection issues other people got, but the app is light and it didn't really add much outside of light equalizer controls and a manual ambient button<br /><br />Fourth, weird things like charging indications and the headphones not turning off when I put them in the case just kept popping up. There are also complaints about the glue on them falling off after a few months, which has me worried. I was excited by these but the software inconveniences are the most between the other TWS headphones I've used under $100",[],B07VB46R9Y,B09RQX8WJQ,AET5R2TNGNXKXHWVYFDNDBYWVU3A,2023-03-30 01:32:35.854,0,True,497
426535,1,Samsung TV is garbage. Samsung product support is worse.,"First, to be clear: the soundbar is still working, so no complaints there.<br /><br />The television, however, is garbage. We started getting full-width lines of stuck pixels about a year and a half in. Then the entire panel died at two years.<br /><br />This is a $700 TV, I expect way better longevity than that.<br /><br />Worse than that: Samsung seems to go out of their way to obfuscate their warranty. Some sources say two years, some say one. Either is too cheap a warranty for a $700 piece of equipment.<br /><br />And then we get to Samsung customer support. They led us on a merry wild goose chase for more than two weeks. First we had to get a diagnostic from their singular authorized repair shop in a 100 mile radius, which we paid $60 out of pocket for. Turns out the part costs more than the whole TV. Then they agreed to a one-time repair and said the shop would contact us when the part came in. Almost a week later with no contact, we called the shop only to be told the part wasn't available. Why did no one call us to tell us that?<br /><br />Then we had to deal with a dozen calls to a dozen different reps AND supervisors who: hung up on us, transferred us to a dead line, lied to us (told us IN WRITING that we already had a support ticket for an exchange, then the supervisor responsible for said exchange denied that the ticket existed), continuously passed the buck. We were told to call another department so many times I lost count.<br /><br />Naturally, not only did Samsung not make any of this right, but they KEPT TRYING to waste our time. They never even just said ""No we won't help you"" but kept insisting that we call back to get another department (that just so happened to be closed at that moment, but we can call back tomorrow!)<br /><br />I.... don't even understand the point of all that. Wasting our time is wasting their own time. Lying to us doesn't even serve them. But Samsung is so dysfunctional that they would have KEPT GOING until the end of time, apparently.<br /><br />We will never buy Samsung again.

639815,4,Lightweight and lots of pockets for organization,"I've been in need of a new backpack to take to work commuting on bus and train. I wasn't sure what to expect in person, but I really like this backpack! First of all, the fabric seems to be nylon, but it's a bit stiff so it feels more sturdy and not flimsy. There is a bit of sheen to it, but it's not a tacky or cheap shiny look. I think it will do great in the rain, and when I did get a little bit of water dripping on it from my water bottle, it wiped right off. The straps are nice and padded and comfortable and there's a top handle for easy carrying. There is a luggage strap that you can use to loop over your suitcase handle for traveling. The zippers being a gold/coppery color is a nice touch and I like that the brand logo is rather subtle, just printed near the bottom of the bag rather than a huge emblem at the top.<br /><br />And the POCKETS!! I was impressed by how many compartments and pockets, including several zipped pockets there are in this bag! There are 4 main compartments, with the padded laptop area being at the very back. Within the 3 largest compartments there are zipped pockets. The smallest one in front has a key strap clasp. And I love the ""hidden"" zipped pocket at the back of the bag that is perfect for a wallet or phone. Little details like being able to lock together the zippers at the largest compartment and able to tuck the zipper in at the smallest front compartment are nice. I do wish they had locking zippers in the 2 middle compartments.<br /><br />Now for the slight drawbacks. Like some others have mentioned, the adjusting straps need constant adjusting. They remind me of a seat belt material but are really smooth so I think the buckle doesn't have enough grip to hold the strap in place. I'll have to see if I can figure out a diy hack for this. Also, the side pockets are rather small and would probably only hold a small water bottle.<br /><br />But overall I like this bag and it's a good value. It's got a lot of room and pockets to help keep you organized, but overall not bulky. I think it'll be great as a personal item or carry on when traveling. Hopefully it will be sturdy enough to last me years.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-PlYl0I9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-PlYl0I9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-PlYl0I9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711peVkxyVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711peVkxyVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711peVkxyVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71orMhkuW1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71orMhkuW1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71orMhkuW1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71x3liWtGuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71x3liWtGuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71x3liWtGuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09B28RY25,B09B29FFXC,AH6D233C36K6K3WRS3GLVB2OPRDQ,2023-01-18 17:30:55.636,19,True,497
913938,5,8 PoE Gigabit PoE ports at a good price and it works!,"This is my second SODALA switch. My first one (a 4 port model) has been running the several of the security cameras around my house since January and has worked quite well. This is basically identical to it, except with 8 port rather than 4, which I really like as that will let me get rid of three additional PoE injectors and consolidate them to one switch. So far, I did a bit of quick testing on this with a few phones (Grandstream, Fanvil, Vtech/SNOM) and a couple of security cameras (Reolink and Foscam). All worked fine (which is good, as the Vtech/SNOM is known for being quite picky and won't work with some of my PoE sources).<br /><br />That being said, the one device that did not work QUITE properly with this switch is a Netgear WAX615 access point from work, which I just plugged in out of curiosity. While the WAX615 fired up and works, it only detected this as a lower power 802.3af switch rather than 802.3at, so it operates in a reduced bandwidth mode. However, I am not going to knock any points off this review based on that, as, so far, the only PoE switch I have found that the WAX615 seems to work at full speed with is specifically one built by Netgear (go figure). As that is the only 802.3at device I have at the moment, I can't say for sure if that is an issue with the access point or with the 802.3at implementation in this switch (and several others).<br /><br />The VLAN and extend modes I have not tested, as they are not particularly useful for my own setup.<br /><br />The only criticism I have of this switch is that LEDs are all at the bottom and not very visible nor very informative (all they show is activity, not PoE status nor link speed). While I would really prefer them to be a bit better on this, for the price, I'm still not complaining.<br /><br />Overall though, I like this switch, it seems to work well for the devices I actually need it to work with, I like that it has dual uplink ports, I like that it has 8 PoE ports and a large power budget, and I like the price!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gxvgLl0vL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gxvgLl0vL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gxvgLl0vL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tVNnlUFZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tVNnlUFZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tVNnlUFZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814l5bEr39L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814l5bEr39L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814l5bEr39L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81XE3Nt0JOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81XE3Nt0JOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81XE3Nt0JOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BJ72MGPC,B0C2TDH778,AFDCRITLV6WGYKTAJAAMMSPWRTZQ,2023-04-11 18:15:49.200,0,False,497

If you have a wired keyboard and mouse, you take up 2 of those ports already and have only 1 available for something like a camera.  The USB-C port on this dock is usable as another USB port, but I am using this to deliver power.<br /><br />All of the ports on the device appear to work as expected.  The 3 USB 3.0 ports deliver data transfer at the speeds expected.  The card readers are able to read and write data to my SD cards.  The location of the card reader port is mildly inconvenient though, as they are on the back of the dock and would have preferred something on the side, as the back is generally closer to something like a wall.  I was able to achieve acceptable gigabit speeds via the connected ethernet port, measured through iperf.  The dual HDMI connectors were each able to produce video at 1080.<br /><br />The most frustrating thing about this dock is the short USB-C cable that is built into the dock.  The Fairikabe USB-C Docking Station is a wedge shaped dock, with rubber pads for your laptop on one side and rubber feet to maintain contact with a surface.  With the USB-C cable coming out of the left side of the dock, you are not able to reach the right side of your laptop with the cable if your USB-C port is on the right side.  I find this to be an odd oversight given the design of this dock has a specific orientation.<br /><br />Overall, I find that this dock is pretty useful.  I would consider this to be an affordable dock that could be used similarly to a commercial level dock, but for a more consumer setting.  My biggest gripe with this device is that the USB-C cable that is built-in is just too short and prevents me from connecting the dock to my laptop that has a right side USB-C port without purchasing a USB-C extender, which means it's not quite ready out of the box..",[],B0BL77L6WQ,B0BW8QXBRY,AHAYEB74UDOSS33IDY2NHH2XHHPA,2023-02-16 19:55:46.448,0,False,497

I just looked at the date when I bought these earbuds and they are coming up on 2 years .... which is way way way longer than any ear buds have ever  lasted me. I have been meaning to write a review on these for some time but something finally drove me to stop being lazy and finally do it. Yesterday  it appeared as if my Right ear bud was finally kicking the bucket. I noticed that it was seeming to not want to charge. I fiddled with it and could make it start charging with a little voodoo but i was sure that these ear buds were finally at their end.....until i decided to actually clean the metal connector pieces where it charges. Presto .....they are charging just fine and STILL going strong. I have half joked that when these finally die i will make them into a trophy on my wall and i really may end up doing this.

Overall its a great little device that has amazing battery life and can be controlled anywhere with the app on your phone.<br /><br />Set up:<br />Camera instructions are clear and most of the set up is through the VicoHome app. From there you add the Wifi (2.4 gz only - if you don't know what type of WiFi you have, then is 99% likely 2.4 gz)<br /><br />After setting up the camera through the app (and an initial firmware update), you are good to go. You could put the camera right on your table and it'll work! On my first night I put it in my basement and it only dropped 1% for the whole night!<br /><br />Installation:<br />The bracket is firm and easy to put the camera onto it with just a twist. The bracket can be screwed into the wall, but I used a couple zip ties to attach it to my pergola metal bars-- works perfectly and I can move it if I wanted. The WiFi antenna seems to be great, as my router is on the other side of my house and its picking up ""Strong"" signal outside on my deck. The solar panel is just as easy to install and you plug it into the back of the camera and the charge is automatic and always keeps my camera up at 100%.<br /><br />Use:<br />The app is super easy to use to connect and view the live feed. You can install a 128gb microSD card to save movement videos to it. The app will alert you to movements within its viewing range; you can edit the sensitivity from Low to High, and with High sensitivity, it was alerting me when a squirrel ran by 20 feet away, so its nice. Those motion activated videos are stored in the cloud for a couple days or your SD card if you use one too. The app does offer longer storage and higher volume if needed, but free plan is good for me.  You can move the lens so you can check on multiple areas and it has a wide angle lens so you see more in 1 area too.<br /><br />I highly recommend this camera, just a couple years ago this level of camera would be $300+.",[],B0BXRNV741,B0BXRNV741,AEPWTZRKAO7OWSH72LMDBS3OOMHQ,2023-04-10 23:04:11.272,4,True,497
243882,4,Good basic dash cam,"Since I don't have a dash cam, I decided this one was a good place to start. I haven't had a chance to try out all the features yet, but I can tell you how I feel about it so far. I ordered this for two reasons, but I wasn't as interested in the rear camera feature.<br /><br />First, I wanted a dash camera for when I'm out traveling in town for safety reasons and legal proof. Since this camera automatically begins recording as soon as you start your car as long as it is plugged in to charge, this seemed like a good fit for a beginner like myself. Basically, I flipped through the instruction booklet quickly and ran to plug it into my car. It started recording as soon as it was plugged in and my car was running, and it picked up the audio very well so, if you need a plug-and-go dash cam, this is definitely an option.<br /><br />The second reason I bought it was to record some basic travel videos for my local area. I was curious if I could record video and audio totally hands-free as I drove, and it worked pretty well. I still need to fasten the attached set up onto my window where I want it, but the recordings were pretty good with my own setup. One thing I learned is that I should have read all the instructions first! Ha! I say this because my camera recorded a bunch of one minute videos during my short trip because that's what it was set to do -- record and save every minute as a separate video. Be sure to change those settings so you have fewer videos to deal with, and be certain to set your dates and times because I realized that after the fact as well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty good little camera for an inexperienced dash cam person, but you will want to read the user manual first. I normally do, but this time I just wanted to get out and take a drive while filming. Don't forget that the memory card is set to record until it is full, and then it will record over the existing footage. If you want to use it for extended footage, be sure to keep some spare memory cards with you. I drove for about 90 minutes, and it used about one-third of the memory which I thought was pretty good. I look forward to putting this little camera through its paces as I make more videos.",[],B0BRQGQVL3,B0CB17BL81,AG5MB3VVQTRSEM7EYV4FMBREXU2Q,2023-03-30 20:57:30.132,0,False,497
862514,5,A Budget-Friendly Cable That Works as Advertised,"A few years ago when I first upgraded my home theater with an HDMI 2.1 compliant OLED TV, I decided to proactively run HDMI 2.1 compliant cables to all four inputs, since I knew it would be a challenge to add or replace any cables after installation. I purchased four identical cables from a well known brand that in the past, had always offered good value-for-money products. Big mistake.<br /><br />I've had numerous issues with my old cables over the last few years - primarily with 4K 120Hz VRR output from both PC and PS5 alike. While they did work, they'd often flicker or display a black screen until power cycled. I'm not sure if it was just bad luck -- i.e. I got four defective cables -- or I was paying the early adopter tax but regardless, enough was enough and I finally decided to rip everything apart and run some new cables.<br /><br />Rather than buy a new set of matched cables I suppressed my OCD tendencies and used cables that I've collected along the way along with a couple new ones including the TCNEWCL 8K@60Hz HDMI Cable. I used the TCNEWCL cable to connect my PS5 and after many hours of testing at 4K HDR 120Hz VRR, I'm happy to report that it works perfectly. No flickering, no black screens, no issues of any kind - it just works.<br /><br />There's nothing exceptional nor concerning about the exterior construction - it's as basic as they come and that's just fine because what matters is not what you can see rather, the internals you cannot. With regards to the internal quality, I can only make a determination based upon the TCNEWCL cable's performance and since it performs perfectly, I have to assume that the internals are of sufficient quality.<br /><br />Wrapping this up, the TCNEWCL 8K@60Hz HDMI Cable is exactly what it should be, an affordable cable that fully supports the HDMI 2.1 spec. With that in mind however, I am knocking a half point off my rating for one reason that is unrelated to the product itself - the price. As much as I consider the asking price to be fair, there are cables of a similar length that perform identically and are 50% (or more) less expensive. 4.5 out of 5 rounded up. Highly recommended.",[],B0BGN396XQ,B0BGN396XQ,AF3PYOJ6LG42OYPNOVOT3SEHMWOQ,2023-04-23 11:20:24.996,0,False,497
979741,5,"Great cable with proof of official certification to ""Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable"" standards","This cable is certified by the HDMI organization as an ""Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable"" and it includes proof on the package with a holographic label that includes a QR code which can be checked with a mobile phone app (see screenshot).  That certification means that it passsed independent HDMI lab testing so insure that it fully supports ""ALL HDMI 2.1a features including uncompressed 8k@60 and 4K@120 and up to 48Gbps bandwidth.""  (Note: I had to black out the HDMI ORG URL as well as the QR code as reviews with either shown in photos are rejected.)<br /><br />That's a big deal.  It means that you cannot improve on the performance of this cable at any price.  If you pay hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars for one of those ""videophile"" cables, it won't improve any aspect of television picture or sound.  As we engineers say, bits are bits and HDMI is a digital format.<br /><br />Inside of the bag is a cable packaged with care.  It includes two hook & loop cable ties, one at each connector.  They are just wrapped around and can be removed and reused.  Each connector shell is a handsome brushed aluminum imprinted with the company name and the cable use rating (8K ultra high speed).  These are protected from damage in shipping with yellow covers, insuring that they will arrive in pristine condition.  Each gold connector end is further protected with plastic HDMI connector covers; again, to prevent damage in transit.<br /><br />Once out of the packaging, the cable has good flexibility, especially considering the diameter and number of individual conductors.  I could live without the Scottish kilt color scheme, preferring black cables that blend in with the black equipment and smoked glass shelving, but that's just a personal preference thing.<br /><br />I'm using this cable between my Apple TV 4K and my Denon AV receiver.  It replaced an older cable not guaranteed to the current Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable standards.  This cable has performed flawlessly throughout rigorous testing (input switching, rebooting, and power cycling).<br /><br />I am happy to recommend this.  But whatever cable you buy, insist on the label with proof of HDMI standards testing.  I may be buying more of these to replace some other, older cables in my setup.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515mA2i8UQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515mA2i8UQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515mA2i8UQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51N-zTUtqML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51N-zTUtqML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51N-zTUtqML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615kCcvyajL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615kCcvyajL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615kCcvyajL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RAWH1gUtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RAWH1gUtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RAWH1gUtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61r4nA4lMpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61r4nA4lMpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61r4nA4lMpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vYWgfyBPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vYWgfyBPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vYWgfyBPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eKhoNhSCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eKhoNhSCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eKhoNhSCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09L5MDKFG,B0BZ3FLK4Y,AG7BFAQY664CVR2222SRIY25K5YQ,2023-03-24 14:32:08.136,0,False,497
655129,4,A little too much hassle for me,"I am always in need of power strips and surge protectors because I own every electrical device known to man and those things are hungry for power! I ordered this because I wanted a power strip with a small footprint. While this definitely fits that bill, other quirks about it make me reluctant to recommend it.<br /><br />The positives:<br /><br />- There are three outlets on the strip and each outlet can be set up as a smart plug<br />- It’s very compact, so it will fit in a small place<br />- Six foot cord is much more versatile than other strips with three foot cords<br /><br />The negatives:<br /><br />- Setting up smart functions is way too much trouble<br />- Smart plug use requires installing another application on your phone<br />- Plugs are way too close together, making it unlikely to be able to use all three at once<br />- Because of the aforementioned negatives, the value of this product relative to cost is low<br /><br />I really was excited to read the description of this power strip because it looked like just the thing I needed. I wanted something small that I could use with a smart light and to charge my phones. This does that, but it took way more time and effort to set up initially than I wanted to spend.<br /><br />When I realized that there was no way to avoid installing yet one more app in order to use the smart features of this strip, my enthusiasm waned considerably. Instead of integrating with Amazon Alexa or Google Home directly via AP, you have to install the BN-Live app and THEN connect the plug to Alexa or Google via the BN-Live app. Ridiculous - especially since the app and/or device itself is super buggy. It took me almost an hour to get the app to recognize the power strip. I eventually had to turn off my 5GHz network completely (which caused me to reset a bunch of other devices). I also had to take the power strip and move it right next to my router before the app would see it. Now that it is set up, the power strip no longer has to be next to the router, but it wouldn’t work initially unless the things were side by side. And this is not inexpensive, so look carefully for options that might be a better value for your money.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZkSIaEoxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZkSIaEoxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZkSIaEoxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BGN8MLB1,B09TNV7Q69,AHJ6CON7ZCJTZOE6CM2JIJMQEM5A,2023-01-26 23:31:02.067,0,False,497
496811,5,Very Impressive Signal Strength and Range for a Budget Price,"I have tested many budget wireless routers trying to find one with good 2.4ghz wifi in the $40-80 range.  I have used Linksys, Asus, Netgear, TPLink and many other home grade routers.  My house is not even very big, but wifi signal was close to -70dbm on the second floor in one bedroom and also the bathroom.  Had been thinking about going to a Unifi setup and almost pulled the trigger on a U6 Lite.  But the price and needing a Unifi controller to get the most out of the setup made me hesitate.<br /><br />Saw reviews on the TPLink Omada and APs and many positive reviews.  For half the price of a U6 Lite with POE included it seemed worth a try.  I have a Proxnox server running 24/7 with OPNSense VM as my firewall/router so adding a VM to run the Omada SDN controller software was easy.  I had all the WLAN settings configured before the EAP225 even arrived at my door.  Once I had it plugged in and adopted, it only took a few minutes to be fully up and running.  Running speedtests on laptop and cell phone and right off the bat download and upload speeds were very impressive over anything I had before.  The real test would be the bedroom upstairs and the bathroom and it didn't disappoint.  Wifi signal was about -60dbm.  The signal strength and range was really good.  Before I bought the EAP225 I had thought I would need to run two in mesh, but after testing for a few days now, just one EAP225 is working for all that I needed.<br /><br />Almost all the reviews for the EAP225 are for the V3 version and that is what i thought I would be receiving.  However I was sent the V4.  I didn't notice any downsides to this.  So probably not a big deal.<br /><br />Overall very satisfied with the EAP225V4 so far.  I'm really liking the Omada ecosystem and who knows, I may get the itch to get another EAP225 or a EAP245 in the future to try a mesh setup.  Definitely looking forward to see if I can get even more improvement out of the TPLink Omada products.",[],B0781YXFBT,B07953S2FD,AFV7HKELUBNSVR5OKDPTBXO3PTOA,2023-02-03 21:55:06.281,1,True,497
34972,4,Great value for money and good support.,"I took a chance with these recertified drives (bought directly from water panther, a little cheaper than on Amazon) based on the price.  Last summer I rebuilt my NAS and after shopping around for options decided to try 12tb drives.  Ordered four, tested them for about a month, found a few odd things (the serial number on the drive did not match the serial reported by smart for instance) but otherwise no major issues.  Ordered 4 more, tested those then set up a ZFS RAIDZ2 array and started moving my data over.<br /><br />Recently during my weekly long smart test one drive made a horrible grinding noise and I knew immediately it was bad.  Checked TrueNas and sure enough ""array degraded"" and though the system still saw the drive I couldn't get any smart info from it.  Contacted customer support, got an RMA#, shipped the drive back and have the replacement resilvering now in about a week.<br /><br />I'll admit to a bit of laziness, I was supposed to buy 2 more drives as spares but never got around to it.  I'll be doing that but the RMA process was painless and fast which is a very good thing.  While I couldn't be sure what the original drives were initially (an arsenal label covered the top of the drive) the replacement was a recertified Seagate EXOS x14 and this time the serial on the drive matches what is reported by smart.<br /><br />These particular drives do run on the louder side but I'm in the process of virtualizing my NAS and the drives will soon be in a fractal R5 case which should help with the noise.  Before I purchased these drives I tried to find out if these were worth the price savings and the results were mixed.  After going through the RMA process I'm satisfied, having worked in the IT drives going bad is just a fact of life, I don't hold that against anyone.<br /><br />If I were buying for a business/enterprise I'd go with new retail drives for the longer warranty but for my home lab paying half the cost of a retail drive with a reliable 2 year warranty backing it is kind of a no brainer.

444000,4,Decent First Projector If Expectations Are Realistic,"This projector is okay if expectations are realistic about what one is getting for something in this price range.  It is a budget projector with budget specs, so don’t expect to be dazzled by a sharp, bright picture.  The brightness is listed as 9000 lumens, and I think it’s safe to assume they mean “light source lumens” and not the more accurate method to measure brightness, which is ANSI lumens.  The 9000 lumens calculate to 300 ANSI lumens, which looks pretty washed out if there is any degree of ambient light in the room.  I did understand the limitations of this projector when I ordered it, and my intended use is in a “garage theater” in which I can create a completely light-free environment.  Again, I have realistic expectations about the performance of this projector, and it was never intended to be my primary source for viewing movies or sports, but rather for a bit of family fun time in which I am willing to make quite a few concessions.  Setup is simple and both the Bluetooth and WiFi connected quickly and without any issues.  Control-wise, there is nothing fancy going on with manual keystone correction and focus.  The audio is expectedly low quality, but it was always my intention to use an external amplified audio source anyway.  Something that is only mentioned kind of in passing in the manual is that this projector can’t process (or passthrough) Dolby audio, which I’m sure is a licensing issue.  I wanted to connect a PC to this projector and stream through my Plex server, but all of my nearly 900 movies are in Dolby Digital, so there is no audio.  My available workarounds are to use a Roku which downmixes to stereo, or convert my audio to AAC on an “as needed” basis.  The Roku is the easier option, even if I don’t get the snappier response like I do from my more powerful PC.  My biggest complaint is the noisy fan, and, if it is at all possible, I may take a stab at replacing it with something quieter.<br /><br />It’s decent for a first projector if it can be set up in a very dark room and if the use is more about the get-together with family and friends versus expecting an incredible cinematic experience.",[],B0B7MYBDR2,B0B7MYBDR2,AFYG2TNCQDTVPJH5S5CMOPPTTURA,2023-01-18 19:02:35.332,0,False,497

I didn't test to see if it charged multiple devices as it claims but you'd need a decent charger on the other end and it's going to make some tradeoffs.  I put this on a 25W PD charger and my phone loved it.  I tried it with a USB-A quick charge too, no problem.  I mostly want one at a time, just pick the right end.  Nice to know they can share if needed though, and this makes it a great solution for travel.  This is a good excuse to buy one of those 100W usb-c chargers  :)<br /><br />UPDATE: I got a bigger PD charger.  This cable does NOT do the right handshake to enable ""super fast charging""  (USBC -> USBC) that the included cable does.  I'm not too worried about it, the extra juice really only benefits the first part of charging from a completely empty battery.  It DOES power my laptop that requires 65W.  It still does fast charging and it works with multiple devices but this shows me it can't replace some of my existing cables.<br /><br />Apparently this does data  on one connection, either USB-C or Lightning.  But let's not call this high speed data!  They say it is 480MBps, so that's USB-2 speed (USB-3 starts at 5GBps) and nothing to get too excited about.

238848,4,Incredible Value Smartwatch At An Incredible Pricepoint,"I have purchased everything from kids smart watches, right up to the high-end name brands, and I have to say, this may be one of my favorites.  In fact I love it so much, I bought a second.<br /><br />Right out of the box, this watch, exudes quality, intuitiveness, familiarity, and it’s jam-packed with feature-rich apps and functionality. I would even go as far to say, as it has a near exact look, feel, and function of its higher priced name-brand counterpart.<br /><br />It does come mostly charged out of the box, but it will also charge from a “dead state” in just a couple hours, and offers multiple days of use (depending on how much you use the apps.).

518817,4,"The specs are correct, RGB lighting much dimmer than pictured","As some have noted, Amazon has the wrong model number listed which might create an issue if you needed to return, but the specs as shown are correct. The difference is the 12UHS has twice the RAM and hard drive space than the 12UGS. Otherwise these are the same laptop. For the $400 price increase for the 12UHS, is it cheaper to upgrade the RAM and SSD yourself.<br /><br />This thing is a gaming beast and you will not be disappointed in it's performance. Testing the CPU speed shows it goes to 4.2 Ghz under load.<br /><br />The screen is a true 240hz monitor with no significant motion ghosting and is bright with no obvious dark zones or flash lighting. The UFO screen test shows crisp graphics at the promised refresh rate.<br /><br />The speakers are above average for a laptop. There are two tweeter/mids on each side of the keyboard top and two side firing subs which go down to about 100hz. The result is a good clear sound stage with warm sound. The highest volume level might not cut it in a noisy environment tho.<br /><br />Start up is fast and applications load very quickly.<br /><br />The bad which soured my over all rating:<br /><br />Disappointed in the RGB lighting. Controlling it is not easy even with the software needed to change per key or whole lighting effects. No where in the app is a control for keyboard brightness and the supposed short cut key combo has no effect on the brightness level. Pretty much useless unless you are playing in the dark. Out of the box they keys are dim as is the front bar that is shown to be glowing brightly in the product images. I was able to adjust the bar brightness successfully, but the brightest setting isn't bright at all. Definitely a case of false advertising by MSI. Now of course you don't buy a gaming laptop for the bling, but is a sin to over promise and under deliver especially at the 2k price point. If you are choosing this over other gaming laptops for the RGB lighting, choose something else.<br /><br />Windows 11 is horrible. It took a lot of work to get it to look like I wanted to, especially the taskbar, but was worth it, mostly. This isn't MSI's fault, but Windows 10 would have been better as it is more customizable.",[],B0B2KW7ZB6,B0BY36H3QM,AEWQO57J7ILRDX6IEUE7YFL6WHHA,2023-02-17 07:20:20.224,3,True,497
170533,4,Excellent amazon based tablet with some amazon centric issues,"I got this tablet after trying an apple ipad and the microsoft surface go 3.  So, I can say from my standpoint I like this fire hd 10 better than the other two tablets for a couple of different reasons.  First of all the cost is a significant difference from the Surface Go 3, and if you are not a member of the apple community the apple ipad is extremely difficult to integrate into your android based ecosystrm.<br /><br />The fire tablet has much similar form factor to the surface go 3.  The screen is very colorful, detailed and bright.  It is responsive and logical to get around on.  The one little issue with the tablet is it's amazon centric software and apps that are difficult to work around.  So, if you like the amazon web browser and are happy with it's email and other apps you will be very happy with it as it comes to you.  BUT, if you are one of millions who prefer Google Chrome as your browser and associated apps like gmail and google drive you will have some work to do to get those apps on this tablet.  It's not impossible but it is not for someone to do that does not have some comfort in downloading some apk files and executing them to get chrome on the tablet.  There are a couple good tutorials on the web that explain how to do this.  So, if it wasn't for this hassle to get other apps on the Fire HD 10 I would give this product a solid 5 star rating.<br /><br />Another very positive factor in liking this tablet is the ability to add internal storage space with an sdhc card slot.  Great!  This was another factor in my preference for this tablet over the other two.  One small issue with this tablet is the apps screen on startup.  Amazon will not let you get rid of many of the apps or even hide them if you don't want them on the tablet.  There is one small workaround to this if you don't want them cluttering up your screen and that is to put them in the ""Utility"" group on the front page.  Some of the decisions these makers of tablets make continue to amaze me with their shortsightedness and selfish behavior when it would be so much better for the customer and hence sales of the product to design it for the customer's benefit, ease of use, etc.",[],B08BX81SLK,B08YFJYD5Z,AHKMTUXMBXW364U3EXGWFT6YNRTQ,2023-01-11 15:57:41.750,210,True,497
525872,1,"Too big for one-handed use, hair-trigger power button, though warm screen is nice","This is my 3rd kindle over ten years, and I've been a long time fan/user. In short - if you carry your kindle everywhere with you like I do then the bigger size of this unit and the hair-trigger power buttons are both net problems.<br /><br />For size: this is constantly falling out of my pockets and is uncomfortable when holding with one hand. The smaller legacy devices for the Paperwhite/Voyage/etc. all comfortably fit into the back pocket of my (men's) pants. That's out the window now. Best case I get about 2/3 of this unit and then it feels like I'm carrying around textbook wedged in there. It also no longer fits entirely into most of my coat pockets (side or breast pockets), so I have it hanging out on pockets where my old devices fit fine. As a result - I've had this for about two weeks and have dropped it a dozen times just sitting on a chair or in the car.<br /><br />For the power button: this is constantly turning on in my pocket despite my efforts to not press the button. The screen sensitivity is also such that I have had to walk back 10-20 pages in whatever book I'm reading. I've been reading a book or two per month on kindle for 10 years and, though this has happened to me once in a while, it is frustratingly common so far with this new one.<br /><br />Lastly - both of these issues combine to make single handed reading for right-handed folks a cramp-inducing mess. For better or worse there's not much bezel area to pinch to hold the device up without accidental page turns. The side effect is that I naturally start to prop up the device with my pinky finger, which then hits the power button and turns off the screen. I have to hold much of the weight of the device on just the tip of my pinky finger (which gets painful) or otherwise use it two handed / propped up.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this device for the warm light, and that feature is a great relief, but I'm having trouble overcoming the discomfort/inconvenience of not being able to throw it in my back pocket and then pull it out to read one handed while waiting in line or laying on the couch. I don't know if I'll keep it.",[],B08KTZ8249,B09F7TGV1H,AHHU5CADV4FHPWP42AI2SM4GI5SQ,2023-03-20 18:07:45.030,13,True,497

After multiple calls to Amazon customer service, an agent said he has to send an internal note to a heavy and bulk department to manually ask Pilot to initiate the pickup.<br /><br />The next day, I get an email from Pilot to schedule a pick up and the TV was picked up, returned to Amazon warehouse as per Pilot tracking.<br /><br />Now another round of calls to Amazon to process the refund and was finally said someone will contact me over email as the refund team is not available on phone.

535410,5,Updated review,"I have never updated a review. I want to in this case. This PC is awesome. I left a negative review. I want to change my review. I wish to state I I copied my first review and plan to paste it in at the end of this updated review. I no longer place blame on jack's shop or Minisforum. I now have had 3 PC's that failed because of Windows 11 updates. In each of those incidents this same thing occurred. As most of you know when installing a Windows update restarting the PC is part of the installation. My 3 PC's that got messed up all did the same thing. Windows update appeared to be installing normally during the shutting down phase. However, during the starting back up phase all I got was a black screen. So I now blame Microsoft. I read news yesterday. Many others besides myself has had the same thing happen. My advice is to use Windows 10 until this issue is resolved. Also many people have successfully installed this update I don't know how a person is to know in advance if their PC will install the update successfully. I do know nobody wants to deal with this. This was my original review:<br /><br /> I connected it and used it for awhile (2 weeks) a short while then I was told Windows had an update. I thought sure update windows. The PC has never booted since. Before that update I used this PC and was so happy with it. When that update occurred I contacted Minisforum. They replied that I failed to update the BIOS. They were saying in a nutshell that it was my fault for not updating the BIOS. I had it only 2 weeks. I have updated a BIOS before. Straight out of the box it needs a BIOS update or it will crash because of Windows update. Really how was I to know it needed to have a BIOS update or Windows update will crash it. When it worked it was totally awesome. I am posting this to inform new buyers, the very first thing they should do is find out if they need to update the BIOS or they may have the same thing happen them. They sold me a Windows PC with a BIOS that can't handle a windows update. Then said it was my fault for not updating the BIOS. It wasn't my fault like they (Minisforum) says they sold me a new PC with a flawed BIOS. They didn't want to backup their product so they blamed me.",[],B0BP1S1YNS,B0BTM8K8PY,AHJ3VHNLUZMYPVS3QTGCWVO6ABLA,2023-03-29 21:30:17.244,0,True,497
764761,5,Finally A Motherboard that works!,"Long story short, this was my fourth motherboard in a string of three others (other brands and models but all x570s) that were DOA.  I have this up and running for over a week and it is performing as it should.  It is the only one of the group that is WiFi capable which is a feature I do not need/use.  Irony, right?<br /><br />It has the features I was looking for, but it would have been better if it had two 3-pin addressable headers for RGB devices.  The second NVMe slot comes with a heat spreader/sink but since my drives already have their own, I had to leave it off the build.  Not a big deal.<br /><br />I use air cooling so the thoughtful headers for AIO type cooling are nice to have if I ever decide to make the switch.<br /><br />Compared to the other three fails (2 MSI and 1 other ASUS) this is a solid performer and handles my Ryzen 7 5800X with 32 Gigs of Corsair Vengeance RAM with no problems.  The BIOS is easy enough to navigate and allowed me to set things as I wanted them.  I am not an overclocker.<br /><br />It does have a small RGB light on the back of the board which makes for a subtle display inside my all white case.  I have not yet explored if that can be turned off.  It does stay on with the PC off.  I have to switch the power supply off to have these lights off.  But again, I have not explored other options, such as in the BIOS, to have them turn off when the PC shuts off.  It is no big deal for me, but perhaps it might be for you.  I am just happy to have a board that actually works!<br /><br />It is the heart of my new gaming rig.  I went with a MSI RX6700XT and paired it all with a nice LG 32"" 165Hz 2K monitor and I never knew how great my games looked until this setup was operational.  I upgraded from a 10+ year-old rig running a FX6100 and a 1050Ti - I know, a museum piece.  I love the new speed and power this board affords me.  I am a happy gamer.

444269,2,Marine Radio it is not,"This product is depicted as being used on a open speedboat.<br />1) The display on the one I have is so dim it is unreadable until dusk.<br />2) The sensitivity of the radio is not very good. As radio transmitter towers don’t line our coasts I assumed it would excel in sensitivity but it doesn’t.<br />3). None of the settings or saved radio stations are stored in non-volatile memory. So every time the 12v is lost, it forgets everything and you have to start again with an awkward setup procedure.<br />4) The gasket. I contacted Pyle Tech support on this issue and they were very underwhelming in response. The radio comes with a sleeve. The sleeve fitted nicely into the double Din opening of the metal panel I was mounting it in. There are bend back tabs on the sleeve that, combined with a front flange, hold it rock solid. The radio slides into the sleeve quite smoothly. It also has flanges on each side that sit on top of the sleeve flanges, to stop it from being pushed in too far. That’s all good. But then there is a plastic rectangular trim that slides over the front of the radio to finish off the look and hide the flanges. It sits on top of the flanges and has no features to wrap around them and provide a seal to the panel. So it sits nearly a quarter inch proud of the panel and makes a great opening for water ingress. And looks bad at the same time.<br />5). The Bluetooth has a range of about 2 feet, although it does stay connected.<br />I’m not impressed with either the product or their technical support.<br />UPDATE:  I finally did something good with this product. I threw it away. I found the radio was being swamped by rf emissions by an adjacent digital voltmeter on the same panel, and when I powered that off could receive twice as many radio broadcast stations. I finally replaced it with another manufacturers product at twice the price. That was the first good decision I have made with this radio. I now get 4 times the number of radio stations I could get from this thing on a good day. I can read the display in daylight. The trim for the radio actually fits snug to the panel. And the voltmeter is powered up again as is doesn’t affect reception.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RiQeWPcOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RiQeWPcOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RiQeWPcOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZgjNe8UGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZgjNe8UGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZgjNe8UGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0856DY64Q,B0856DY64Q,AHGA23XSQKRV5HRQYYUBWIP7EEBA,2023-01-08 04:35:49.145,0,True,497
656267,3,"A perplexing device, could be great if not for deal-killer annoyances","On paper, this is one of the best (and one of only a very few) smaller tablets still available. And by ""smaller"" I mean hold-in-one-hand size, with a screen in the 8 inch realm. An iPad mini is the other obvious option, but it's pretty expensive for what it is, and has its own drawbacks. So I opted to give a Fire a try.<br />Many things to like: it seems solidly built, has good resolution, and reasonable performance. It's a pretty lightweight device, too -- light enough for one-handed use, and isn't awkward to handle for super casual use.<br />From there, though, are so many negative factors. First and foremost: I really wish Amazon and Google would work things out such that their devices and services worked together. I get that they each have to protect certain aspects of their respective marketing domains, but not allowing the Google Play store for an Android device is frankly ridiculous. It's just too limiting. (To be fair, Google not allowing one to make in-app purchases from Amazon is equally limiting.) I think very few people live exclusively in the Google or Amazon ecosphere. Making it overly inconvenient to access one, from the other, works against consumers and -- ironically -- makes certain devices or services a non-starter (at least for me).<br />Then there's the issue of the Kindle app -- on the Kindle device. How on earth is the Kindle app, on the Kindle device, so much worse than the Kindle app on any other Android device? Why, on my phone for example, can I adjust font sizes, type faces, colors, spacing, et al., with about twice as many different options as on the Kindle-based Kindle app? How does this make any sense?<br />The limitations on customizing the home screen are maddening. I paid for an ad-free device, but the ""recommendations"" banner on the home screen seemingly can't be dispensed with.<br />I returned the Kindle Fire; replaced it with a Samsung A7 Lite, and couldn't be happier with the switch. About the same price, but the Samsung is agnostically Android-native. The Kindle app is the same I've become used to on my phone, and the device overall is simply better. I won't buy such a heavily brand-specific device again, that's for sure.",[],B09BG5P9JH,B0B9J49GLL,AETQ3BJDR6ZP623U5PWJASVF5VPQ,2023-03-26 18:06:03.066,0,True,497

829961,3,Opinion; On PC Monitors overall,"For me, it's LG then everything else as it relates to quality.  PC Monitors are just terrible.  I'm not saying that PC Monitors can barely be made out, but it just really sad that out of all the budget monitors, this is probably the best.  Now I'm not saying that there aren't any 4k monitors are good, but really 1440p monitors w/high refresh monitors are really gaming monitors.  1440p is highly efficient with high refresh rate.  To me if you're going 4K, you really need to get an LG monitor.  Getting a 4K LCD really doesn't make sense.  So since I don't have OLED LG money right now, I'm going for the 1440p ultra wide.  I make and build content for youtube on transformational gaming.  So Ultra wide is what I'm looking for.  Sadly, this is the best 1440p wide monitor there is as far as budget.  This has a high refresh rate and all the bells and whistles with gSync.  But the bad news is that the color and picture are terrible.  And when I say terrible I mean compared to OLED.  I have the CX 65 inch in my living room.  When I come back to this monitor, it just looks that much worse.  I wish they can do updates to this tv like the LG.  I'm sure there are some calibration they can do to make it better.  But wow... if you want a wide screen with high refresh rates at 1440, you have to settles for this monitor.  You can go for a 2400x1440 if you play games but again I need ultra wide at 3440x1440p for content creation.  So eventually I'm going to get a 4K OLED monitor but right now to me it's this one that has everything I need and it's the only brand that has it.  So it's almost like a monopoly at least at this price point.  I'll make a video about this product soon.<br />Lastly, if you're moving from one place to another, my advice is to keep the box that it came with and put the monitor back in the box while moving.  Anything else and you're going to end like me and have to replace it.  That's right, this thing cracks like an egg.  I'll talk about this more on the channel.",[],B07ZB2TNZZ,B0BYKKW1GF,AG3PZOPFN2YYOPXGEYK5T762Y3MA,2023-01-17 00:31:30.398,2,True,496
575562,4,Nice to have if you’re used to using a trackpad,"My mouse recently quit working and refused to get repaired, and when I saw this, I decided to get it instead of another mouse. I had used laptops quite a bit and got to the point where I preferred the trackpad to using an external mouse, mostly because the mouse required finding more room to work in. And that is why I thought this might be a good idea. The same holds true on a desktop.<br /><br />It did take some getting used to again, but the images on the pad itself are a huge help to mimic anything you’d do with a regular mouse, and they’re handy, so you don’t have to hunting for how to do some of the basic clicks, like a right click. But even looking up the function isn’t all that onerous because the instruction booklet contains a little chart that I just kept next to my monitor for the first couple of weeks using this.<br /><br />In Windows 11 (I can’t speak for any other version), the sensitivity is just one of many things you can personalize, but I found the default medium senitivity setting to be perfect. I can hover my fingers over the pad without it interpreting that as a click of some sort. In fact, the default settings were all pretty intuitive, so I didn’t change anything other than the pointer speed, which I like faster than normal. I think this is a good product, and I certainly recommend it, whether or not you’ve used trackpads in the past. Just know that if you haven’t, it will take some time to get used to using this instead of a mouse, but you may find it worth the effort.<br /><br />The overall score had one star knocked off because it’s not the best ergonomics. Indeed, after using only the trackpad for a couple of weeks, I had to get a new ergonomic mouse because my carpal tunnel was threatening to act up again. Note, however, that has everything to do with individual setup in terms of things like height of your chair versus height of where the trackpad is located. My computer desk is such that I had to bend my wrist too much using the trackpad. But if it had been set up where I was higher than normal with respect to the trackpad, I doubt I would’ve had a problem.",[],B0B93RSRLM,B0B93RSRLM,AHOLB3AEXBQSSPUTLX4IX7RIGA3Q,2023-01-03 04:27:40.548,4,False,496
966225,4,"a lot of good features, but over priced","I bought this because of some of the features which are unique.  I like to build small efficient computers, but some cases are just too small.  This one is just right.  I have two NVme drives and a SATA SSD and it still runs cool.  I'm using a Gigabyte Aorus B550i with a Ryzen 5 5600G.  I don't play games but do some design and photo work.<br />Things I like:<br />4 USB3.0 ports in front.<br />Tall enough to allow decent airflow and space for easy assembly.  I have used smaller cases which are a real pain to assemble.<br />The side/top cover could easily be replaced with acrylic instead, or even add a spacer to raise lid for more space.<br />You can use it horizontally or vertically.<br />Plenty of ventilation.<br /><br />Things that need improvement:<br />The red drive LED is not visible as it arrived.  The red led can be bent so the tip is near the flange of the white power switch ring, about 45 degrees away from the circuit board.  Then you will at least see some flashing though the white outer ring--kind of dim but visible.  They could have drilled a tiny hole for the red led and it would have shown through the front panel.  Or used a dimmer LED for power on, perhaps just using a larger resistor or lower lumen LED.  What were they thinking (if even)?<br />My cover had a ding near one of the countersunk screws.  It must have been hit with a drill chuck or other tool.  The corner was slight bent because of that.  However, it was not something I would return it over.  I just accepted it.  Nevertheless, the pricing does not fit with manufacturing errors of this sort.<br />What are all those 9 pin delta cutouts on the back for?  I did use an XT60 male connector near the PCIe slot for mounting a high amperage DC connector for my Geetech 250W PSU and external 250W LED driver.  So that was okay.  But that area could have had a slot for a low profile PCIe single slot video card.  There is no way I would have used a two slot card mounted overhead.  That would have added a lot of heat and may have required more power.",[],B08P1M8VZ2,B08P1M8VZ2,AGSZUT65LK6OHCMQ5TD2G64AWUNQ,2023-01-31 22:04:10.125,0,True,496
699768,5,Huge upgrade from last projector,"Me and my wife bought a $40 project to use in our bedroom since we couldn't hang a TV up. It was the little yellow and white box one that you see most commonly marketed as a mini projector. It did the job but we had some complaints. It was noisy, the picture quality was ok at best and the system did not come with any integration, only phone mirroring. We quickly found out that phone mirroring didn't work with Netflix as it would block the picture, so we were forced to use an old Roku that we had. After about 9 months that ones fan finally gave out and we threw the system out.<br /><br />I decided since we were getting a new one and we had been using it a lot that this would be a nice upgrade, but I am so happy with this. Some things to take into mind: I was upgrading from a $40 projector so I might be biased since this is leaps and bounds better.<br /><br />Picture Quality: great, the projection size is very large, and the picture quality is crisp. Most the time we are watching in a dark room so I can't say much about the brightness, but from my experience I have no issues there. It does say it comes with autofocus, I never really got it to work but I can focus it fine without it.<br /><br />Noise: Very good. My last one was very noisy, and we had to keep the volume of the speaker we hooked up to it at 100% to overcome this noise consistently. This one we keep the speaker about 50-60% and are more than happy with it. Even when running it for 3-4 hours at a time we will forget the noise is even there.<br /><br />Android integration: This is the only place where this system might lose a point. To be fair there isn't many projectors with integration within this price range, so the choices are limited. But this one is a little laggy on response time. Some apps are worse than others for sure. Netflix has about a 1/2 sec delay on the remote where Crunchyroll has about 1.5-2 sec delay. Overall, it doesn't make it unusable, but it can be annoying at times.<br /><br />TLDR: Good picture quality, good brightness, relatively quite fan, android integration is usable but can be laggy.",[],B09W99PTST,B09W99PTST,AG2PTBJJRJBKA5FL3DE3NRKCPL5Q,2023-02-28 16:52:41.190,1,True,496

Sadly I only used it for 4 battery cycles, meaning I only got to charge it 4 times, before the horribly made charging port sank in beyond my ability to retrieve it making it completely useless to me for anything beyond an angry discussion piece thereby setting the mood for a dinner filled with rage & indigestion as well as the rage & indigestion causing flares of vomiting up our food there after. I will say I enjoyed it the short time I was allowed to utilize it but I ponder if it was set up by it's makers to do exactly that. Maybe it's intent was to cause country wide vomiting around dinner time thereby giving out enemies a good time to attack both our military as well as our countries soft target which could possibly take out 25% or more of our global capabilities. Maybe I'm just insane with rage caused by this camera but maybe not. I've never been institutionalized but neither have most serial killers. None the less this horribly product broke to the point of uselessness for it's purpose & I completely regret buying it. I guess I got what I paid for but at least if I paid for manure I could throw it in my garden for use as fertilizer but with this, sadly,I cannot. If this camera was a house tell your children to pass by rapidly & never knock on it's door less they risk dancing with the devil who likes their dancing partner to glide with shattered legs.

359526,5,Amazing Earbuds,"These Are Amazing Earbuds!<br /><br />Now, I've had a few earbuds in the past, but these are Hands Down the Best I've ever had. Let's start with the sound quality. You can get some pretty decent sound from a cheap set of earbuds. But what you can't get is sound that seems to track your movement giving you a True feeling of 360 degree sound. Meaning, not only does your music sound better, but if you have them connected to a TV or other movie watching device You'll have an Excellent movie watching experience.<br /><br />Speaking of that... While watching a YouTube video, I got a phone call. Usually, my other headphones or buds would stop the sound from the video in favor of the call. But with These, the video sound kept playing, but at a lower volume that my call, meaning I could enjoy both without any loss of quality.<br /><br />Speaking of quality... Let's discuss fit. For Me... Fit is very important. So much so, I went back to headphones because I couldn't get a good fit on previous earbuds. It gets really frustrating when you have to spend so much time trying to keep an earbud in place. They fall out, lose sound quality because they won't stay in right and just didn't seem to work well for me.<br /><br />With These earbuds, that's a thing of the past. Once you get them in right, they Stay right! I mean, you can jump, twist and shake your head all you want, they just stay put. No more adjusting and readjusting, they stay right there. Not only That, but they are Comfortable! After a short while, you hardly feel them anymore, meaning you can go the whole day long without discomfort.<br /><br />Speaking of the whole day. The battery life is just as amazing. You wouldn't expect something this small, that sounds this good to last so long. But you should be able to get 5 hours or more out of them, not to mention that (some Samsung phone users) can charge these with their phone.<br /><br />There's also the ability to locate lost buds as well.<br /><br />All N All, I'd have to say that these are an Amazing pair of Earbuds, Well worth the price.",[],B08HDKHSKS,B08HDKHSKS,AH6PYV54GUXSW6TOQE65A2XHZ4DA,2023-04-01 16:31:17.764,0,True,496

I have Monoprice Premium Certified cables, 4K@60Hz/HDR/18Gbps/28AWG/YUV4:4:4. One plugs into my Mac, the other into my Denon AVR-X3600H 4K receiver, the third into my LG 4K monitor.  The cables are short.<br /><br />However, this HDMI switch doesn't quite work; it *almost* works. It will produce an image on the monitor  and from the Denon, but both have scan line problems.  Especially if I move the mouse around on the screen quickly.  So the little box is struggling. All of the cables work fine connected directly to the computer.<br /><br />The HDMI switch itself is very small, with 2 HDMI ports on one side, 1 HDMI port on the other side, and a USB-A to USB-C cable for power.  The switch has the USB-C connector. The push button switches between ""1"" and ""2"" as indicated with little lights.<br /><br />I have tried another unit previously (GANA) that didn't have power and it didn't produce an image.  At least this Avedio unit produces *an* image.  So I think that having the power port is indeed important for this kind of switch with Macs.<br /><br />I really wanted this unit to work but it isn't quite up to the task.<br /><br />Scott<br /><br />Edit:  I received several email messages from the company and they were very eager to assist in addressing the problem.  We weren't able to get it to work with my Mac and in googling around I suspect that the problem is with the Mac.

There is crackling/noise sometimes while using the SPDIF out when a song starts, and the Chromecast over bluetooth doesn't work (WiFi, from YouTube Music to Chromecast then Paired Bluetooth Speakers) but WiiM responded quackly over their forums to let me know they were aware and added to the Known Issues and promised to fix it in future firmware updates.<br /><br />Overall, i know that it may sound that i had a cautious review, but i think it's a 5 star product and that once the couple of bugs are polished (i know that the crackling is firmware fixable as it's a digital output, and the chromecast over bluetooth pairing is as well) then this would be exactly what i've been asking for, i have a set of 2 amplified speakers and a subwoofer plugged to it and it's a joy to use and listen, also that the dev. team is responsive and fixing the issues means that this is a company with future, recommended!",[],B0BJDY6D1W,B0C5CXY59T,AGVY6UGSDHAZQRUKCY45VKOHTJ6Q,2023-01-25 02:14:29.883,0,False,496
149385,5,Comfortable and Full-Sized with Nice Features,"This is a full-sized keyboard and I find it more comfortable to type on than a laptop keyboard.  The design reminds me of an Apple product.  This was plug and play with my Linux system as any keyboard should be.  The bluetooth option connected very quickly on an Android tablet.  The 'Alt' key doubles as a 'Cmd' key for Mac users and there is an Option key that doubles as a 'Win' (or menu) key for Windows, Linux, BSD, etc.<br /><br />What I Like:<br />1. Full Sized<br />2. Wireless<br />3. Large Backspace key.  This makes it easy to correct my mistakes without having to look at the keyboard.<br />4.  The lights go off after a period of time of non use.  An example is the Num Lock light doesn't stay on if the keyboard hasn't been used for few minutes and will turn back on when a button is pressed.  This is a nice battery saving feature.<br />5. Can be connected to 2 different Bluetooth devices.  Switching back and forth is as easy as pushing one of the 2 Bluetooth buttons on the keyboard.  This allowed me to type on 2 different devices without having to disconnect from one device to allow the other to connect.  For example: BT1 -> Android Device, BT2 -> PC.  Depending on which device I wanted to type on, I press the corresponding BT button to autoconnect then just start typing.<br /><br />What Could Be Improved:<br />1.  No angle adjustment.  I prefer more angle to my keyboard when typing.  This has some but not as much as I am accustomed to.  It is definitely better than a laptop keyboard that has no angle at all.<br /><br />Some Things to Note:<br />1. I have the media keys set up as secondary in my laptop's BIOS with the F1-F12 given primary selection.  This keyboard didn't honor those settings and used the media keys as the primary option.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />I like the feel of this keyboard, the size and the colors.

Colors, text, feel, etc are all very personal but to me they're fantastic for the most part.<br /><br />The pics are pretty much spot on for how they look.<br /><br />Feel wise they have a fairly smooth but still some how soft touch to them.  You can very clearly feel the edges but they're not sharp on my fingertips at least.  They have a relatively muted sound when typing too for some reason.  I like that but not everyone will.<br /><br />The lighting through the sides of the keycaps is pretty decent.  There is some minor tint shift going on but its something I have to closely look at while at typing distance to notice so it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />I can't speak to their durability long term but to echo others the outer material is indeed soft compared to other keycaps.  I don't have long fingernails so I don't think it'll be issue for me but it could be for others.  I was able to put a scratch in one with my finger nail by pressing moderately hard on it.<br /><br />All the keycaps are of the proper height and appear to be identical in terms of shape.<br /><br />I have a 96%/1800 style keyboard (Keychron Q5) and this set does indeed fill all the holes size wise.  I did have to put 2 different color keycaps on different rows though (the PAGE UP and HOME keys) which is a minor bummer to me.  But finding a keycap set like this at all for 1800 layout is tough so I was willing to put up with it.  Nothing else out there at the time of this review comes even close looks and feature wise to what this keycap set will for the money.<br /><br />The softness combined with the high-ish price of near $40 at the time of this review are why I knocked a star off.  For that price they should be pretty much perfect in everyway IMO.<br /><br />There are some $100+ keycap sets that appear to be slightly better in terms of durability, lighting tint, and 96%/1800 comparability with similar looks and features to this one floating around the web but that is waay too much for me to justify buying.

8711,5,"Goodbye, Dust! Hello, Electric Dust Mover!","You can't actually say ""Goodbye, Dust"" with an electric dust blower, because it just moves the dust to somewhere else. Fortunately, this Musotica Electric Air Duster offers the option of using a tiny vacuum to scoop it up for proper disposal. But you can say ""goodbye"" to those compressed air dusters in a can with the little plastic straw at the top. The type that gets crazy cold in your hand before you've finished using it.<br />I took the opportunity of looking at other reviews for this product. At least two of them are immensely thorough. What's the saying? They took the words right out of my my mouth.<br />The duster had been partially charged when I received it. I assume it retained a charge after quality control testing. I charged it to full capacity before using it to clean around my electrical equipment, under my keypad (of course), and various other areas around the house that are difficult to access for dusting. This is where a power duster such as this comes in handy, because vacuuming isn't really possible. I tried testing the little vacuum in my car and garage and concluded that it's probably not intended for that; besides, we have other wired vacuums that far more powerful, with a much larger capacity and unlimited running time.<br />I do like the dust blower. Not so much the vacuum, although some potential buyers may have a better use for it than I do.<br />I included a photo of the instruction ""manual,"" front and back, which could definitely be improved by the seller. I also included a photo of the back of the box, which provides some technical information.<br />I know I'll be using this product in the days to come, and I am pleased to have it. At its highest air-blowing  setting, it began to hurt my ears. Obviously, it's not as loud as a leaf blower, but I felt I should warn you if you have sensitive hearing. Wear ear plugs.

678045,2,Defective/Sketchy build quality for the price.,"I've had my pair for maybe 6 months or so. They got regular use, but handled with care. For whatever reason though lately I have a hard time triggering the right side to activate when getting pulled from the charger box and placed on my ear, which has become a more frequent issue with time.<br /><br />Really aggravating when I go out of my way to make sure both sides are on the charger prongs correctly. And often the earbud will be fully charged, but for some reason it simply will not activate on the first attempt out of the box. I don't get it. Pressing the buttons on it won't shock it awake either. Not sure if there's any other way to wake them up besides pulling them from the charger prongs in the charger box, but if that's the case also very annoying.<br /><br />I haven't even used them to work out with (over the ear is better for the noise), so no issue of sweat build up despite them supposedly being sweat resistant. So there's no way they've been damaged by moisture or really anything else.<br /><br />A couple of days ago, they simply refused to do their jobs despite the fact that I knew they were fully charged, and I could hear what sounded like faint static in place of where my music was supposed to be coming from my 4 month old iphone.<br /><br />The sound is just okay. In a lot of noisy environments it feels like it could have more oomph.<br /><br />I think they're relatively comfortable and sturdy for extended wear over the span of a day. Probably the best aspect along with the battery life, which can probably get the average person through an entire day without a charge. Only all-day/heavy listeners would need a charging break. And they charge at a decent speed, although I've never paid close attention. They just always seem ready to go when I need them (well... the battery anyway).<br /><br />Overall, for the price (I got mine when they were indeed $250, ugh) I kinda regret the purchase. Could maybe expect these kind of behaviors after a year and a half of frequent, heavy-handed/careless handling or from a sub $100 set, but just half a year handled with care and they're acting like this... either defective or cheap parts. Be warned.",[],B07WBTX9FH,B0C337TNGS,AFL3O4O22IENUUNLUEUVTHK4ENMA,2023-01-29 05:30:21.648,0,False,496
664728,4,Nice upgrade for older Fire Sticks,"I recently got a new Fire TV Stick 4K that came with one of the new third gen remotes. When I saw this new remote, I really wanted to try it with my older Fire Stick, since it has the extra buttons that I really like. This replacement remote is slightly longer and thicker than the original Amazon remote. A red silicone cover is included that fits perfectly, but it is hard to get on and off, making the changing of batteries a challenge. Every button is the same, except for the bottom 2 streaming services. The new remote has Disney + and Hulu instead of Direct TV and Peacock that is on the original. I actually prefer Disney and Hulu, and the buttons are not programmable, at least not easily. The plastic used in the new remote is not as good as the original, but the fit and finish are good, and there are no sharp corners or misalignments. The batteries go in separate compartments, as opposed to the single compartment in the original.<br />To pair with my Fire Stick, I went into the setup menu and navigated to the Controllers and Bluetooth Devices, Amazon TV Remote, then Add New Remote. From there, I pressed the home button on the new remote for 10 seconds until a yellow LED on the new remote started flashing. The Fire Stick found the new remote, and asked to press the Select button on the old remote to confirm. After that the new remote was connected, and I tried every button, which all worked perfectly. There doesn’t seem to be any lag between the button presses and command execution on the Fire Stick. I also have a Fire TV Recast, so the button to access the guide is a must have. The voice feature also works as advertised, and there are no differences in functionality between the replacement and original remotes. The included cover for the remote is handy, but it does change the feel of the buttons, making them go from raised to sunken. It takes some getting used to, and since it is red, it makes finding the remote somewhat easier.<br />Overall, this is a great replacement for any Fire Stick owner, especially the ones with the older style remotes. It is pricey though, since you can practically get a whole Fire Stick with the remote, like during Prime Day, for what is being charged here. It will not work with the first gen Fire Sticks, so make sure you check before ordering.",[],B0BW8X9BHH,B0BW8X9BHH,AH6L6UD7XFKAUVGQGTXH3QHSJBNA,2023-03-13 22:08:53.460,0,False,496
422948,5,Holy Molyyyyyy!,"For under 50 bux? I don't know how they do it. I consider myself a budget audiophile. I've owned/own countless amps, AVRs, DACs, amps, speakers, subs, etc. I'm always experimenting, swapping EQ and speakers always chasing the perfect sound (to my wife's disdain). When I opened the brown box and saw the Kguss box, my first impression was wow, that's impressive. Well, it didn't stop there.<br />Let me digress and state that I'm using this little beauty connected to my PC via aux port in a nearfield application.<br />Upon opening the Kguss box, I was also impressed with the packing and presentation. The attention to detail is top notch. Build quality is superb. Aluminum body with aluminum KNURLED knobs. The knurling on the knobs is perfect, rougher on the volume, finer on the bass/treble controls. Large rubber feet on the bottom. The power supply is even labeled with the brand. These details add to manufacture cost. Knobs turn smoothly and very nice binding posts on the back.<br />Lets get to the sound. Well, to make a long story short, this thing kicks booty. Highs are airy and bright, mids pack a nice punch and bass is clean and ample. Detail and clarity are remarkable. I was a bit concerned since my previous amps that I was using were connected via optical cable, and going to analog, I was thinking I would lose some fidelity. Boy, was I wrong. Icing on the cake is that this amp is 4ohm stable. Bluetooth connected easily and sounded just as good as analog.<br />The only improvement I could suggest to make this little beast better would be to add a subwoofer pre-out. But no worries, if your subwoofer has high level inputs, then you're golden.<br />Performing an amazon search for Kguss, it looks like, Kguss is a sister company of another VERY highly rated audio company, which then made sense regarding the quality is this amp. Again, for under 50 bux, I don't know how they do it. I have a feeling that once word gets out on these, they will sell out, or the price will go up, so get this while you can at this price.  You will not be sorry.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611fDqYwL9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611fDqYwL9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611fDqYwL9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L+AUKahdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L+AUKahdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L+AUKahdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61T1-ZLLL8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61T1-ZLLL8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61T1-ZLLL8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zALy5jNcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zALy5jNcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zALy5jNcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+IvRLdm9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+IvRLdm9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+IvRLdm9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yi9XJiq4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yi9XJiq4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yi9XJiq4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BDRWNDZK,B0BMT5SD12,AFIPEJWLO34BKCROKOXTQOTHWOIQ,2023-02-20 04:08:54.577,0,False,496

102419,5,"Great headphones, as described.","[[VIDEOID:876c0b51b546ebcd9e5b9c41119649b3]] There headphones are great overall, they function and look as described on the listing.<br /><br />They have all the features typical of this design with two variations: 1) they have physical volume buttons on each headphone, which is nice because you don't have to remember as many cues for the main button, but it is hard to grab the out of the case without pressing the vol buttons.<br /> 2) the case has a USB output so you can actually charge your phone from it, in addition to having the normal USB-C input to charge it with.<br /><br />Other than that, they fit my ear the same way all of the over-ear types do. I have small ears, so they are a little bit big, but they still feel very secure. Also, they come with three sizes of ear cushions, a USB to USB-C cable, and an instruction manual. The smallest ear cushion (is that what they are called?) fit in my ears well, and feels a bit smaller and more comfortable than some other brands I've tried. So when I wore these for a couple of hours my ears didn't hurt which is a great plus.<br /><br />These survived my workout pretty well and seem to handle sweat well, and felt very secure through my jumping and running around. The sound quality is great, they play much louder than other earbuds I have bought before, and the noise cancelling works well.<br /><br />The case shows it's charge and the charge of each headphone when you put them back in it, which is nice. They did position them opposite in the case though, so you have to grab the left ear's earbud out of the right side of the case. This is mildly annoying to me, but other people might not mind it at all. Also, the case itself is bigger than some other brands, possibly because of the USB output, but it has a nice velvety texture that is common and still fits in the pocket of my leggings, so it doesn't bother me at all.<br /><br />So overall, getting them out of the case can feel a little bit clumsy sometimes, but they are great headphones and worth it for the sound quality. Looking forward to more color options!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ADgtQHjAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ADgtQHjAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ADgtQHjAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Zkw6wJJ5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Zkw6wJJ5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Zkw6wJJ5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lz56nNxOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lz56nNxOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lz56nNxOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pDqSqJ7XL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pDqSqJ7XL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pDqSqJ7XL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zHEpnti0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zHEpnti0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zHEpnti0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BNTFQS76,B0BNTFQS76,AGV3LYGYYA7B6POTNUHNCMXSKFFA,2023-02-10 15:34:30.342,15,True,496
98886,5,Excellent for hands-free calling,"Lately I've been on the phone a lot more than I want to be, and I needed a better solution for hands-free calling. I have an assortment of headsets, but they all have issues with mic quality and lack of comfort. With these Ankbit E600 headphones, I've finally found a workable solution.<br /><br />These softly-padded over-the-ear headphones are comfortable, even over my glasses. The cups are a good size for my ears, and present a lower profile than some over-the-ear headphones. The instructions advise taking them off ""every 1-2 hrs to get your ears to relax and protect them from the muggy environment,"" which I do instinctively. It does get ""muggy"" in there.<br /><br />The mic is fantastic! It's the best headset mic I've used. Callers say my voice sounds very natural. It's bendable so I can place it where it captures my voice without being in the way. The only negative thing is that it sometimes picks up surrounding sounds that my phone mic doesn't, like when someone asked if I was filing my nails. (Yes, I was.) I like that the mic is detachable, but I'm careful where I leave it because it's small and easy to lose.<br /><br />I'm not using it for music, so sound-wise all I can judge is how it works for phone calls. The answer is: great! Callers sound natural, like they're in the room with me. Actually, it's better than when they're in the room with me, because the headphones minimize outside noises so all I hear is the voice, without distractions. That's a good thing for aging ears like mine.<br /><br />The Bluetooth paired easily with my Pixel phone (no dongle), and connects quickly when I get a call. The range is good - I can set my phone down and walk anywhere in the house or outside within 40' and still get signal.<br /><br />The battery life is adequate. Using the headphones for a few hours a week brings them down to 80%. The only way I've found to keep tabs on how much juice is left is on my phone's Bluetooth connection message.<br /><br />Small issues like that aside, I'm very happy with these Ankbit Pro Bluetooth headphones for my hands-free calling.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51on+tjlWAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51on+tjlWAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51on+tjlWAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61B7lV+pk8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61B7lV+pk8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61B7lV+pk8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BNQ9HX3T,B0C85QN8GQ,AFO4GY7ZFXW7TYU2DS6NF4XP2CKQ,2023-04-08 20:39:39.440,1,False,496

144071,5,Silly Great NearField Desktop Speakers,"Yes I have these literally 2' to 3' in front of my face at my desk. Mainly because I have no space in my office/bedroom. I'm breaking these in from 50 to 500 hours as some have suggested. What paper cones do, and JBL uses them almost exclusively, is for purity of tone. Why use synthetic but some like that muddy sound for a more relaxing experience. This speaker separates everything and with the air suspension design I think it's more nimble and less boomy bass. It's a rock and roll east coast sound in the bas department however it's well defined like most modern speakers and monitors provide. It's a hybrid old school with a touch of modern refinement.  I wonder because all the original reviews said these were $2,000 retail so why are they all now $2,500? That's a massive jump. I bought mine like new used likely tested and returned but I couldn't tell they had ever been opened. Someone literally stated that without 500 hours of breakin you wouldn't even know how they sound. Well if they get better that's awesome. You have to admit that after a while boomy bass is the most annoying thing on the planet. It's fun for a moment but gets old fast. Accurate bass is really pleasing for hours or listening. Smooth, clean, toneful an accurate. This can do both but it's not going to rattle the windows. I listen to music as I work near my face so my head is almost inside the 10"" cone but also at low volume most of the time. It's really nice but might be even better back about 8'. I probably have the largest desktop speakers in history with these. I only have an Ican pre-amp and main amp Cambridge 80 watts. I can switch to tube inside the Ican if I want a little less clean energy but it seems to prefer clean solid state energy. Many people have commented concerning which amp but I don't have an amp collection. 80 Watts seems to drive it fine. UPDATED: Here's a cool thing I discovered. I order a different KLH grille and you can add additional grilles directly over each other whatever matches the season or decor. So these speakers are toms/guitar/voice brilliant without bloated bass. Put on some Fogerty ""Centerfield"" and sit back and drool.  Sounds like the band is in your room.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612ztSUt7bL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612ztSUt7bL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612ztSUt7bL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61S6igkEy2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61S6igkEy2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61S6igkEy2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sy5O110FL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sy5O110FL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sy5O110FL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B095HYXGDX,B095HYXGDX,AG763WG2HY3FKRDX52XHJT2GG4LQ,2023-02-10 22:12:41.401,1,False,496
334944,5,I love this keyboard A Normal Amount™️,"I was admittedly feeling a bit dubious in getting a foldable keyboard at first, but it has been fantastic! I'll be real honest; I got this lil' baby keyboard so I can write erotica at work without using work machines, and it's been frankly impressive!<br />This keyboard has a fantastic battery life; I haven't had it die on me yet, and I work 11h shifts. The size is very convenient, and since it folds, I don't have to worry about the keys catching on something in my bag and pulling off. The scissor switches feel nice enough. I don't prefer scissor switches in general, so I'm a little biased in that aspect, but they feel like a high quality laptop keyboard. They're pretty quiet as well, which is great.<br />It is real damn sturdy too! I accidentally spilled hot tea on it a couple weeks ago, and I let it air dry for a few days before turning it back on-- it works as if I never doused it in pu'erh! I was so worried the tea would do it in, but this little keyboard keeps on going!!<br />Since it's so much smaller than a standard keyboard, it does take some getting used to when typing on it, but I adjusted pretty quick. I added my iPad & a pen for scale in the photos, and in the background you can see a standard size keyboard for comparison as well.<br />It connects quickly and smoothly to my iPad, Pixel 6a, and Windows desktop with ease. There was one small blip where it wasn't connecting with my iPad after the accidental tea-drowning, but it connected to my other devices just fine, and after forgetting & re-pairing the keyboard, it hasn't had a single issue since. My iPad has had some intermittent connectivity issues as well, so it very well could have been my old iPad acting up instead of the keyboard.<br />My one and only very, *very* minor complaint would be that it goes to sleep pretty quickly-- which I'm sure is great for battery life retention but can be a little annoying when I'm editing and it falls asleep on me often. A quick tap on any key wakes it up immediately though, so like I said, a very insignificant, nitpicky complaint.<br />Overall, it's not flashy, but I've been sincerely impressed by it!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71L16qLhSYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71L16qLhSYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71L16qLhSYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NdPeKizRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NdPeKizRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NdPeKizRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BGN8G6LZ,B0BSCXR2TK,AEG4IVYCTMQBTMACW5OE26WLYAHA,2023-01-02 12:14:57.712,16,True,496
519832,1,Front bezel broke off,"First impression was that this was really well made.<br />Second impression- not so well made.<br />When I tightened the back nut down the front bezel plate came off. The glue that holds it on just wasn't very strong.<br />I returned and opted for a replacement, but the replacement is like a month off for delivery.<br />Will update when I get the replacement.<br /><br />UPDATE: When I put in for a replacement it showed that the replacement was over a month away from delivery, but I needed the part so I had to order it. In the meantime I searched for the same type of part and finally found one that I could get in a few days instead of a month away so I ordered it. There was no option to cancel the replacement so I figured I would return both the original and the replacement when it got here. Shouldn't be a problem, right? The original was to be returned to Whole Foods so the replacement was going to go to the same place, right?  Nope.<br />The replacement came in a week earlier than expected so I submitted for a return. I had already set up for the original to be returned to Whole Foods, but Amazon wanted the replacement to be returned to a UPS drop off center which meant that I would have to drive across town to a UPS drop off center, then drive to a whole foods which isn't near a drop off center to return this part. What a pain. Called Amazon and, even though these were from the exact same place, Amazon wouldn't budge on the return. Had a very long discussion and waited on hold but Amazon decided that it was better to have a UPS driver come out and pick up the part (sometime within the week but not a definite day or time because UPS doesn't do that) instead of letting me take both parts (that are being returned to the same people at the same place) to Whole Foods.<br />So, overall, the replacement does look like it would have worked but I decided to not leave my truck dismantled for weeks on end and found a better option. I wish I could have used this in a different project to avoid the hastle, but it is what it is. Wish Amazon would have let me return it to Whole Foods, then this would have been easily completed. Now I have to put this out on my porch each day and hope UPS comes to pick it up.",[],B0BLGRFK1Y,B0BLGRFK1Y,AG3VIRX72AXQ3T2UGCHB5H4MVIJQ,2023-02-26 15:49:00.957,1,True,496
738304,3,An interesting product,"An interesting product, so I gave a try since the price would be ok if it works as advertised. Actually, I like it and it does the job advertised. it boots up faster than expected, connect and tied well with my phone using apple car play. didn't notice any audio delay and Netflix, youTube, etc.. all good but becomes unstable time to time. Maybe this is only for my own experiences but a few problems I encountered are...<br />1. comes with a manual but not user-friendly at all. However, there are good YouTube reviews explaining how to xxx like mirroring your phone, split screen, app icon arrangement, even language and time format settings.<br />2. no gps signal from built-in waze/google map. sometimes waze app got stuck with this message even in downtown LA area. After changing GPS from BOX to Car, it's still happening but less than BOX setting. Also randomly stuck at updating traffic info xx% frequently. If changed to apple carplay, it just works.<br />3. forced switching between Wi-Fi hotspot and cellphone connection while using built in AA and ACP. initially I thought this was broken feature but only one connection is allowed unless you use network sim card with the box.<br />4. some of built-in APP like netflix is not updatable through google playstore; I believe OTTOCast advertised like you can install any app from app store. hmm... OTTOCAST support said the box needs to be factory-reset when the built-in app needs to be reinstalled/refreshed. Not sure if this applies to all built-in apps or just some of them.<br />5. Apps freeze intermittently when switching one from the others in split screen mode. Hopefully this will be fixed either my replacement or next firmware update if there's any.<br /><br />Anyway, the problems still happen after recommended factory reset, so I requested a replacement through amazon. Why didn't I just go with return? Hmm, I still like its features. But if my replacement has the same problems, I don't think that is fair for its price tag. one more thing, after factory reset you will see an message liek 'Device not activated'.

848892,5,"small size, adequate cooling","Two 120mm fans will only push as much air as 2 120mm fans, and these aren't amazing fans to begin with.  most laptop coolers just stuff more fans in, but the LIENS doesn't have that luxury--at half the cost of other coolers and the form factor of a chubby 14-inch laptop, a lot of sacrifices had to be made.  considering this, is it still a compelling product?  Yes.<br /><br />I bought one of these years ago to cool the infamously spicy Razer Blade 15.  I wanted something cheap and small enough to fit in a backpack with the laptop for travel.  The LIENS has survived 3 Razers now and continues to do its job well.<br />Cooling is adequate.  It never prevented throttling but roughly tripled the time it took for each laptop to heat soak, enough for top-level performance in a short gaming session.  During sustained productivity loads, the LIENS was able to keep up with each laptop's i7--without it, they would eventually throttle.<br />Noise has been minimal.  these aren't silent fans but they're quieter than many laptop fans, and I can't imagine most people having an issue with them.  there's a moderate amount of soft blue lighting on the chasse that can be turned down with a scroll wheel, but as far as RGB goes, it's pretty unobtrusive.<br />Durability has been a bit of an issue.  the manufacturing was fine, especially at this price point, but the plastic used is simply not as strong as my partner's foot.  the LIENS uses a U-shaped foot with a metal prop, but the foot is particularly thin.  on one occasion, the foot snapped in the middle and on another, the pegs that hold the foot to the chasse sheared off on one side.  in both cases I was able to repair it with superglue, but this simply isn't a product you can beat up.  Outside of that, nothing has gone wrong.<br /><br />The cost is minimal, cooling is good enough for most uses, and durability is just adequate.  if you need a no-nonsense cooler for a small laptop but don't want to spend much or haul around one of the RGB monstrosities that are larger then 17in laptops, the LIENS has you covered.",[],B08SW4RWWQ,B0BXJGSZ8W,AHC7W6CZ7Z7V5YYEXAEBX3S34B2Q,2023-01-30 06:32:13.377,0,False,496
887621,5,Installed without a hitch and bumped up my wifi speeds,"Quick background, I used this on an ancient 12 year old Windows 7 machine with USB 2.0 ports -- this is a machine so old it doesn't even have the ability to recognize 5GHz signals. Wifi speeds on this relic hovered around 4 mbps up and down -- SLOWWWW -- when my phone hits over 300 mbps right next to it. On the bright side, my ancient PC....being as old as it is....has a CD to install the TP-Link driver software, which I think would be a big problem for using these external wifi adapters on newer machines. Who has a CD drive anymore?<br /><br />I tried this and the slightly less expensive TP-Link AC1300 USB WiFi Adapter(Archer T3U). This one gives about 80 mbps down and 20 mbps up, and the less expensive T3U gave about 50 down and 15-18 mbps up. For the nominal extra cost, I went with this one.<br /><br />So, what to make of this. On the one hand, the speeds with these wifi adapters are nowhere close to what's being pumped out. However, the fault is almost certainly the creaky USB 2.0 and not the adapters, which are still yielding vastly faster connections than I had before.<br /><br />Again, installation was a breeze that took all of 3 minutes -- I hooked up the adapter, popped in the CD, ran the driver, and voila. Actually, one additional step I did that you'll probably also have to, I went into the device driver and disabled the internal wifi card or the system would have continued defaulting to that. So, add another minute -- 4 minutes total. Easy. So far, connections have been stable.<br /><br />If space is an issue you might go with the T3U, the performance difference.... at least on my system.... was negligible. But when your speeds are as slow as mine, any increase is worth it.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I don't know why because I have changed no settings anywhere, but download speeds have consistently increased to about 200 mbps down and 30-40 mbps up. Also worth noting is that wifi connects instantly when PC wakes up from sleep mode. All in all, very pleased -- zero glitches, fast speeds given the limits of my system, painless install.

640716,4,Great monitor with some headaches,"pros: As responsive as IPS can get (for now), good colors, decent HDR, bright, the only 1440p 360 hz monitor (for now), overall good build quality, nvidia reflex latency analyzer and dedicated g-sync module<br /><br />cons: Price, strange bugs, gamer design on the back is lame. 360hz is great, but you really need to look at the games you play to figure out if you can utilize it.<br /><br />Reasons I bought this monitor: I was upgrading from the first rog swift (pg278q). I considered the M27Q-X which is 1440p 240hz but those are mostly out of stock at the moment and the only options were used with inflated prices. I considered the pg27aqdm, but OLED burn in is a deal breaker for me considering I will also be working on this computer and many of the games I play have static huds that will 100% burn in less than a year. The Alienware 27 AW2721D was another consideration, but I really despised the outward appearance of the monitor. Finally considered the Neo g8 odyssey for $200 more, but I would rather have 360hz 1440p than 240hz 4k personally, and the g8 has even more reported bugs and issues.<br /><br />That being said, this monitor does have bugs too. I've gotten it stable again so far, but turning on HDR in games or on windows sometimes makes the monitor turn off and on again occasionally. I experience this maybe once every couple of hours at most, but if HDR is off it never happens at all. Another strange bug happened with HDR when windows turned off the monitor due to inactivity, and when I came back the screen was stuck extremely dim. No settings I changed while it was dim could fix it, but unplugging and replugging the power brick fixed it. Once again, this has only happened once so far and it was when HDR was on. Others have also said disabling G-Sync will fix this problem. As far as I can tell from my research and what others have discussed, it is ""an issue with Nvidia's display engine which struggles with DSC"".<br />Overall, your mileage may vary. I have no dead pixels, very little backlight bleed and fairly limited bugs. I would say its otherwise perfect with some driver updates and a price decrease.",[],B0BHK7LLZD,B0BHK7LLZD,AHZWON5WMR2HOE6A64PZHQNN44RQ,2023-05-10 16:41:09.100,0,True,496
897726,5,Great way to start your child out with a smart watch,"My daughter has been asking me for both a smartwatch and a phone since she was 6 - she's 9 now. I wanted to make sure she was ready for having something like that, so seeing this watch, I decided to get it for her. This is a great way to start your child out with the responsibility of having a device like this. She would lose her head if it wasn't attached, so getting her a smartphone wouldn't be something she could handle at the moment, but having a watch that is attached to her wrist, could give her the practice she would need to keep track of what she has and, hopefully, help her become prepared for a phone. I got the one that wasn't data ready. The other option would allow you to get a sim card for $6/month to allow for texting and calling features.<br /><br />Without having the calling and texting features, this little thing still packs a good punch with what it has to offer. There are games, a camera with filter options and the ability to take a selfie or take a picture with the lens that is on the side of the watch, a video feature that does the same as the camera, ability to add and listen to music, an alarm, a flashlight, calculator, and a calendar as well. It's very similar to having a smartwatch that you'd purchase as an adult. The only thing that bothered my kid was the band made her wrist itch, but that's due to the metal of the clasp on the band. I fixed that up for her and she was good to go. If your child is sensitive to metals, you can use clear nail polish and it'll act as a barrier between the metal and the skin. The battery life is contingent upon how often your child plays with the different features. If they're on the games a lot, listen to music, taking pictures/videos, etc., then the battery will last about 6-ish hours. I charge hers every night and it's ready to go in the morning.<br /><br />For the price, you get quite a bit, especially with the calling and texting features. For $6/month, that isn't a bad deal at all. Overall, this is a great starter smartwatch and it's at a great price. Sure beats the $100+ watches that aren't too kid friendly and may not have all the features that are offered like this one.",[],B0BQHD5C1N,B0BP14FP1G,AGDO26DWUQEIFKVWJPFGKXB4BP2Q,2023-04-14 16:21:15.741,0,False,496
62447,4,Alterative to a raspberry pi pc,"With the shortage of inexpensive computer options these days ie. Raspbetry Pi's . This comes in as a decent alternative with more potential.<br /><br />PC seems well built it's compact and small enough to stash on a desk or use the supplied bracket to mount on the back of a monitor. It doesn't have alot for ports, which makes sense for the size. Has 2 usb ports on the front with the power and the rest 2 hdmi, 2 usb, power and audio out back. I do wish that it had at least one usb c since more devices are moving this standard.<br /><br />Performance is ok and expected for this price range, it's on the lighter side of specs with minimal ram (8gb) and hard drive (256gb) which makes this ok for the basics. I could see this being an ok for a family pc if it's shared for basic stuff. The nice thing is that when you take the bottom panel off, you do have the option to swap out hard drive and ram so you can swap for something larger or faster down the road. It has an additional m2 sata slot so but no documentation on it but like that there is option to add some space.<br /><br />While using it and running updates it seemed responsive maybe not as smooth as a higher end pc but something you won't really notice unless you've had a faster pc. I can see over time this needing a good wipe of the OS as Windows typically does. It does have a fan that tends to want to kick in at random and often, it's not loud almost not noticeable. But the fan profile could use some tuning.<br /><br />As for the raspberry pi statement. With shortage of cheap pc alternatives and scalping that is on going. For a lil bit more this offer more potential and a full fledge OS.<br /><br />Overall this is a good inexpensive pc option. If you plan to play video games or more resource intensive programs I would say this probably isn't the best option for that purpose. But if your going for a basics machine or something to have as a research pc in a hobby room or shop this would work great. I'll be swapping out my raspberry pi I currently am using to run Home Assistant with this pc as it allows me to do some other times I plan on doing. And freeing up my raspberry pi for fun projects.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jz3SnBNML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jz3SnBNML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jz3SnBNML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71u4bRsaWiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71u4bRsaWiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71u4bRsaWiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/819prlkt5pL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/819prlkt5pL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/819prlkt5pL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81R5IP+AHjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81R5IP+AHjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81R5IP+AHjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BRB2SHCF,B0C36JK4BG,AFG3QSJ6V2DPTXU6P2ASFAB6UHBA,2023-03-09 08:37:43.814,0,False,496
711205,5,All the basic features in a well made easy to use Walkie Talkie!,"I got a set to use for communication between our home and a lake about a mile away. It's much easier and more convenient to use walkie talkies than a mobile phone. It's also less painful if stolen while swimming. This set works extremely well for the application. It has all of the basic featuress and adequate range. The basic functions are effective and extremely easy to use. It has the full range of 22 FRS channels and provides for secure call alerts and multiple call tones. The scan feature works well and I like the fact that while scanning you have the ability to instantly change scan direction using the channel up/down buttons. Sound is clear and volume range is more than adequate for outdoor use. The battery can be charged using the AC power supply provided or via a USB-C cable that plugs into the housing. For my application the battery lasts all day (it's mostly in standby). i keep the walkie talkies in the charger when not in use so I'm not certain how long the battery will last on a single charge. The walkie talkies seem well made and durable<br /><br />As you might expect at such a low price, there are limitations with certain features. For example, Squelch is automatic and not adjustable. There is a monitor button that turns off squech completely while pressed. The weather radio feature is nice, supporting 11 channels. However, I found that reception was a bit spotty and extremely sensitive to antenna orientation. Keeping the monitor button pressed while listening to weather reports does resolve the problem. I also found the weather channel scan feature was extremely difficult to use effectively. It did not stop at active weather channels. You need to press scan at exactly the right time to get it to stop at a desired channel. There doesn't seem to be any way to manually scroll through or select a particular channel.  Once you've found a preferred channel and are able to tune to it, there is a memory function so you can return to that channel at any time. It would have been nice to have the Channel Up and Channel Down buttons enable you to select a weather channel but those two buttons are inoperative when listening to weather channels.<br /><br />In summary, if you're looking for a basic, reasonably priced, well built and durable form of communication, I believe this is a great choice. Nothing fancy, no frills, just reliable and easy so use.",[],B0BPGJ7CK4,B0BTHQL9BN,AH2HE4EP7SSWXHML6I5A5VD723AA,2023-01-25 05:38:05.883,0,False,496

140005,4,Sufficiently cools Pixelbook,"Granted my i7 Pixelbook is several years old since it was released in 2017 but I still really enjoy using it and it's still up to the task so until that changes I'll continue keeping it in rotation however one thing that always bothered me was how hot it runs. It's borderline too hot to even touch for more than a second or two without any kind of cooling however this item drastically improves this situation to the point where it's almost not even warm. Granted I modified it slightly so that it sits up higher and isn't sitting flush on top of the fans which I believe helps improve circulation but the end result is nothing short of impressive. The only reason I deducted one star is that my unit came without any kind of power switch and it's very difficult to turn on and off with some sort of crude instrument but if that can be addressed I would gladly change my rating to five stars. To be perfectly honest I may do so anyway because this is such a drastic improvement. I also very much like the aesthetic and the LED lighting is quite nice and much more varied in terms of the RGB output as compared to most of my RGB devices. The other thing that I would have liked to have seen is even a small amount of inability to change the angle but as it's stands and its current form it is completely fixed with zero ability to make any adjustments unless you change the surface that you place it on but this is not always able to be done. Also because of the aforementioned lack of a power switch in the event that My pixelbook is not sitting on the stand the fan slots are pretty exposed and could easily be damaged by something entering into the fan housing area and coming into contact with a fan that's in motion so you really need to be cognizant of that as I would imagine the moment any one of the fans becomes compromised the entire unit would be unusable since if you ever had a fan blade break off of any kind of fan be a PC cooling fan or otherwise you know that it's essentially useless from that point forward and any attempts to fix it only potentially make the situation worse. Most of these besides I mentioned only for the benefit of the manufacturer in case they want to improve the products for future release / updates but I am very happy with it even in its current form without a power switch.

455372,2,"Technically functional, but not what I'd want in a real emegency","The radio works and I can get reception on two NOAA stations and a bare handful of FM. But the features are all just not great. I'd rather have an emergency radio with one or two really functional backup power sources than several that are awful.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It powers on reliably and it does in fact receive weather, SW, FM, and AM. Not well, but I can get a few stations.<br />- The lights work.<br />- It can use AA batteries. Which is good since the other power options are terrible.<br />- The micro USB port means I can charge it off a power bank. Which I'll likely be doing constantly if I don't have AA batteries available.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The lights are barrely worth using. I mean, I have tiny pen lights running on a single AAA that put out more light.<br />- The solar charger is garbage. It's terrible. I need to hold it up nearly touching a 65 watt flood light before it indicates it's charging at all. Taking it outside on anything but a bright sunny day will be unlikely to get you any real power. How many emergency or disaster scenarios are accompanied by bright sunny days?<br />- The hand crank is horrible and flimsy. It does charge, but it feels like the handle is going to snap off during each rotation and you literally get fewer minutes of use than you've put in minutes of cranking.<br />- The built-in battery is TINY. It's 600 mah. I tried leaving the radio running on low volume and only got maybe two hours out of it. In a real emergency you'll likely want your radio to last more than two hours.<br />- The battery drains almost as fast in NOAA Alert mode as it does in normal operation. Tried it, got just under 3 hours before it died. I thought the alert mode was supposed to conserve power and only kick on if an alert went out. This maybe saves a bit, but not enough to be truly useful.<br /><br />Overall this is just a toy product that pretends it can do lots of things, but does them all so poorly it's not worth buying. Get yourself a decent rechargable radio with weather functions and a separate power bank with a solar panel on it. That'll be WAY more functional than this thing.",[],B003A21DQA,B00E0ISVLI,AEXWHSWTSPOPIY5GA2447BKZBSNQ,2023-01-17 21:50:45.455,6,True,496
449080,4,decent air blower/vaccum,"It's not bad. it can be just annoying to use. and the attachments are not the greatest.<br /><br />First starting with the positives, its can do a lot of things but it just can't do a lot well. I bought this mainly for cleaning my office and my computer from all the dust that is around in my house. and with all the attachments it was able to get the job done.<br /><br />Now the things I don't like, first is theirs to many attachments and none of them a great at picking up a single layer of dust, you would think that the tip with the brush on it would work great until you find out that the suction power is reduced a lot once it gets past all those long bristle so all you doing is pushing the dirt.<br /><br />For the first time if you want to vacuum with it then you will be confused and the instructions are not to clear but there's this plastic cover that get pulled off on the back by 1/4 twist counter clock wise and then you put the vacuum filter on it. All that you are doing is basically operating it backwards and adding a replaceable filter.<br /><br />I do like the filter unlike other hand vacuums it has a aluminum shell around the filter so bigger particles are stopped. This increase's the life of the filter, but this also kills its efficiency at moving air and makes a restriction inside of it.<br /><br />I will have to say this is more of an air blower does have design flaws. Like when operating in vacuum mode the air will sometimes blow right to your face. That was driving me nuts.<br /><br />I do wish that the speed control was a dedicated switch instead of throught quick button/trigger presses so there's less confusion and/or put lights on the back to show speed and battery information.<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br />It's not bad blower but its defiantly not a good vacuum. this 2 in one didn't hit all the needs as well as I wanted it will still get the job done but I feel like I could get it done faster if I just had the right attachments and if I wasn't getting blown on by the other side. but for a vacuum I don't recommend it but as a blower it isn't bad not as good as compressed air but can get a lot accomplished.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613obm6+MwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613obm6+MwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613obm6+MwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Mtj54WtfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Mtj54WtfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Mtj54WtfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61czMnjpVZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61czMnjpVZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61czMnjpVZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qwS8UwmWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qwS8UwmWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qwS8UwmWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TmnXAtBcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TmnXAtBcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TmnXAtBcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XqZK5xyHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XqZK5xyHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XqZK5xyHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BM9MRT6N,B0BM9MRT6N,AENUVRZ4RMQXSTHCX3YFNMETGZZQ,2023-01-31 11:53:17.219,4,False,496
213138,5,Great for Watchmaking,"This microscope exceeded my expectations, especially given the price. I picked up watchmaking as a hobby and was really struggling with loupes/magnifiers. When I saw that affordable digital microscopes were available, I did a bit of research. I ended up choosing this one in particular because it solves the issue most of these cheaper microscopes seem to have. That is, most do not allow you to move the camera far enough away to see the entire object. By lengthening the rail the camera rides on, this microscope is much more useful for my purposes.<br />As far as the features go, I've been getting a lot of use from the photo/video function. Basically, I record the disassembly of the watch movement. This gives me something to reference in the event I forget how to put it back together. That's been extremely useful while learning the hobby. Beyond that, there are a lot of settings and such for the camera (contrast, sharpness, etc.) but the defaults have worked well enough so far.<br />In my opinion, the only cons are the built in lights and charging time. The base has two lights built in, with their brightness controlled by a touch bar thing. In order to use them, you have to run an included cable from the screen unit into the base (because the battery is in the screen unit). The issue I have is that I kept activating the touch pad by accident. And, for whatever reason, the lights make an electric humming sound (but only when the brightness is set lower than full, which is weird). I ended up just leaving the base unplugged, because I didn't find it worth the trouble. The other built-in light is a ring light around the lens. This one works fairly well and has four brightness levels (or completely off). A minor problem is that the lights can sometimes be seen on reflective metal parts, but it's not a big deal. For some reason, they included a plastic doo-hickey you can install to completely cover the light. I'm not really sure why since you can just turn the light off. Finally, it takes quite awhile to full charge.<br />Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase. This scope makes examining parts very simple and a lot more comfortable (as compared to hunching over with a loupe). So, I would definitely recommend this to watchmakers or other hobbyists.",[],B0BG44LQR7,B0C46ZCBTN,AFJLJKP23UNZCT575JNRCGK53Y2A,2023-04-23 05:56:54.830,2,True,496
839605,5,superior music delivery device,"I own about a half dozen Mp3 players and this one is the priciest.<br />Compact (about 2 X 4 in.) and comprised of a metal housing, it weighs a little less than my Samsung Galaxy phone. It fits comfortably into shirt or pants pocket.  Navigation is very simple with various icons displayed on the full-touch screen.  There is a jack for connecting to phones (not provided) or to an external speaker via an Aux cable (not included).  Bluetooth pairing is easy, and I was especially glad to link effortlessly to my wireless earbuds. Works well in the car using either Bluetooth or cable.<br />Sound quality is excellent.  There is an equalizer feature that adjusts to music genre, although I’m not convinced that this makes much difference.  I play exclusively opera, orchestral and chamber music, and lots of piano recitals, so I chose the “classical” equalizer option.  No problems.  When the device is linked to my good Bose speaker, the sound, to my ears, is slightly better than that produced by any of my less expensive players. Similarly outstanding results when using high quality headphones.<br />Comes with 32 gigs of capacity, with the ability to add a TF card (not included).  I loaded it with a bunch of full-length operas and there was still lots of room left for more.  There is also an Ebook function that produces good readable text.<br />Oddly enough, the H2 lacks many of the features available from some of the cheaper competition.  There is no FM radio connection, no speaker on the device and no WiFi access to things like You-tube or Amazon Music.  Admittedly, many Mp3 players lack some or all of these things, but there are those that do indeed come “fully loaded.”<br />A modest instruction sheet included in the box with directions for accessing online a full user manual.  Admirable customer service—I did not get the small velvet carrying bag that should have been included in the package.  When I wrote to inquire about this, I got an apology and a free upgraded carrying case—no questions asked!<br />Overall, a very good player but not inexpensive.

I tested a 25 GB and 100 GB discs with this unit and I found that it detected them properly. The suite is very user friendly too. I used the Cyberlink Desktop Burning Gadget application the most. This was super simple to use. All you do is you drag/drop the files you want to back up and rename the disc. Once you are happy with the contents of said disk, you select burn. I was able to create 20+ GB discs very quickly. As you can imagine, the 100 GB discs did take longer to create, but finished and worked well afterwards when tested.<br /><br />I also enjoyed how quiet this burner is compared to some others ones I have owned in the past. It's never going to be whiper quiet, but I was pleasantly surprised how quiet this burner performed. I like that it has a matté finished in the outer door of this unit. This burner is super light and can easily been thrown into messenger bag or your backpack of choice.<br /><br /> I guess if I had to nit pick, I would have loved to have received longer USB cables [the included ones are short] and the Cyberlink programs do annoyingly solicit at you. Their apps will constanly offer discounts towards upgrade to their newest version. It does not hinder the process, but I wish you could turn this off. The Cyberlink suite is super comprehensive though. You get everything you could possibly want from a media creation standpoint, from video files /data files /label creation /image /video editing and much more.<br /><br />If you are looking for a reliable burner for home or on the go, then look no further and check out already!<br /><br />I hope this was helpful!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vMeOS+oEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vMeOS+oEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vMeOS+oEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81uUhYRV01L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81uUhYRV01L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81uUhYRV01L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BN65PZS9,B0BN65PZS9,AHNH3XTW5G2EIBAVMFAIDOR7OYDA,2023-01-28 21:34:54.202,1,False,496
296553,1,Has Android 12 installed but it is SLOW.  PAINFULLY SLOW.  I CAN’T BROWSE THE INTERNET SLOW.,"2Q]\<br /><br />I will admit that I didn’t expect a lot from this tablet.  At this price point, it would be much more surprising to get a good tablet than a bad one.  So what is good about it?  It looks nice.  The bezels are small, it is similar in thickness to an older iPad.  It feels like a pretty decent tablet in your hand.  But that is before you turn it on and try to use it.  It is painfully slow.  I had expected it to be useable for surfing the web.  At this point I will say it is not.  I have 5 year old tablets that are smoother scrolling than this one.  It struggles to load a common news website.  There is a terrible lag when scrolling an article.  When you go back, the screen blanks for what seems like an eternity.<br /><br />It does have the Google Play store installed and I was able to download an app from the store and install it.  I downloaded the Amazon Blink app for use with their Blink cameras.  The app works but there is so little headroom that when looking at a live view, the sound cuts in and out constantly.  At this point I would say that I can’t really imagine a credible use case for this tablet.  Maybe if you have a small child and you want to give them a tablet but you don’t really care how well it works, maybe then.  But if you have to load the apps on it or help them with anything, you will be regretting your choice soon.  I really can’t envision a scenario where I would say this is good enough for any particular task.<br /><br />Other important tidbits:  It seems to say in the details that it works with both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi.  It does not as best I can tell.  I have dual band Wi-Fi router in my home.  Only the 2.4 GHz band shows up as available networks.  Another nagging little issue is that you cannot tap the screen to wake up the tablet.  You have to press the lock key to wake up the tablet.  Overall, my experience with this tablet is completely sub-par.  Keep looking, this is not the tablet you are looking for.",[],B0BQ22H1QR,B0BQ22H1QR,AFSU7NSWV6R3A24RGLA3AYVN7GHQ,2023-02-28 03:10:50.585,1,False,496

I wanted a quality keyboard for everyday use.<br /><br />I have been using this keyboard for several months and am very impressed!  The keyboard is very slim with a low profile.  That said, it is still a full-sized keyboard.  This is perfect for my use case.  I'm super happy with it!<br /><br />This device works with either 2.4 GHz (with a dongle) or Bluetooth.  It can also easily switch between multiple devices using Bluetooth with the press of a button.  I use this with various devices frequently, so easy switching with no hassles is very lovely.  It has worked flawlessly.<br /><br />The keyboard is extremely quiet.  The keys feel like they have a very soft click.  I was looking for a quiet keyboard as my office is quiet and my old keyboard was very loud.  This one did the trick!  It is almost silent, yet still has a light, tactile click feeling when typing.  It's just enough to feel confident and type quickly without noise.<br /><br />It has a nice tray for holding phones and tablets, which works well.  I tested it with multiple devices.  Depending on the thickness, some devices fit better than others, but all worked with the device.  I have one cellphone with a thick case that didn't fit the best.  Taking the case off fixes the problem but is a hassle.  That said, it's super nice for smaller phones since they don't flop around as much.<br /><br />I could switch between my Mac and Windows laptops just by pressing the command key.  The keyboard switched, and I could use ""the other"" laptop.  It's effortless to operate.<br /><br />I love that the keyboard is full-width.  I use this with a portable PC most of the time and have room to store it in my bag.  It's a great option I prefer over lugging a heavy keyboard around.

772601,4,Pretty OK large capacity SSD drive for storage,"I've been waiting for large-capacity SSDs to come down in price for a long time. I saw this 2TB for $60 on sale and figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I'm looking to replace my RAID of spinning disks in my my long-term home storage with a few SSDs. In theory, if you primarily read from them, SSDs should last an extremely long time - even QLC drives like this one. This should make them perfect for long term archival storage with few writes. and lots of reads. And since they shouldn't fail ever year or two like mechanical drives, they won't need to be in a RAID, which means I won't need to buy twice as much storage as I need either.<br /><br />I'm testing this one out as my media drive and using it to store my movie collection.<br /><br />- The drive isn't screaming fast like the more expensive drives. However, the read speed has been consistently ""fast enough.""<br /><br />- Writes are fast, until they're not. Once its internal cache fills up, the drive's write falls pretty fast. Sustained write performance can drop to 10 MB/s or less. This is a bit frustrating when I'm filling up a new archival drive - 1 TB all at once is likely the worst-case workload for write performance. But now that I've done that, I don't notice write problems much. I also think I'd probably notice less if I were writing smaller files.<br /><br />I've been using the drive for about 3 months now. While I wouldn't recommend this as the boot drive on a high end gaming system or developer workstation, I think it would be great in a game console, in a media server, for archival storage, or even as the boot drive in a typical home user's PC or laptop.<br /><br />Quibble:<br /><br />Two of the threaded screw holes for mounting the drive from below weren't machined correctly. The screws only go in about half as far as they should. My drive trays mount from below, and two of the screws didn't sit flush with the tray, which made the tray not fit in my drive enclosure.

In the meantime I searched for the same type of part and finally found one that I could get in a few days instead of a month away so I ordered it. There was no option to cancel the replacement so I figured I would return both the original and the replacement when it got here. Shouldn't be a problem, right? The original was to be returned to Whole Foods so the replacement was going to go to the same place, right?  Nope.<br />The replacement came in a week earlier than expected so I submitted for a return. I had already set up for the original to be returned to Whole Foods, but Amazon wanted the replacement to be returned to a UPS drop off center which meant that I would have to drive across town to a UPS drop off center, then drive to a whole foods which isn't near a drop off center to return this part. What a pain. Called Amazon and, even though these were from the exact same place, Amazon wouldn't budge on the return. Had a very long discussion and waited on hold but Amazon decided that it was better to have a UPS driver come out and pick up the part (sometime within the week but not a definite day or time because UPS doesn't do that) instead of letting me take both parts (that are being returned to the same people at the same place) to Whole Foods.<br />So, overall, the replacement does look like it would have worked but I decided to not leave my truck dismantled for weeks on end and found a better option. I wish I could have used this in a different project to avoid the hastle, but it is what it is. Wish Amazon would have let me return it to Whole Foods, then this would have been easily completed.

310182,4,"Great remote, but lots of room for improvement","I started using my Nvidia Shield (2017) and I got reminded how much I don't like using the original remote it came with. So when I saw this listed, it was interested by the fact it was advertised that you can use it as a mouse by waving it. So I ordered it just for that.<br /><br />This remote is pretty basic. It comes with two different ways to connect to your supported device: the USB receiver or Bluetooth 5.0. Since I got this for using with my Nvidia Shield, I was able to try both options. The USB receiver works as intended, but there must be a line of sight from the remote to the receiver even though I'm not that far away from my Shield. I ended up pulling out a USB extension cable and it seems to work fine. The only thing is that the mic for using voice commands does not work when using the USB receiver. It only works in Bluetooth mode. Speaking of which, the bluetooth mode works really good. Once I paired it with the Shield, it works instantly. The mic works for one thing and it works pretty good. However the one issue I have is trying to wake up the Shield over Bluetooth hours later. It doesn't work unless you tell it to enter 'repairing' mode by holding 'OK' and the 'Return' keys and only then it connects over Bluetooth again. This doesn't seem to happen when using USB, but I really wish this wasn't so bad because I perfer to use it over Bluetooth.<br /><br />As for the mouse pointer, it works great! You push the button to activate it and it feels very smooth. I would compare this to using the cursor on the LG TVs with their magic remote. They both feel the same! You are also able to adjust the speed of the cursor to your liking.<br /><br />The only other thing I hate is that if you choose to use bluetooth, there is no spot in the remote to store your USB receiver (see picture). When you open the box, the receiver is stored in the battery compartment. But when you put your batteries in it, you no longer have a spot for it. I wish  they made some room in the remote so I won't lose the receiver.<br /><br />I perfer using this remote over the original Shield remote and I'm hoping that there will be a new revision of this soon.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YzFhiVvLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YzFhiVvLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YzFhiVvLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BNH17D18,B0BNH17D18,AFNPNYV5HXGHP65I24LXKA6525BA,2023-01-12 22:45:03.958,2,False,496

I use them as a headset for meetings/calls as well as listening to music/podcasts, I even occasionally wear them while sleeping. I also normally have them connected to 2 devices at the same time. In other words, I'm a very heavy user. I have also had older versions of this same MPOWS headset in the past that I have loved. In my opinion this new version is a step backwards, the biggest issue is that it disconnects from my devices by itself if left in standby for a while.  Its very annoying because you need to cycle power by long-pressing a button to turn it off then long-press the button again to turn it back on. This has caused me to miss phone calls.<br />In addition, the audio clue (beep) has been eliminated when the pause/reconnect button is pressed. This makes it impossible to tell if the power is on or off while wearing them without actually cycling power. I would still buy them again but I really miss the older versions of this headset, they were the best bargain out there.

591795,4,Very good video resolution,"I have a blind spot where there is no power available. This should solve that problem. For now, I have it mounted next to a wired camera to test it before installing permanently.  So far, I am impressed with its functioning. After three days, the camera has functioned 24/7 on Solar only and, the battery consumption is good.<br /><br />Installation and linking to my WIFI was easy but, you will need their proprietary, separate app. When I tried to link to ""Alexa"" it requires you to download an Alexa Skill. this App was ""funky"". At one point, trying to put in my credentials, It would not accept them. With frustration, I deleted the app and thought I would have to use the camera app only. However, on a whim I asked ALEXA to show me Solar Cam and it does it.<br /><br />So far I have not found a way to store 24/7 recording on the SD card but, it does store all ALERTS of detected motion selectable from 6 seconds to 30 seconds (longer recording will drain battery more)<br /><br />While I am not a fan of some unknown cloud service but, it does allow you 6 second video of all alerts for up to 7 days. If you want longer videos stored it costs 2.99/month and, it also costs to get AI, which distinguishes between human, animals and vehicles. But it does a very good job of motion detection.<br /><br />Pro: very good build, worked all night on power charge provided by solar panel. Good picture and video quality with less than a second delay when viewing on App. included are screen shots from this camera and my wired camera. Ability to set/restrict areas of the picture that will detect motion to specific area.<br /><br />Cons. While the price point for a product is an individual decision, this is a little pricey (IMO) compared to other similar products available. The speaker is not very loud and, is a bit muffled but, the microphone is very clear and loud for recording/listening to outside noise with about a one second delay. While it does link to ALEXA, it will not link to ""Tiny CAM"" which I use to monitor multiple installed cameras.<br /><br />overall, though, I am happy with this Solar camera.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41g3d7x1pML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41g3d7x1pML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41g3d7x1pML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614s9tGeaxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614s9tGeaxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614s9tGeaxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7183RfsompL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7183RfsompL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7183RfsompL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71g--6g+fBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71g--6g+fBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71g--6g+fBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71h0fnoLvSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71h0fnoLvSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71h0fnoLvSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kyw9Kj9XL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kyw9Kj9XL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kyw9Kj9XL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tYPj8yfOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tYPj8yfOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tYPj8yfOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zTiwxP-VL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zTiwxP-VL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zTiwxP-VL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/810-86d+5vL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/810-86d+5vL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/810-86d+5vL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81byYR4oj-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81byYR4oj-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81byYR4oj-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BQXJ2MPB,B0CBLRHZXM,AFU4SPY4T6Y3Z5P2MVH3CXWECKHA,2023-02-15 19:06:54.086,2,False,496
195438,4,Very comfortable and an excellent value.,"This is an interesting trackball.  I'm a longtime trackball user and have been using them for CAD software since the late 80s.  This design is a cross between two industry favorites the big L's MX Ergo and the big K's Pro Fit Vertical.  It isn't really like either one but shares basic elements.  Also, these both cost considerably more than this offering from Nulea.<br />At 55°, it has a steeper tilt then the Ergo (which is adjustable from 0° to 20° and is about 5° degrees less than the Pro Fit's 60° of tilt.  I like their description of saying it's at the natural handshake position. It really is.  I find this equal to the Pro Fit, I really don't notice the difference between the two hand positions.<br />The big change is in the position of the ball on the mouse.  As stated throughout the product page, this is a trackball for large hands.  And that is really the big thing for me.  On both the Ergo and the Pro Fit the ball is just a little too close to the resting position of the rest of the hand.  To manipulate the mouse on either I have to bend my thumb in.  On the Nulea, the ball is considerably lower down the side of the body.  This allows me to manipulate the wheel with almost minimal thumb movement.  Really this is a pleasure to use overall, but there are a few cons.<br />DPI: There is no DPI indicator so you can't at a glance tell what your current setting it.  So it takes a while to click, test, click... Also the DPI range isn't a nice curve.. +300 then +200 then +200 and finally +400.  I would like also have preferred a starting DPI of less than 500 for true precision work.  I use a trackball specifically for precision and 500 is good, but not great.<br />Software: There isn't any. At all.  So other than using some third party options you would need to investigate on your own, there are no settings, no storing of profile or programmability to the buttons.  Not a huge deal, and at this price point, maybe I'm expecting too much.  Afterall, we're only talking about the two thumb buttons which are set to Forward and Back.",[],B0BML9JYBR,B0C772WXKG,AG4A7QMW2YC5TJ6O5JGXQY6JMDBA,2023-01-03 23:50:24.614,1,False,496
375696,5,Skeptical and Disappointed at first,"Right now, I must own at least four different kinds of earbuds, ranging from Samsung Earbuds Pro to Sennheiser Momentum to Soundcore Life P3, and so on.<br /><br />I am in the airline business, and frequent travel is a must. My go-to headphones for travel are the Sony WH-1000XM4. They are over-the-ear and excellent in ANC and battery life.<br /><br />However, I also wanted in-ear buds with decent ANC for workouts and airplane rides when my over-the-ear phones got tiresome or on shorter trips.<br /><br />Here is my problem: the creator decided to bless me with ear canals, the size you can stick your thumb in. So none of the before-mentioned buds, with their included silicone tips, fit and sealed my ear canals. The result was hardly any ANC and a tiny sound with no bass. The only thing that would work for me is to purchase the largest Comply Foam Tips. They would work better, but now the Earbuds would not fit in their charging case, having me take the foam tips on and off every time I used them, making it a constant pain.<br /><br />The Bose from the start sounded way better than the rest, and after trying out all the options of buds and bands, with all sorts of different insert techniques (frustration city), I found a combination with the large buds and small bands to get a somewhat decent seal.  The test in the app showed green on both buds, but the ANC still had no ""wow"" factor. Running the vacuum was way louder compared to my Sony over-the-ears.<br /><br />When I ordered the Bose Quiet Comfort II, I also had the foresight to order the separate XS and XL earbud kit. It arrived today, and after installing the XL Ear Buds, it has become a game changer. ""WOW"" all the way. Super ANC (the noise running the vacuum is almost not present) and a vast improvement in the sound quality. These are now right up there with my Sony WH-1000XM4.<br /><br />There finally is peace, and the search is over.<br /><br />If you have similar issues, buy these earphones and get the additional earplugs kit.",[],B0B4PSQHD5,B0BFW3RLZ7,AGAZVY6NAGDYUOADRMT6Z73PZPAA,2023-02-02 03:25:40.622,9,True,496
209215,5,The Best Flash Drive Value Deal,"[[VIDEOID:2125dff72e85567828a6f9f1bf29f04c]] These are an excellent variety pack of USB Flash Drives that work just as well as a traditional Hard Drive. Each drive comes with 64GB of storage (59 usable), and they work instantly from the moment you connect them to your PC. Just plug it in, select your files, and you can have them transfer in seconds to minutes depending on their size. Using CDM, the drives average 133MB/s Read and 78MB/s Write Speeds on average, but according to the Windows Dialog Box that opens when transferring files, I was averaging closer to a 42MB/s Write Speed.<br /><br />Each drive also has a protective sliding mechanism that makes protecting the drives and using them a painless experience. These drives are unique in that they don't have any locking mechanism or push tab like some other flash drives- you simply just slide it. Even other sliding drives I’ve used would have a noticeable locking click sound when extended all the way, but this was not the case here. I was originally concerned about this, because I thought since it didn't require a push tab or a locking mechanism to keep the housing in place, I thought it would surely close back up once I tried to use it. Luckily, that did not happen, and in my video demo I even show that as soon as you slide it out, you can push all you want on the top of the USB and it will stay in place perfectly. I was very impressed by this.<br /><br />The drives perform mostly like a traditional HDD in my opinion. Yes, they can have some occasional slow downs, but so can mechanical drives as well. These flash drives are definitely faster than the other ones I have, and for the cost, you get an excellent variety pack of them. Not only do you get 3 of these drives, but you are also getting a total of 192GB in total storage (177 Usable) when you take all 3 into account. So, this makes it easy to use each drive for a specific use- one could be for work documents or student projects, another could be used for photo and video storage, and another could be used as a Windows boot drive. The possibilities are endless, and I would highly recommend these flash drives to anyone who uses lots of them for various tasks.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Sg4xta5mL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Sg4xta5mL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Sg4xta5mL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618FmY66Q3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618FmY66Q3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618FmY66Q3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BKFH3M6Z,B09QBR4GCG,AF7SO6JG76JZKBKRBXAVQJOJBPHQ,2023-02-10 01:27:30.840,1,False,496
722678,4,Good sound isolation (not cancelling) work headphones.,"I work in construction, sell woodworking projects in my own business, and have worked on oil and gas rigs for years. Point being I have worked in a lot of high noise environments, and have a lot of experience with hearing protection.<br /><br />These work well at blocking/isolating sound. But, I doubt they are at the 30dbr rating in actual use, they seem closer to 22-24 to me compared to my 30dbr muffs or 26dbr isolating headphones. This is just a guess, but a guess based on a lot of experience. In any case, this is enough for most people - just not for sustained high decibel sound levels.<br /><br />The sound quality is surprisingly good, and with the large batteries the battery life is great. They lasted me for a week long project, and true to claim I didn't need to charge them and they didn't die during that time. They remained comfortable the whole time in use.<br /><br />Phone calls were made and received with ease, and the people on the other side of the conversation didn't say anything about the sound quality. I answer on these types of devices a fair amount, so that doesn't mean I sounded perfect - but enough it didn't elicit complaints or difficulty conversing.<br /><br />This type of sound blocking headphones reduce situational awareness, especially with music on - so as a caution they aren't great for areas that require it.<br /><br />The only two complaints I would have with this set of headphones are the multifunction button, and the way the foam inserts attach by sliding over a stub. The multifunction button attempts to control too many things at once, and I almost always activated ""game mode"" when attempting to shut them off. Small issue but irritating.<br /><br />The more pressing issue is the foam plugs (which you need to use for the best, safest sound blocking) are slid over a plastic post. From experience with other brands like this - the foam plugs wear out regularly. They tend to split as the primary mode of failure - and this post attachment is probably going to aggravate that. I didn't search for the replacement tips, but make sure to factor in multiple sets a year (minimum 6) when considering the cost.<br /><br />Overall really good sound blocking headphones, not perfect, but good for most uses and users.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615MxjdIo5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615MxjdIo5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615MxjdIo5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZRqcjaN+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZRqcjaN+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZRqcjaN+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iijFgwUOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iijFgwUOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iijFgwUOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710WlngD8bL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710WlngD8bL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710WlngD8bL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71M6dl01qjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71M6dl01qjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71M6dl01qjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sN+lFogFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sN+lFogFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sN+lFogFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BTHS43LV,B0BTHS43LV,AHOIABQHVR7DRIKAC4EAVWEOG6YA,2023-04-02 01:15:06.486,0,False,496

Except.<br /><br />The instruction guide text is written in lettering so small that one with 20/20 vision is going to need a magnifying glass to read it accurately.<br /><br />Next, plug this device into a power socket, and it lights right up, and immediately starts rapidly flashing, which I've come to understand is the ""pairing"" or ""discoverable"" mode.  Using the Alexa ap, and initiating discovery comes up empty.  When you attempt to manaully add the device, by the manufacturer, in this case Amysen, I'm instructed to download and install the ""Amysen ap.""  Great!  Tremendous advice.  Except.<br /><br />The ap I'm told to install - DOESN'T EXIST.  When I search for this ap, I get ""Smart Life"", which supposedly will automatically link up with Alexa.  Good to know, and perhaps Amysen didn't bother creating their own ap, and went with Smart Life and forgot to tell Alexa.  Pretty crummy for software, really.<br /><br />Next, using Smart Life, I could find the device (Hooray!), and operate it on and off, and set up a timer for it.  (Hooray x 2!)<br /><br />Next comes trying to get Alexa to discover the device so it can be controlled by her. Epic fail.  Tried speaking with a live human being from Amazon to resolve this issue, twice, once for almost an hour, and the second time just now for almost 20 minutes and the results were zero.<br /><br />I don't have any idea what in the world is wrong with what I'm doing, or this device.  There are multiple others in my home which Alexa manages to operate very easily.<br /><br />So, my take on this is that while your experience may be quite smooth, mine was not, frustratingly so.<br /><br />When attempting to link this device to her, I recommend having a quart of Maalox or some other antacid nearby.

580428,5,My first security camera...a solid purchase!,"I've had this camera for about a week now and I'm pretty happy with it. I don't know much about cameras like these but have been on the lookout for a decently priced camera that did not break the bank. I only purchased one to test it out and if I liked it, I'd buy another one and well... I want another one of these! I feel this is a great deal! I cannot speak on the battery life as I have my camera plugged into an outlet at all times but it's rained, snowed, been sunny, windy... the camera has stayed recording. I bought an SD card to put into the camera but it's not entirely necessary as you can save motion detected clips right from the app to your advice. I'm assuming the sd card function is more so if the wifi goes out or you want the clips transferred to a computer/laptop. It was easy to set up as well. I can't tell you if you'd need a wifi extender or anything like that as my camera is close by my wifi router. The wifi has to be 2g not 5g. Picture quality is good and you can view the camera stream away from home!<br /><br />Now the only con I'd say is the motion detection. Yes, you can pay a monthly fee to pick what kind of things you want to be detected, which the subscription isn't that crazy of an amount but... this camera only records clips when there's motion detected or you manually go into the VicoHome app and click record. You can adjust the sensitivity to motion detection and whatnot in the app but if you place this camera at a house facing somewhat of a busy road, it's going to give you a notification on the VicoHome app every time. It records the motion for about 10-20 seconds depending on what you choose. Overall, I'm happy with this camera. It's a good first camera for people who are looking to get one and the price is great. I will say, I did have to buy an SD card with this and it is recommended but I'm not sure it's exactly needed if you plan to do the subscription cloud service through VicoHome. The camera holder that you drill into could be a better material as it's plasticky so be careful with that but other than these things, I'm happy to have a camera that gets the job done.",[],B09CKYBJK3,B0C4YDWD6H,AEU4URWTXLPP7RRUH77UCKYA7B2Q,2023-03-12 16:02:25.200,7,True,495
588303,1,"Poor software, hard to get photos to frame, unstable","Update 5/8/2033:<br />The set schedule is unstable. After a few days after setting the frame to turn off at 10p.m., it wouldn't turn off, keeping waking me up in the middle of the night (my moving legs trigger the motion sensor). I reset it, and after a couple of days the same behavior returned. In the trash it goes, one star down for this!<br />Original review:<br />This digital picture frame is a great way to display your favorite pictures. I ordered it for our bedroom.<br />The motion sensor is a great feature, automatically turning on the display when someone is nearby, and you can set the time it will turn off after no motion is detected (minimum is 2 minutes). You can set the frame to turn automatically on/off based on a schedule, which is good for nighttime.<br />The quality of the display is average, it does not have FHD resolution. The 16GB of internal storage provides enough space to store your favorite memories, but in the features description is stated it has 32GB.  The touchscreen is not very responsive, do not expect the same responsiveness as for a mobile phone.<br />The setup was straightforward, but uploading the photos requires downloading an awkward app. I do not like the app, it is not intuitive at all, and it only lets you select 50 photos at once for upload. There is also the option to send photos by e-mail. Really? In 2023? What a joke! I do not feel comfortable sharing my photos or email address with a shady app.<br />I tried to plug in a memory stick in the USB port, but the space is so tight it will only fit a standard USB connector. My memory stick is maybe 2 mm thicker than the USB connector, so I was disappointed that I was forced to use a cable to plug in the stick into the frame.

965297,5,Exactly what I wanted,"[[VIDEOID:cbb0b6303fbc4d6c8d7a9482085c0e2f]] I already had a laptop stand that I used at home, but it was a solid one-piece design that was very bulky to transfer to the office or a cafe/coffee shop.<br /><br />I was looking for a second laptop stand that I could adjust AND that would fold to be mostly flat so it would easily fit in my laptop bag. The abilty to fold this stand makes it really worth the value.<br /><br />I can't stress that enough.<br /><br />As a college student, a designer, and an artist, who carries their work with them almost EVERYWHERE, this stand is my bestfriend since it elevates my monitor so I do not have to look down for hours and incur back/neck pains, while also very light and easy to stash.<br /><br />I love that I can adjust the stand with a lot of precision to fit any display style like for drawing on my iPad, or using my laptop to type, watching movies, etc.<br /><br />My laptop is actually bigger than the stand, it's 17in and this stand does not budge or buckle under the weight. It can handle a laptop much bigger than it but only at certain angles. Just don't angle the stand too far forward or too far back and it will carry a larger laptop just fine.<br /><br />Also, boy is it stable! The only time I found this stand to not be stable is when it's on an uneven surface like a mattress, or if you angle it too far forward/backward. This happens because the stand is very light, if it were heavier then it would not fall forward/backward because of the weight of your laptop forcing it to. But that is a strength in my opinion since it makes the stand very convenient to carry in a messenger bag, satchel, or laptop bag.<br /><br />Overall I really love this stand, so much so that I don't even use the original one I bought for home use anymore 😅! The pink is really nice, very much like the photos and it's a super convenient buy for any student, artist, or anyone who doesn't want neck/back pain while using their laptop or equivalent device while on the go.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61W58VOGJpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61W58VOGJpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61W58VOGJpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61e6VLiXeJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61e6VLiXeJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61e6VLiXeJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uaMKUsxDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uaMKUsxDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uaMKUsxDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BKSPYJ89,B0BS53FR4B,AH6WAQ5E6F6UDSHEEPVJV7VYJPHA,2023-03-18 01:45:01.592,0,True,495
509639,5,Fangore has provided amazing Specs for a Good Price!,"[[VIDEOID:a54adb9c8c213e09ea6ec37264af74ea]] One of the first things you will notice when you remove the projector from the box is that it comes in a heavy duty carry bag which is unbelievably useful because it comes with a handle and it can contain all of your components including third party components like media sticks from Amazon or Roku.<br /><br />This is a big time serious projector & it is more than enough to use as a permanent home theater projector for parties and events at your home.<br /><br />You can control it using Miracast or Aircast depending on whether you have an Android or Apple device. You can just wirelessly control it using your phone....it's great.<br /><br />You can also utilize the HDMI cord which comes in the box to connect this to your PC or laptop, or even a PlayStation or Xbox. So you could theoretically get on your PC, connect the projector using the HDMI cable that it comes with, sign into your Netflix or Hulu account, or YouTube, ESPN+, Disney+, etc and the projector will screen your content directly onto any white wall or projector screen.<br /><br />Getting a projector tripod for about $30 is not necessarily but I recommend it.<br /><br />Lastly, I recommend buying a media stick unless you already have one. Two popular models are the Amazon Firestick or the Roku HD 4k... Both run about $40 and will make your life incredibly easier because you don't have to use your phone or the HDMI cord. You can sit and mess with your phone without worrying about screwing up the movie you were trying to watch.<br /><br />The maximum display size is 300"" which equates to 25 ft from corner to corner.<br /><br />It also has Bluetooth 5.0 so you can set up a bunch of speakers all around the room and have true surround sound.<br /><br />This projector truly recreates an IMAX theater. It is able to utilize 12 million color variations, and they will be amazingly bright because it has 450 ANSI lumens which is incredible.<br /><br />What you get for the price in this case is a complete steal.<br /><br />Watch my video where I discuss things further.<br /><br />A+ Device....great price for what you get.",[],B0BNHW16TC,B0BNHW16TC,AH7SXZ2SHY5PTIWQD4LOSY5FDZ2A,2023-02-17 13:53:10.003,0,False,495
478582,5,One hella of an upgrade!,"I've been playing around with the webcam and it's one hella of an upgrade in comparison to the Nexigo N60. Overall a great camera but it may a bit overkill if you are not planning to use it a lot.<br /><br />Pros<br />*The image quality is amazing<br />*Being able to set the angles with a control<br />*The software for the webcam is very easy to comprehend and the control can do most of those things too!<br />*USB connection; it doesn't need to be connected directly to the pc to work properly. I use a USB tower and there's no lag nor any other problem<br />*Wide lens!! Or well, I can see way more of my room with this new webcam than the previous one I have. And then you just adjust the zoom and angle w the control and your set.<br />*You can mount it on the wall or ceiling and with the control, you can still make the image look good.<br />*If you're not happy with the setting you applied it's easy to back to the default settings by pressing Home.<br />*Mute bottom!! The controller has a mute button and also a camera-blocking function. You can use both at the same time too. The screen will just go black but the webcam will still be on.<br /><br />Cons<br />*I've hopped in calls to test out the built-in mic and I've been told more than once to go back to my normal mic lol<br />*You can't pop it on your monitor like smaller webcams, and if you just put it on your desk it will 1) give a nice view of your double chin and 2)block your view on the monitor (not by a lot but it's there).<br />*Had to put a small floating shelf so I can set the camera there and point it to myself. This also adds the effect that I'm always looking down although I'm looking at my monitors.<br />*On my laptop I can see a nice image, but sometimes the people you are calling won't appreciate the same quality.<br />*Sometimes in calls, when you are already using zoom, the camera won't go up/down/left/right for whatever reason. So you have to unzoom, change the position and then zoom in again.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xlTHthSdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xlTHthSdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xlTHthSdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nf0aN+pHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nf0aN+pHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nf0aN+pHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61spml6GCnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61spml6GCnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61spml6GCnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09WY77FX4,B0BDFF4WD7,AFAFZM5LYU4KJB3F4VS7QQ72CTTA,2023-03-07 06:45:15.615,0,True,495
832558,5,It's quite loud,"As a duster, it's pretty loud, but it seems to be more powerful than other dusters I've used. Much like the other duster I tried, this one charges via USB, but it has USB A and USB C on it.  The USB ports are behind a rubber cover to prevent water from getting in, but the cover is actually flush with the rest of the handle and thus it's hard to get it to open when you want it open.  I wind up having to get something like a toothpick to dig at the corner until it comes off.<br /><br />The included attachments fit into the recessed area on the front and are held in entirely by friction.  At the moment it's fine but I feel like eventually it'll start to wear down and the parts might slip out.  I suppose at that point I'll have to tape around the end of the attachments to ensure they have enough friction to stay on.  It hasn't happened yet though.<br /><br />The device also has a small LED light in the front which I don't really find that useful.  I'm not dusting my computer at night, though I suppose it might help.  The unusual thing is that it also flashes red and white.  I guess if you carry this with you in the car then it might help as a roadside warning flasher, but I'm not sure why I'd keep this in the car.  It's not like I'm going to inflate my tires with it.  I'm not even sure it's powerful enough to do that.<br /><br />The side panel has an indicator to show it's on (which shows battery level) as well as which power level you're on at the moment.  P1 blows at about 12 MPH, P2 blows at about 20 MPH, and P3 blows at about 25 MPH.  The high-pitched whine is not quite as loud as your leaf blower, but it's close.  I'd say if you're going to use this for extended periods, you might want some ear plugs.<br /><br />The included attachments are fine for dusting, and it also came with some brushes to help remove dust from cracks and crevices.  Overall, it's a good duster, though I question the value of the ""HD digital screen"" and the flashing red/white lights.",[],B0BQC1WHRM,B0BWCSWSV6,AG52AVK2Q73VJ4FWUUA6ZVL72B5Q,2023-02-03 20:56:08.352,0,False,495
335950,4,"Gets the job done nicely, but there are a few things I don't like","Other reviewers have done a great summarizing features, so I won't repeat. Below are my impressions of this case, including what I like, and what could be better.<br /><br />The good:<br />* This is a sturdily built case that will provide excellent protection<br />* The trackpad is a nice feature not found on all keyboard cases, and it works well<br />* The keyboard attaches magnetically to the case, and there's little chance of it falling out<br />* I like the keyboard's cool blue backlight feature<br />* The included instructions are good, and I needed them to pair manually when Bluetooth didn't automatically recognize the keyboard as it usually does<br /><br />What could be better:<br />* The first thing I noticed is that this case is REALLY heavy, even without the keyboard. It's because of the magnetic plate sandwiched between the case's vinyl. With the keyboard, the case weighs the same as my iPad, so with the iPad and case combined, total weight is more than a slim 13"" laptop. For me, this is reason enough to use this case only when I need the keyboard, and not for every day use.<br />* Because of the trackpad, the keyboard feels slightly cramped compared to other case keyboards. I'm willing to accept this tradeoff because I like the trackpad, but you should keep this in mind when deciding what's important to you in a case.<br />* The keyboard itself feels incredibly light, and not in a good way. I'm not confident it will stand up to heavy use, and when typing there's a cheap creaking sound that comes from the keyboard body flexing, not from the keys.<br />* In my opinion, the keys feel slightly stiff and harder to press than they should be. Some people might like a firmer touch, but I'm the opposite.<br />* This case doesn't include the Auto-shutoff/Turn on feature. I thought most iPad cases include the feature where the iPad turned on when the cover opens, and shuts off when the cover is closed. Perhaps I'm wrong.<br /><br />The bottom line: If you aren't bothered by the things I mentioned above that I don't like, this is a great case and will meet your needs nicely. For me, I'll keep searching for another case.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CtIcoN8OL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CtIcoN8OL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CtIcoN8OL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BR8V3KLY,B0C68S5LJX,AH3WQZCPXLJ4SVLFJWQ2YNRPR7IA,2023-03-10 17:54:32.558,0,False,495
512496,4,Seemingly standard,"I've wondered what bone conduction headphones were like. It's interesting how it works. There are two square shaped pieces that vibrate and rest on the zygomatic bones in your skull. The sound is transmitted to your ear bones and drums from there.<br /><br />These sound good too. It's not studio or audiophile grade, but they are decent. It has a good bass response, and the mids and highs are clear.<br /><br />It takes a little being used to, but I like these better than earbuds. It does this weird vibration, sometimes, when the audio starts. It feels like someone flicked me lightly on the zygo. I first joked that my headphones assaulted me. It felt a bit uncountable at first, but, now, I barely notice it.<br /><br />These wrap around the ear and the back of the head when worn. I really dislike the part that wraps around the head, because when I put my head back on a chair it will bump them, and I have to set my head back awkwardly when sitting.<br /><br />They're fine for sports and other activities. They stay on good. No problems there. They are waterproof but I'm not sure they're submersible. They are made with good materials and components.<br /><br />I can hear things around me better due to the open ear design. It's not foolproof, but it allows one to be a little more aware of their surroundings. They come with ear plugs, because you can hear with these better if you plug your ears. Weird, right? It's a trip.<br /><br />I wear these a lot. Sometimes, I forget I'm even wearing them. I love that they're Bluetooth. No more wires. The battery lasts a good while, and it doesn't take too long to charge.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the price is at the time you're reading this. They were over $100 when I received them, but it seems they may be available for much less now. I think that's a high price. I hope they're still reduced price.<br /><br />I think these are good though. I like wearing these when watching videos and listening to music. Many times I'm cleaning out working out too.

166198,5,Great Keyboard & Mouse Combo - Bluetooth + RF Connectivity,"I really like this combo a lot, keyboard is so thin and elegant, mouse is elegant too. I purchased this to use with my Gigabyte Aero 16 Laptop and it looks and works great. It's certainly the very best wireless set up I have ever used.<br /><br />I tested connected both with Bluetooth and the included RF dongle. Both methods of connection work flawlessly but I found both to be of very slightly less range than a Logitech combo connected via a universal dongle, but not enough to be problematic. Since my laptop has no USB-A ports the Bluetooth connection is very welcome. Both mouse and keyboard have a 3 position switch with Off/Bluetooth/RF positions.  This allows you to use both with two different PC's if you wanted, but it's a little inconvenient to have to switch both on a regular basis. Both charge via the included USB-C cable.<br /><br />The keyboard has all the usual keys and a numeric keypad. The finish on the keyboard is a pleasing matt black that doesn't attract fingerprints. The keys are relatively light to use and are almost silent in use but have enough tactile feedback to be nice to use. Indicator lights are provided for num lock and caps lock which extinguish after a second or so of inactivity presumably to save battery. There is no backlighting on the keyboard which is a normal thing for wireless keyboards. The keyboard is quite heavy, rigid and just has a quality feel to it. There is also an included kickstand that magnetically attaches to raise the rear of the keyboard.<br /><br />The mouse top is a slightly shiny black grained finish with a pleasing grey tactile panel where your thumb sits. The button next to the mouse wheel selects different DPI for the mouse pointer, there are 4 settings. The mouse is accurate in use and fits my hand perfectly. The two side buttons work as next and previous page in Chrome as you would expect. These have a slightly imprecise feel to them but other than that they work well.<br /><br />The quality of this combo is evident from the moment you unpack them. The keyboard comes wrapped in black tissue paper and it's weight, thinness and finish making it feel quite exquisite. The mouse is also relatively heavy and looks and feels like a quality item.

827917,2,"No SD card will fit, terrible instructions","You know how people make fun of Google translate for inaccurate and weird translations? I wish the people who made this camera had used Google translate so the instructions would be SOMEWHAT readable.<br /><br />This also came with a rear camera despite not mentioning it in the listing, which was a fun surprise, but the instructions don't mention the rear camera *at all* so there's no way to tel how to set it up, even with the instructions essentially being gibberish.<br /><br />The instructions do say something about connecting the camera to the PC, but there's no way to do that with the included hardware - the camera, the rear camera, the mount, and the cord that plugs the camera into your car. There's no camera-to-PC cord included and no indication of what sort of cord you would even need (the plug on the camera is not like the plug you see on Apple or Android devices).<br /><br />The dashboard mount is useless. It flatout just does not work. It screws into the camera just fine, but it doesn't adhere to the glass at all.<br /><br />And finally, no SD card works with this thing. It doesn't include an SD card, the instructions don't make it clear what exactly you need beyond ""32 GB capacity"" (seems really bizarre to me that the camera can't use a memory card that holds more than 32 GB but whatever). You need a micro-sd card, but the trouble is there's at least 4 kinds of micro-sd card and the instructions don't specify WHICH. I've bought two different micro-sd cards and neither of them work - they won't go into the slot, the camera won't read them. Both were SD-HC micro cards, so I thought perhaps I just needed the very basic oldest version that's just Micro-SD. But those have the capacity of up to 2 GB, when the instructions say ""capacity 32 GB"". So I have no idea. I'm irritated enough at now spending extra money on micro-sd cards that don't work PLUS a separate dashboard mount that I realize I could've just bought an entirely different dashcam at this point.<br /><br />But it's pretty and the picture quality was good from what I could see when it was plugged in - it couldn't record anything but it still showed stuff on the screen.",[],B0B9R8WWK9,B0B9R8WWK9,AH54CCDUHTBHFWYAWYML3ANFJMOQ,2023-02-28 01:15:27.835,0,False,495
438196,5,Must have and so much better then what Blink supplies,"I own a number of Blink cameras, and all the outdoor cameras are attached to trees. I quickly discovered this can be an issue if you have curious squirrels, raccoons, crows or neighborhood cats (my property is frequented by all four) as the mounts Blink supplies with their cameras are simply pathetic. Just a slight nudge by critter or strong gust of wind and the camera is dislodged--and trying to adjust where the camera points while it's ""attached"" to the original Blink mount is a massive aggravation. These replacement mounts are hands down worth every penny. In truth you don't need directions as it's obvious how to mount them. They are certainly no more difficult to mount than those awful little ones that come with the cameras, the visor above the camera does in fact protect it from rain and, to a lesser degree dust/pollen and it will clearly add an extra layer of protection against moisture getting into the battery compartment as long as you have the camera pointing slightly downwards. The mount itself screws securely into the housing that surrounds the camera, so no more cameras popping off the mount by a gentle nudge or a blast of wind--which could damage your camera, assuming you could locate it afterwards. Once mounted and the camera oriented the way you want (which is a breeze) and all the adjustments tightened, it's rock steady. A squirrel happily demonstrated that it won't budge when he sat on it, then he and a friend raced up and down the tree the camera was mounted on, sometimes using the camera as a launching pad and the camera did not move. We also had a pretty decent windstorm a few days ago and while I'd always been worried for my cameras in really bad weather, as all are fully exposed to whatever Mother Nature throws at my property, these new mounts held fast--no issues. It also does not in ANY way interfere with night vision These new mounts might also stump any would-be or opportunistic thieves, or at least make them work for their ill-gotten gains (in the process allowing the camera time to get good mug shot) as it might not be obvious how to remove the camera to anyone unfamiliar with this mount. That's another plus: if you need to remove the camera, to replace the batteries, the mount/camera housing will remain precisely the way you wanted it--no more repositioning once you replace the camera in its housing.",[],B09T3978QC,B0C6V412WD,AGDOTH4OIPNGGCU7B7Q34BVSCUSQ,2023-04-03 21:09:24.585,0,False,495
775844,5,Works well for my needs,"I like to listen to rain sounds as a sleep aid. The earbuds I use have been working better for me than quite a few I’ve tried, except that the cord is way too short. I’ve lost count of how many times my phone has slipped off the nightstand while I tried to change positions or make an adjustment to the cord.<br /><br />I measured the cable itself (not including the hardware on either end) at just under 38”, so the cord gives you a little over 3 feet of extra length. It’s essentially doubled the length of the earbuds I will be using with the extender. The cable has a rubbery covering that has a soft texture to it.<br /><br />When I plugged my headphone jack in for the first time, I thought for a moment that the female connector was the wrong size since the jack wasn’t holding, but it turned out you have to push it in a little harder until it snaps into place. I assume they wanted to ensure a firm connection between the two cables so you don’t accidentally disconnect them with incidental movements. It gives a good hold, and I don’t have trouble unplugging them from each other either.<br /><br />I have to use a dongle to connect my headphones to my phone, so I was a little worried that two connections would not work out so well. I was pleased to see that it worked as expected, and gave me plenty of extra length to lie comfortably in bed with my earbuds in. I tapped along the length of the extension cord and moved it around to see if it created any disturbances to the audio, and didn’t find any issues.<br /><br />The product description mentions that the cord won’t be compatible with a microphone. This isn’t an issue for me since I specifically use earbuds with no microphone or controller for bedtime. I tested the extender with another set of earbuds that includes a microphone and a controller, since I wasn’t sure from the description if the controller would be affected in addition to the microphone. For anyone else who might be wondering, the extender does not have the necessary hardware to handle the button controls, so if that’s a requirement for you then you’ll want to look for something different.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+P7BUMKpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+P7BUMKpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+P7BUMKpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715ULVawfQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715ULVawfQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715ULVawfQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719BtqfZ3WL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719BtqfZ3WL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719BtqfZ3WL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fO1RYaHaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fO1RYaHaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fO1RYaHaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/817O8e7UPXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/817O8e7UPXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/817O8e7UPXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BPSSXDKG,B0BPSSXDKG,AHUESYDPTZ6THQO6YPIPXIQM5H4A,2023-02-05 19:28:15.664,1,False,495

Here they are:<br />1. if you want to view events, you have to have subscription. In fact, if you want to camera to do anything legit you need subscription. Even then I'm not sure it would work right.<br />2. software is full of bugs. Rules do not function correctly. If you set certain rules, they simply do not function. Example: you set the camera to not detect motion and send notification during certain times, it will still do it.<br />3. waypoints (individual quick pan views) just get deleted randomly. you have no idea what the default will be either. apparently it's the last waypoint you set but who knows how true that is. no way to set defaut.<br />4. sensitivy setting is all over the place. There's no way to tell what the range is and it will take forever to figure out what setting makes sense.

612093,5,I use this for work and I talk to clients all day sound is amazing,"They connected super easy to my Bluetooth. I can charge it overnight and won’t have to charge it for maybe three days. I’m on the phones for about six hours a day. They can’t hear any background noise and with this headset they hear me very clearly I can walk around my house washing dishes while I’m talking to a client and they have no idea that I’m doing house work and they can still hear me very clearly and I can hear them extremely clearly as well. The meet button is on the side with the microphone by your ear. You just tap it really quick, so like if I need to call for something, I’ll tap it really fast and with most headsets whenever you press the mute button that robotic voice will say microphone muted, this one does not do that which I love because I don’t miss anything that they’ve said, it’s just click of a button to mute it  And then click it again and it’s as if you never click mute or anything. I love this headset Bluetooth range for it being wireless it’s pretty amazing. My desk is way by my kitchen and I go to the back of my house on my balcony and I could still hear them very clearly no problems no static  Battery life is A1 which it obviously is very important in the car. Clarity is amazing as well order it it’s great for the price. Actually it should be more pricey but it isn’t this. It’s it is wonderful doesn’t feel cheap. It doesn’t come with a headset bag for you to put it in but that’s not really an issue for me , it does come with the charging wire so you need one of those charger boxes that you plug into the wall and then input the charging cable to connect to the headset just to let it charge to get a full charge maybe an hour but I always just plug it in at night before I go to bed and when you do plug it in and connect it will tell you when you turn it on  if the battery is full medium or low when you first turn it on so you already know where you’re at with the battery life which is cool so my advice is to go ahead and added to go especially if you work from home and I just talk to clients or customers or guests",[],B09674F2X6,B09674F2X6,AG6F3TZ44GJLQRJDXFGTP3E2LTNA,2023-03-05 19:31:35.992,7,True,495
588622,5,Tozo does it again,"Full disclosure I am a big fan of Apple air pod pros. I use my AirPod pros pretty consistently, however lately they have been glitchy when I’m working from home in a teams meeting or zoom meeting. I work from home and almost exclusively use headphones during my meetings on a daily basis. My wife and children are home some of those days and I need noise cancellation to drown out their sound sometimes.<br /><br />When my AirPods started glitching, I bought a pair of Tozo clear earbuds however, they were not noise cancellation . These headphones are spectacular. The active noise cancellation functionality works great for a pair of in ear buds. Noise, cancellation, and sound quality is on par with the first generation AirPod pros. I couldn’t compare them to the second GEN AirPod pros because I don’t have them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Sound quality is great<br />-Battery display on the case makes it easy to read and know how much battery you have left.<br />-The battery lasts a very long time. I charge the case once and use my earbuds about two hours every day and the case is at 43%.<br />-The earbuds do not slip out. They fit ergonomically in my ear and come with several different tips to customize for you and user.<br />-please connect to my phone automatically via Bluetooth every time without any issues.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-earwax or oil, for my skin shows up easily in the case, and on the earbuds themselves. Strictly aesthetically speaking does not affect the performance of the earbuds at all.<br />-The case is super slick, and there is no loophole to attach any sort of lanyard or clip. I’m nervous about them slipping out of my pocket easily.<br />-additional application to change the settings of the earbuds is required. I have not downloaded the application to try it. and functionality are accessible by touching the earbuds.<br /><br />For the price I don’t think there’s a better set of earbuds out there with the sound quality and features. These earbuds are truly worth the price. I would highly recommend them to anybody looking for an alternative to AirPods.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iVcvmih7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iVcvmih7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iVcvmih7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71l7vArdClL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71l7vArdClL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71l7vArdClL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BS3SYYBP,B0BS3SYYBP,AGZFXNVZ4EQPPDAMFSV4PQ6P26MQ,2023-04-07 03:28:54.414,0,True,495
860843,3,Doesn't provide the results I was hoping for,"I was hoping this docking station would be an avenue to add ports to my Dell laptop which only has two built-in USB-C ports.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I plugged my laptop into the PD charging port was a continuous little caution symbol over the battery symbol in the taskbar.  I have the Dell AC adapter connected to the PD charging port but the symbol is alerting to reduced battery charging speeds.  After research, I discovered that the100W PD is undersized for the XPS 15 9500.  This PD charging port supports 100W/87W/61W (20V and 5A) but my 9500 takes 90W at exactly 20V and 4.5A.  Since the PD charging port doesn't support 90W this means that my XPS is only charging at 60 or 65w - thus reduced charging speeds.<br /><br />I then went on to read the ""manual"" which points out the USB 3 ports are intended for data transfer and not recommended for charging iPads, tablets or smartphones.  The manual also states that this device is not intended to support an external hard drive which I use daily.  It will also not support wireless mouse/keyboard receivers which I currently use.  So I am not able to free up those two USB C ports on my laptop.<br /><br />Another issue I have is the cable from the docking station to the laptop is just too short.  Like many people, I have my laptop on a riser and because of that, the docking station just dangles from the USB-C port on my laptop so I currently have it sitting on a box.  I would think there would be even more issues with the cord for those with a full size desktop.<br /><br />I did test the data transfer from my phone to my laptop and from an SD card and I had no issues.  Also, my monitor is plugged into one of the HDMI ports and is working with no lag.<br /><br />So I'm on the fence about recommending this.  1. I'm not sure if there will be long-term issues with it slow-charging my computer and 2. I'm not sure how much use I will get from this product based on my specific needs/peripherals .

My idea was to mount my webcam on a flexible arm that I could move directly in the middle of my screen when I’m using it, so it looks like I am watching the person.<br /><br />This desk mounted stand has a traditional camera screw mount, which I was able to use to mount to my camera.<br /><br />Initially, it was shorter than I needed to reach the center of my monitor, but due to the included camera screw mount, I was able to extending it using my standard camera accessories.  Now it is perfectly centered on my screen for my video conferences.  As a bonus, it folds up out my way, when not in use.<br /><br />NOTE:<br /><br />Because there are no locking screws on the joints, you are entirely dependent on the stiffness of the joints for supporting whatever you attach.<br /><br />At first, the webcam weight was too much and it kept drooping down.  Eventually, once I changed the ending orientation of the ball joint, I was able to get the camera to stay upright.  Between the webcam, and my extension arm I added, I was probably exceeding the ending weight capacity.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Stiff Joints to support devices<br />- Flexible Orientation W/ Rotating main arm<br />- Included Camera Mount<br />- Cable Holders<br /><br />CONS<br />- No Screws on Joints to Hold in Place<br />- No Instructions<br /><br />I recommend the mount for light equipment.  Nothing heavier than a small webcam.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KYYwLaTeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KYYwLaTeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KYYwLaTeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61T60UGsUVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61T60UGsUVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61T60UGsUVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nZB3qhB5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nZB3qhB5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nZB3qhB5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61roz0VcdBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61roz0VcdBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61roz0VcdBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xh16iBdyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xh16iBdyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xh16iBdyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814goP39dNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814goP39dNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814goP39dNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BVVL9QMT,B0BVVL9QMT,AGMVSBKQMUKZHZYYF6W2XNKZBCSA,2023-03-26 17:30:03.979,0,False,495
463909,3,Good Floodlight Camera But...,"After one month of service, I feel as though I can give an honest assessment of the overall performance of this camera. Admittedly I had high hopes for this device but over the last month, my hopes went from impressed to just OK. The install was fairly easy and it did set up perfectly the first time. The video quality  is very good and the motion detection is very sensitive but after adjustments, works pretty good. The lights are bright at their brightest setting and can be dimmed to your preferred light level. About a week later, without warning, when I manually tried to turn the floodlight on or off, it would turn back on even with the motion detection turned off. The lights were basically on all-the-time. I ultimately had to perform a soft reset of the device by holding the button down for 20-seconds and subsequently had to reset the network settings. Worked good for another week before  it started losing connection to the network. My second Ring device, which is located about 10-feet from this one, was working fine so I knew it wasn't due to the Wi-Fi quality. It lost connection and it would not reconnect, no matter what I did, even after performing the soft reset. What fixed it this time was having to turn off the circuit breaker for about a minute removing all power from the device an turning it back on. We will call this a hard reset. After setting everything back up again, It has been working pretty well. That was a week ago. What's funny is that the arm/disarm schedule did not work right after the initial installation but after the hard reset has been working fine. Software issue? Hardware issue? Not sure. My advice to you if you should decide to purchase this device is to install in in-line on/off switch if it is not already set up that way. That way you don't have to hit the breaker when you need to do a hard reset. You will just be resetting the Ring floodlight and not everything else on the circuit. That is what I did. The issues you are reading about in the other reviews are very much legit and I can attest to that. However, it is a pretty good security device and it works well when it works. We will see how long it works after the hard reset and perhaps, if everything works right,  I might upgrade this review to a four-star rating. Stay tuned.",[],B08F6GPQQ7,B0BW543RH8,AEE42473IG7LYQV3QF4ZKXJIWCXQ,2023-03-26 05:32:02.608,2,True,495
838268,5,"Fantastic ""Prosumer"" Switch","Summary:<br />Everything most home lab or SOHO users need in a switch at an attractive price.<br /><br />Details:<br />Prior to my current career, I was studying for my Cisco networking certifications which left me somewhat dismissive of consumer-level gear. In particular, I've always felt the need for a nice managed switch.  Unfortunately it is just hard to justify buying a $1,000 infrastructure switch or even a $500 Ubiquity, and a lot of the other ""managed"" switches for home users are light on features. After all, if I am honest I just need a couple of VLANs and a few PoE ports.<br /><br />This piece of Aruba kit perfectly balances price and features. It provides you with 24 ports (12 Power-over-Ethernet), 2 SFP to provide interface options, and all the features most people need. Even better it has an easy to access, local web-interface that makes setting VLANs and debugging problems exceedingly easy. In particular, I really like the PoE interface which clearly explains how many watts each device is using and can even prioritize shutdowns in the case of an overly large power demand. It even has a well documented CLI interface if you prefer that.<br /><br />In addition to the basics it has most of the options I could see needing in a SOHO setup like spanning tree protocol and port mirroring. And all of this is clearly exposed, if not explained, in the web interface. I haven't tried their remote interface and I probably will not as I prefer to run things locally, but it is a nice option to have.<br /><br />In addition, the hardware is solid and has a fan that changes speed depending on load. In my rack I think it is off most of the time... or at least is quieter than the other fans in the system.<br /><br />The only downside I see to it, ironically given its name, is that it takes a bit longer to come up after being turned on and off than I would prefer. It isn't a huge deal because this will likely be restarted once every six months or so!<br /><br />If you know enough about networks to need a managed switch, this will be easy to operate and setup. Plus I think it hits a real sweet spot between price and performance.",[],B09NN4B5YJ,B0CBNZ1B5Z,AGZCKFSUYTQKVDBVILKKP4NVIZJQ,2023-03-06 03:03:03.916,0,False,495
559907,4,"Good camera for the price, but needs a few improvements","This is a decent camera for the price-point, but there are two, possibly three, improvements that need to be made.<br /><br />1. Privacy shutter is hard to see.<br />There is a tiny slider switch on the camera itself that you can move in order to engage the privacy cover.  This switch, and the privacy cover itself, are difficult to see.  This makes it hard to tell if the privacy shutter is covering the lens or not.<br /><br />I think they should paint the switch and the cover (or even just the cover) a much lighter color in order to let you easily tell whether it is engaged or not.  It's a small change, but would greatly improve the camera.<br /><br />2. The ring light switch lacks a stopper.  You rotate it and it goes from off to dim to fully lit to off to dim...etc...  This means that if you are trying to turn the light off, you can't really tell if you've turned it off or just dimmed it.  It also means if you try to turn it off, you are very likely to rotate past off and into fully bright light blasting you in the face when you least expect it.<br /><br />There should be a full stopper or even just something that provides tactile feedback letting you know the light is off.  It's another small change, but would really improve the product<br /><br />3. Autofocus.  Don't get me wrong, the autofocus works decently, but depending on the room lighting, it may constantly refocus.  I found I have to have a decent amount of room lighting and not just the camera's ring light, in order to avoid it continuously refocusing.<br /><br />Those are just my three suggestions on how this product could be easily improved (well, the first two at least).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong though.  It's a good camera for the price.  You get a built-in light that is dimmable (with a lot of flexibility and not just two or three stages of dimming).  You also get a remote that will allow you to zoom in.  The remote even lets you temporarily shut off the video, sort of like a software privacy shutter that resets whenever you restart your recording/web conf session.",[],B09QKR8P6T,B09QKR8P6T,AHD7CZJMPTNV5H3S2XHLW4KTZKWQ,2023-02-28 15:12:41.618,2,True,495

First impressions were pretty good actually everything was in the box packed very neatly, however I could tell the film on the suction cup was replaced there were a ton of air pockets under the film, I was going to wait to put it in my car, but now I needed to check and made sure it wasn't used before.<br /><br />I turn on the unit and check Bluetooth settings and it was connected to someone else's phone. I am not happy with paying full price for something that was used, but everything was in perfect condition, so for now I'm fine with it because its like new.<br /><br />Took a little bit to get it to work, the instructions are very vague and not well put together. It does work and it's running nicely. It is a bit slow here and there, but if you let it run for around 15 - 20 minutes it'll run smoothly.

149197,4,almost perfect!,"This is a really nice bag. I have a 16"" MacBook Pro and it fits in here perfectly. The padding is soft and thick to protect my Mac and it slides easily in and out of its little pocket. Speaking of pockets - there are plenty of them. I really like the zippered outside pockets where I can keep things handy and better organized than my last bag. They are also within easy reach. I keep pens and business cards in one and a baggy filled with cables in the other. I'm sure this may change over time as I use this more. there are also inside mesh pockets which work great to hold my mouse, a video adapter, and my USB converter attachment. The main inside pocket is where my power cable goes and there's still room for more. There are also outside pockets on each side that do not zip down, but you can slide in books or other things that you need ready access to and don't need secured.<br /><br />I like that it comes with both handles and a carry strap. The thing about the shoulder carry strap, though, is that it attaches on the flat sides of the bag rather than the ends, which I find odd. I did know this when I ordered it, because it's shown in the photos, of course. So far that hasn't been an issue, but I've not taken this on a airplane trip yet, so we'll see how that goes. Oh, the strap on the one side to slide this onto the handle of a carry-on suitcase is great. It is just slightly too small for my REI carry-on suitcase handle, though. I did manage to get it on there, but it is a really tight fit over the handle and then slides easily once its on the bars.<br /><br />I have not tried the power adapter yet, but the inside USB came damaged - it somehow got squished. Also as noted in the product description, you need to have your own power supply, this is just the adapter cables. One thing the description states is that the cables are removable from the inside - but they are not - at least not that I can figure out how without getting a tiny screwdriver out and removing the entire thing.<br /><br />Bottom line is that it is a nice bag with plenty of storage and a padding. If I can repair the USB cable it just might be a 5-star bag.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FIfqrebKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FIfqrebKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FIfqrebKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SqZVZYJ-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SqZVZYJ-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SqZVZYJ-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zgSOHYSsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zgSOHYSsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zgSOHYSsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KYi-bHfpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KYi-bHfpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KYi-bHfpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B3B2VKZ2,B0B3B2VKZ2,AF5JU3VCZM2XNQAN6T7NFJEENENA,2023-01-01 13:51:47.304,0,False,495
240855,5,A fantastic pair of headphones- GREAT VALUE,"[[VIDEOID:ed37edc384541d51266e51e751494e86]] I love these headphones!  I’ll start with the case, I love that it is smaller than other cases I’ve seen in this style of head phone, the USB C charging is a huge plus for me as I can’t stand the devices I still have with the mini USB.  I also really like that the display is on the inside of the case cover – I prefer it that way as sometimes in can be annoying to have the display flashing.  As far as the headphones are concerned themselves, they are just perfect at this price point.  Very sleek from a design standpoint.  They fit me very comfortably, but also come with additional pads so you can adjust to fit.  They stay on when I workout and not only that, they also stay in – I’ve had other headphone that stay on your ear, but wiggle free as you exercise – that is not the case with these in my experience.  I love the controls, it’s easy to play/pause and adjust volume on the headphones themselves, for me it’s very frustrating to have to go to my device to pause or adjust volume – so good functionality is a must here me.  These connect very quickly to my device and have great range.  With other headphones I would be able to tell which room in the house I left my device in based on when the Bluetooth started cutting out.  With these headphones I often have no idea where I left my device because the Bluetooth doesn’t stop working, definitely a good problem to have!  The battery life is fantastic – I have them running all day when I work from home listening to the radio while I work or on standby as I use them for calls too.  I’ve never had to charge them out of necessity, I just throw them on the charger every couple of days overnight.  The sound quality is great too – I love that they get very quiet when I’m in a quiet setting and don’t need them very loud, a vast difference from other headphones I’ve had that just don’t have those lower volume settings.

903327,5,This Watch Uses The FitCloud Pro App,"I'm new to smart watches but wanted to try one with my Android phone.  I wasn't looking for a lot of features as even with pricier smart watches, I would take all the health data with a big grain of salt (i.e. heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen).  I wanted a smart watch for more simple things like date/time and select push notifications.<br /><br />I'm not using any of the sport trackers but it also tracks steps and has a drink water or 'move' reminders.  There's also a camera integration feature to let you shake the watch to take selfies (on a 3 second timer).<br /><br />The sleep tracker is interesting to me to see that data.<br /><br />Of course, one that's nice looking with lots of digital faces that can be swapped in was also important.  I chose Lige as they had multiple models on Amazon and seem to be a reputable smart watch manufacturer.<br /><br />This watch exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is good but the charger could be better designed so it stays put better.<br /><br />The watch uses a 22mm wide strap so my photo has an aftermarket strap but the two that this came with the watch are fine and can do the job.<br /><br />From the product photos on Amazon, it looked like the bezel was its own physical object but it's really the numbers under the glass.  The glass edge is angled but it's a solid smooth surface.  I was hoping it was its own bezel but it looks fine.<br /><br />I also tried another smart watch from Lige using the DaFit app.  There are way more watches that use DaFit over FitCloud Pro.  On Android, DaFit is 10MM+ downloads and FitCloud Pro is 1MM+ but for me, I find FitCloud Pro to be better as I could select each app that I wanted push notifications for on the watch whereas with DaFit, they had a list of popular apps but I wasn't able to select specific apps like Teams or Slack.<br /><br />So, besides looking at the hardware, do some homework on the app that the watch will use.  Sadly, not all watch listings disclose the app that the watch uses or you have to read the entire description to find the name of the app.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Ucq8Gn4vL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Ucq8Gn4vL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Ucq8Gn4vL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bWl1UyWwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bWl1UyWwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bWl1UyWwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vYAS45edL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vYAS45edL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vYAS45edL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BR3R86JQ,B0BR3PL8G3,AGQTPC7LTI4WSKIPCMRSBL75RQRQ,2023-01-25 04:37:35.146,0,True,495
642792,4,Lasted one month... (update) but failed for an unexpected reason.,"Ok, decided to tear it open as it was ""heavier"" on one side.  It had two dummy plastic spacers in place of some actual cells.  Now this isn't a problem as the pack is stated 2200 mah and should have been 14.8 volts so 4 cells is correct.  (edit) The cell voltages were tested and I suspected them being of very low quality.  I tested each one and the voltages were all over the place (the BMS obviously gave up trying and failed the pack).  I had one at 1.9v, one at 2.3v, another at 3.6v and one at a flat 1 volt.  Anything below 3 volts is basically dead for a lithium ion battery.  2.5 volts is considered over discharge-cutout.  Maybe I got a bad one.<br /><br />(update a few days later)... ok, had some free time and was looking for a battery to replace a failed 18650 in a wine opener.  So decided maybe one of the cells in this month old laptop battery may suffice so cleaned them off and put them in my Cadex battery analyzer... oops - I may have jumped the gun on the quality of the cells specifically in my review above.  These were in a severally mismatched and overdischarged state when I opened the battery pack, I assumed that like most of these cheap packs online, the cells were ""C"" grade at best.  It really is rare that a BMS fails since they are far cheaper to make than the batteries so, tend to be commodities.  In this case, the pack did fail due to the BMS, it simply failed and let the cells go out of balance and overcharge/discharge.  The cells, very surprisingly, were apparently good quality.  They came back from the dead (a feat in itself), and conservatively passed their ratings.  Low ESR, averaged over 2350mah (2200 rated) each, with two over 2400mah, all tested at IEEE .2c rates.  So, the batteries were good, the failure was electronic.  Honestly I am surprised, as it is ""almost always"" the batteries/cells that get cheaped out on.  I changed my rating, increased as it appears this was a manufacturing defect, not a quality control or fake advertised, issue.",[],B08QV4Q1KD,B08QV4Q1KD,AHWXVYLM2N5H6RFZO6LDGPRCAF3A,2023-02-25 19:02:31.481,0,True,495
73037,5,Solid tube on a budget,"I'm a photographer with gear acquisition syndrome for lights, especially RGB ones. I've been eyeing some of the brand name tubes for a while, but ordered this one hoping it would perform similarly. And I've been pleasantly surprised. In the hand, it is very well built and does feel like one of those ""premium"" brands. And there are nice little touches that, to me, make it stand out from similar products at a similar price point. Things like magnetic mounts, rubber ends (rather than just plastic), the aluminum housing, etc. The battery remaining estimate seems to be pretty spot on and is a feature I can't believe I lived without; all of my other lights just say ""60% remaining"", this one says ""2hr 11min"".<br /><br />For output, it's about what you'd expect. I'd love to say it blows me away with the amount of light it produces, but that wouldn't be accurate. It's not dim by any means, but really does need to be right next to whatever you're shooting to really be effective as more than an accent. For those folks using it for models and product photography, this will really hit the mark. For those of us that shoot portraits, the 1' version of this product is just enough to act as an accent or fill, not a key. Especially at fully saturated colors where you're only using one or two of the emitter sets inside.<br /><br />Control from the onboard menu is super intuitive and after only a couple weeks of use, I'm almost getting to the point where I don't even need to look at the buttons to get where I want. The multiple parameters per preset (HSI for colors, as an example, rather than just output and color) are really powerful. I don't use the app because I don't like too many 3rd party apps on my phone, but have never felt lacking without.<br /><br />I will complain that I miss the days of removable batteries so you can charge and use at the same time. The USB-C input does allow for, essentially, continuous use, but it's not truely wireless<br /><br />Absolutely no diode imaging in the lens. I have been considering ordering a couple of the 2' lengths to use in photos/video as special effects.

710679,5,Way cheaper than Bose! Try them!!,"I recently purchased these sunglasses. I removed everything from the box and they powered on quickly. 0HO Sunshine popped up in my Bluetooth. There was nothing else I needed to do to connect them.<br /><br />Right away I listened to some music and it sounded pretty good. As other reviewers have said the base is not strong but I don’t particularly like a strong base anyways.<br /><br />Then I put on a podcast. You can tell when a professional podcaster are speaking directly into the microphone. You can hear very well. When they are talking to a “guest” who may be calling into the show, the guest’s voice sounded a little bit softer. I also tried them while I had a fan on in my home to see if I could hear over the noise of the fan. I could.<br /><br />Here’s what I will say about the volume and other people hearing what you’re listening to… At about 25% volume I can hear faintly (but not exact words) across the room.  I have to crank it up to over 75% to really hear it as someone else would say of you were walking down the street. I don’t think anybody could really hear all of the lyrics and exactly what you are listening to.<br /><br />As for a phone call, I would feel comfortable taking a phone call, but I would not have the volume all the way up so others could hear what I was saying… of course if I was walking by myself, no one could really hear anyway, but for example, if you were around a lot of people, and you want to complete 100% privacy than that would not be guaranteed wearing the sunglasses.<br /><br />All in all I think they are a great purchase for $32! I could literally by 10 pair of these sunglasses for the price of one pair of Bose sunglasses. The frame is a lightweight plastic I think if you were very rough or dropped them you would have a problem. But at this price point, I am not concerned about them lasting longer than a year. These are definitely worth a shot!

753314,1,AIWORTHLESS for podcasts,"I use MP3 players to listen to podcasts while I work or at the gym. This thing is USELESS to me<br /><br />1. It's not touchscreen, even though it says it is. It has buttons that guide navigation, and the buttons are on the screen<br /><br />2. The buttons are alternatively far too sensitive (forward and back) or almost completely dead (play/pause, on/off), making navigation and unending nightmare<br /><br />3. The above two points are pretty much moot because the ultra shiny reflective screen makes it impossible to read the screen unless you're literally in the dark<br /><br />4. If someone is talking to you while you're listening, good luck. Can't just hit one button to pause...need to hit on/off several times to illuminate the buttons, then it takes usually 5 or 6 taps at play/pause to make it actually pause.<br /><br />5. most of the time, it doesn't bookmark, meaning if you're midway through a podcast, if you stop and this sack of crap turns off, you need to fast forward back to where you were<br /><br />6. for no reason at all, when user unplugs aux jack, the screen will illuminate, usually resulting in an unwanted skip to the prior or next song due to the extremely sensitive nature of those buttons<br /><br />7. despite what they say, YOU CANNOT IMPORT PLAYLISTS. have to assemble playlists within the device, which is a very slow and clunky process. also you are stuck with their laughably useless names playlist 1, playlist 2 and playlist 3, which cannot be changed.<br /><br />8. volume maxes out at an absurdly low level.<br /><br />9. good luck getting the bluetooth to work at all<br /><br />10. sometimes it just wont power on unless you depress on/off for 30 seconds<br /><br />11. instructions are useless and nothing more than circular prose translating to haha i got your money, sucker<br /><br />and i consider myself lucky because the battery life of my unit is pretty good<br /><br />I FEEL SCAMMED BY AMAZON as they featured this piece of trash as a ""TOP SELLER"".",[],B08CVR9PVS,B08CVR9PVS,AEQGEUIY2ZORQY7TDRNVSPTEGLPA,2023-03-29 19:44:50.260,0,False,495
519142,4,It is not usb c.,"To preface I bought 6.6ft usb C cables with the device since it says in the info section that it comes with its own usb c cables.<br /><br />But that had to be a typo on their behalf, it uses micro usb, so wasted my money on those cables.<br /><br />I'm using the screen as a secondary monitor, it does, support 1920x1080, but it's native resolution is much better since you can still read text. I put discord full screen at native and it's perfect size, easy to read.<br /><br />The lack of color range  shows on static images<br />But it still looks decent enough, and on youtube videos or other casual viewing it doesn't bother me. The color settings work well to get a desired white. I was able to get close to my other monitor as to not be jarring when looking at whites between both screens.<br /><br />Blacks are probably some of the worst I've seen on an IPS, but that's expected with its low contrast ratio.<br /><br />There is, what I assume is the backlight bleeding through the top of the shell, but it's not distracting. But on the viewing area of the screen it's a uniform dark Grey.<br /><br />This stand only has one angle, but it fits for my purpose. But if you have a weird arrangement or want more control you'll need a third party tablet mount, a Vesa mount would probably be a bit overkill.<br /><br />The review might sound negative, but it's more to temper expectations, but it's otherwise a good small monitor, if you prefer to have a smaller screen on your desk to watch youtube while doing other tasks or have a program like discord in constant view so you don't miss anything. I personally don't need a 15-24in screen to benefit from the second display. It's built for a purpose and it satisfies those conditions.<br /><br />edit:<br /><br />I setup the touch screen with Windows 11 and its really awesome, it works like a smart phone touch  screen and you can use its touch screen to interact with windows or apps on the monitor while keeping your mouse cursor where it is on your main monitor.  So you can tap on the chat box in discord to type without having to move your cursor over to it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TFAieaOhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TFAieaOhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TFAieaOhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07L6WT77H,B0B4W1TMNL,AG264H6KD4UHNJJAYGELVDXXOIFQ,2023-01-06 05:45:02.390,3,True,495
890874,5,Best lap desk on the market!,"I’ve spent over a decade trying to find the perfect products for a laptop lap desk and a book stand so I can do my homework in comfort. This product does both and it’s better than any other lap desk or book stand I’ve ever bought. I bought a black Mind Reader lap desk a couple years ago to keep in my car for use wherever I went without worrying about it getting dirty. It’s held up great and still looks exactly the same. It’s got a set of cushions on the bottom that angle the lap desk towards you without the usual legs most other lap desks have (which can dig into your thighs after a while). The surface lifts opens like a trash can lid, and underneath it adjusts so you can hold whatever you’re reading at a specific angle. This is nice when you’re positioning a laptop to be more ergonomic. It also has a ledge so whatever you’re reading doesn’t fall off. The ledge is sturdy enough to hold just about anything you might want to read. As you can see in my pictures, you can use it to hold small books if you have a book clip so you don’t have to tire your hands out holding it (especially important if you’re also typing), but it also holds dense thousand-page books, large hardcover textbooks, and 2-inch filled binders. I only have two sizes of laptops, so I can only confirm for sure that it can handle up to 15-inch laptops. I absolutely love this product and use it regularly. I highly recommend it for college students and those who work from home. I do wish is that the cushions and the base they’re attached to came in different colors (just like the surface lid does). I also wish the cushions were removable, machine washable, and replaceable as I know that some day they will get dirty or start to fall apart and you can’t put this in the washing machine or switch them out for new ones. Once they go bad, I’ll just have to toss the whole product. Who knows if this seller will still have these in stock by then. I hope so as I’d like to always keep at least one in my office.<br /><br />Don’t bother with other lap desks.

246328,5,Extraordinarily Extravagant,"[[VIDEOID:84a4036d9b8a0ad99d2e1e6b9f7c0a6f]] I had the older SL120s installed previously before these were released since the Lian Li Galahad AIO came with them so I ordered 3 more to fill up the case. My rear exhaust fan started dying so I decided to replace all of them with the infinity fans.<br /><br />As far as performance specs go, the numbers are out there for your own viewing pleasure if you want to get into specifics but I won't bother doing so. There are many fans out there that would be better bang for your buck if you wanted pure performance. While these are no slouch in the cooling department, the main reason you're even thinking of buying these is how nice they look and how easy they are to install.<br /><br />Looks are great, as expected from the amount of visuals they crammed into 1 fan. If you're not wanting the gaudiness of it then you have the option of turning off lights or choosing the SL120s or something to keep the ease of daisychain.<br /><br />The fans themselves come packaged with peel off covers over all mirrored sections to protect them during shipping. The connection/daisychain method is just as easy as the SL120 though in a different location on the fan(centered instead of to the side).<br /><br />The fan hubs for these are NOT the same as the ones for the SL120 so if you're replacing those in your system you will have to remove the old hubs to install the ones that come with the infinity fans. In a fresh build this isn't a problem but if caught unaware, replacing these in an older build may take more time than anticipated. The fan hub also requires 2 15pin SATA connections so make sure you have the space for it.<br /><br />These are definitely not a mandatory item for your build as the main appeal is aesthetics but it is nice that they also do not skimp on performance. The price tag is also fairly substantial; you could buy other fans that perform the same for less money but I knew what I was getting into before purchase.<br /><br />Overall I'd give it more like a 4.5/5 but that's really only because I wish the Lconnect3 software had more LED pattern options.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zyN-hQTqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zyN-hQTqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zyN-hQTqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B4SKMYJT,B0C3L47PLK,AHVAI3FCHXPPQAIDFNDWIDS734RA,2023-04-06 05:24:06.385,3,True,495

As it is right now, it sticks directly out from the wall. It would be nice if there was an option for the cord to be set at a 90 degree angle, which would save space if the plug is placed behind an item of furniture.

The included mounting plate was very nice and appreciated, as were the extra screws and plugs.<br />-I experienced no issues setting the camera up on my wifi, the application worked well in this.<br />-The usb cable was long enough to reach, but as I mentioned before, a usb plug that allows a 90 degree input so that the cable starts flush with the wall would be a great boon.<br /><br />Operation<br />-The camera functioned well. I found no issues with the baby monitoring system, nor the night vision upon my testing.<br />-The talk through function worked as expected<br />-The listening function worked well.<br />-The biggest issue I had was with the pan/tilt function.<br />-There is a noticeable lag when utilizing this function, which makes it hard to set up exactly where you want the camera to point to. My suggestion would be to put in two ""scroll wheels"" within the app, one for vertical movement and one for horizontal movement, for fine tuning the turning. It would be nice to have markers on the scroll wheels (like degrees of turning) to remember settings in the future.<br />-The camera itself worked well when moving about. It was smooth and experienced no issues.<br /><br />Overall Impression<br />-It is a good little camera that just needs a few adjustments.

301331,3,Interesting but disappointing as well,"It's a great concept.  It's basically a high end laptop without a display or keyboard/trackpad.<br /><br />The instructions are sparse.  They show tiny BIOS screens you can't read and provide minimal information.  They show you the BIOS, but don't tell you how to access it.  The BIOS itself is a cluttered mess and doesn't really provide much guidance compared to modern BIOS's I've used on other platforms.<br /><br />It's got shiny, in the form of LED lights under the top cover and a bit of software is included that will allow you to configure those lights to some degree.  The software indicates it can control a keyboard, but there's no indication of which brand of keyboard you may need for this.<br /><br />Benchmarking leads to the conclusion that it's not making the most of the ram.  There is no XMP mode in the bios.  The system does report there are two extra ram slots available.<br /><br />Interestingly, it included additional SSD drive mounting hardware indicating you could put an 2.5"" SSD into it for extra storage.  However, there is absolutely no instruction on what what to do with this hardware.  I did attempt to open the unit by removing the four visible and very tiny screws on the bottom, but got no further in getting the unit apart to look inside.<br /><br />The fan is loud.  46db loud.  You'd want this mounted under a desk so as to minimize that noise.<br /><br />The lack of any USB ports on the front of the unit means it's not for anyone that regularly needs to plug in thumb drives or other peripherals.  You'll need to install a separate hub if you want convenience.<br /><br />It's responsive to use, snappy, and seems to do a fine job, but the noise, inconvenience factors, and lack of instructions make this a very questionable product.<br /><br />The two sticks of ram currently sell for $42 each as I write this and the internal NVME card can be found on Alibaba for $18.<br /><br />For what it offers, it seems overpriced and inconvenient.  I also really expect XMP to be available for any modern computer people will be using for gaming.<br /><br />I'd give this one a pass.",[],B0BTWW2X2D,B0C6MVC79S,AFFXIZKOES6V5R3WQ66AT5EJQUDA,2023-03-15 12:23:55.909,0,False,495
776511,5,These swabs make sensor cleaning easy and safe.,"I found that using these sensor cleaning sticks to clean my Canon 70D sensor was a lot less stressful than my previous technique of using a piece of lens cleaning pad folded over the end of a plastic paddle. While some may consider these to be somewhat expensive, cleaning your sensor is probably not something you should need to do very often and anything that makes the process go smoothly is worth the price.<br /><br />It's important to make sure that a DSLR has a charged battery to prevent the mirror from attempting to close during lockup while you are in the middle of the cleaning procedure. And before using the swabs to do any wiping the sensor should be vigorously blown off with a rubber bulb blower. It will also help to have very good lighting on the face of the sensor before proceeding.<br /><br />The instructions say that you should apply 1-2 drops of fluid to the swab.  Waiting a few seconds will allow the entire edge of the swab to become wet. Then gently drag the swab from one edge to the other (I always use left to right) and in doing so you should see that the sensor face is wetted but then dries almost immediately as you drag the swab.<br /><br />After this first pass I do deviate from the instructions a little however. Instead of making a reverse pass over the sensor I flip the swab and make another left to right pass (or the same direction as the first pass). This way any dust that is pulled off the surface either comes off with the swab or worst case stays on the right edge of the sensor.<br /><br />Cleanliness of the sensor can be confirmed by taking the normal diffused light frames to look for dark spots, and repeating the procedure if necessary.<br /><br />To maximize the use out of a pad I sometimes take the opportunity to use it over again to clean any filters (a much less critical use) before disposing of the swab.  I have used this on expensive 2"" narrowband astronomical filters by re-wetting any unused edge of the swab and wiping the filter in a circular spiral starting at the center and working outward.<br /><br />These are not at all expensive considering that the proper pads and fluids for cleaning by other methods add up in price as well. These swabs make the job easy and safe.  Recommended with 5 stars.",[],B0BCK5CB42,B0BQLRBF2P,AH4K2USV745EQMXZRXSPAPSVHWAA,2023-01-18 15:02:53.721,0,False,494
889552,2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes. I bought this tv because I have a PS5 and because I trust Sony quality. I was upgrading from a $400 LG I had bought back in 2018. When you first set it up there's definitely a wow factor, but once you realize most of that is from the over saturation, over sharpening, ai processing, etc, and you actually calibrate the TV the wow is kind of just a ""nice"". Then the sound quality... Obviously if I want good sound I should have actual speakers, but the sound was just so... underwhelming from the TV. Muffled, no bass, flat. I played around with the settings and the best i could get it at was metallic sounding. The software is terrible. I love Google TV. I used a Chromecast with Google TV on my LG. However, that $50 Chromecast running Android 12 could run circles around this $1700 TV running Android 10. The tv software was slowly as can be. Slow to get from menu to menu. Slow to launch apps. And yes I was running the most up to date firmware. Then there's the apps. You have the play store which is great. Apple TV comes preloaded but the app doesn't work. You can't uninstall it, only uninstall updates and disable it. Tried that, followed by enabling. Tried clearing it's cache and data. Nothing. The only way I could get apple tv was by side loading the apk, then it worked. Then there are the weird quirks like not wanting to turn on. Sometimes the TV just refuses to turn on. No response from the remote, no response from the power button on the TV. The light is on, and it registers that a button is being pushed on the remote, but nothing happens. You have to unplug it from the power for a few seconds and plug it back in and then it lets you turn it on. Sometimes it turns on, in it's own, in the middle of the night. We've been woken up by a YouTube video resuming out of nowhere on the TV after we've turned the TV off. Creepy to say the least.<br /><br />Just... Don't buy this TV. Even with all this said the TV is ""fine"". But I couldn't deal with all of it and ended up returning the TV because i didn't pay all the money for fine.",[],B09R95MBQN,B0B5LWJT92,AGYV5TSZ554XUYZ6A4PJHVRHT3PA,2023-04-20 08:36:58.469,1,True,494
334681,5,Exactly what I wanted/needed,"For a couple of years I've been on a quest to find an small, light, ultra portable computer that I would actually take with me. I wanted to avoid that subconscious bias that it would be too bulky and I wouldn't be using it that day anyway. I tried a few and settled on a Surface Go because it runs MS:Word and Scrivener and I couldn't play games on it.<br /><br />Now I had to find a bag. Something just big enough to carry the computer and the various cords and accessories, but not big enough that I would weigh it down with extra junk that would trigger that subconscious bias and make it too bulky.<br /><br />This bag fits the bill perfectly. It fits the Surface Go with plenty of room left over so it will work with a slightly bigger ultra portable.<br /><br />In the main pocket I have enough room for the Surface Arc Mouse, Moleskin notepad, various pens, ear pods, power cable, hub, various other cables, a pack of tissues and some cinnamon gum. There is a special pocket for a thumb drive so you don't have to dig down under all those cables to find it. I also wrote my name in phone number on the lining inside the pocket with a sharpie in case someone finds it. There is some padding on the front of the main pocket as well so all that junk is a little protected too.<br /><br />There is another pocket small pocket on the front, with enough room to put a small instruction manual and an Apple Air Tag. That is everything I would need to have with me under pretty much any circumstance except a portable battery which I wouldn't include because of heavy they are. YOU could put a portable battery in there if you didn't have as many misc. cables as I have. Again, for me it's the art of keeping it light.<br /><br />In conclusion the bag is small, but big enough to carry what you'd need to have with your ultra portable. It's light and well made. The cons are, the 'Case Logic look' is a bit dated, but some of that is form following function. Also the strap doesn't have one of those padded bits on it, but to be fair its so light you don't need one. Note: I took the tissues and gum out for the picture so you could see the rest better.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81CJcrkzkfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81CJcrkzkfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81CJcrkzkfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B002STX2ZG,B0CDLVKXF7,AEDVMMMAFCNCYHMSHNKNYDXSOI7Q,2023-05-04 03:05:35.180,0,True,494
938755,2,First headphones with a bass (like the fish) EQ setting,"Right out of the package, these headphones are beautiful.  I love the rose gold & white color combination.<br /><br />I was able to pair the headphones with my iPhone 14 Pro quickly and easily.  That’s when the problems started.  Specifically:<br /><br />1. The headphones are NOT comfortable.  I have big ears, but I can usually find a comfortable setting with any of the almost 20 pairs of headphones I own.  My ears kept hitting the inside mesh.  The ear cup cushions didn’t maintain any distance between my ears and the plastic speaker cover.<br /><br />2.  The headphones feel really light and cheap.  The plastic creaks and groans incessantly.  I’m afraid to touch them for fear of breaking the cheap plastic.<br /><br />3.  The headphones come with a 3 foot long cable with 1/8” jacks on each end in case you wanted to use them in wired mode (without Bluetooth).  This is not long enough to connect to a laptop on a desk or a handheld device unless you plan to hold it or keep it in a shirt pocket.<br /><br />4.  The controls don’t work correctly.  The + and - buttons are dual function, controlling either the volume or the Prev / Next function.  Controlling the volume works.  The Prev function also works.  But the Next (+) button only pauses the music.  Even worse, hitting the next button again doesn’t restart the music.  I was never able to find any combinations of button pushes that would skip to the next track.<br /><br />5.  The EQ button runs through a list of EQ settings, including Pop, Rock, Vocal, Jazz, Bass and Classic.  The voice that announces the EQ setting pronounces “Bass” like the fish instead of the lower sound register.  Frustratingly, there’s no “flat” EQ setting.<br /><br />6.  The sound quality of the headphones is poor.  The bass is mushy, midrange is not clear, and the high end is non-existent.<br /><br />Overall, I can’t recommend these headphones.  Too many issues that even basic quality control should have easily caught.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515D4LO9ghL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515D4LO9ghL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515D4LO9ghL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JebdOqgyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JebdOqgyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JebdOqgyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CGhM8N7tL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CGhM8N7tL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CGhM8N7tL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cYmq9gl9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cYmq9gl9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cYmq9gl9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xw6cfsO7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xw6cfsO7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xw6cfsO7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BMLXSNG8,B0C5DH1ZC2,AFT4NU3YNW5CSLIXNQLOPBXXKWEQ,2023-01-08 21:08:37.617,3,False,494

While the 17-cn2099nr is not a gaming powerhouse, I found that it handled most of the games in my Steam library well enough to provide for a decent gaming environment.  The limiting factor with games that I experienced was with 8MB ram, at least 16MB would have been more welcome.  The 17.3"" monitor has plenty of real estate for browsing and viewing media.  The disappointing aspect of this monitor is that its limited to 1600 x 900 resolution.  In today's environment of 4K gaming and media, this is a bit of a let down that we don't even get 1080p.  In practical application, I only occasionally notice that the image is not quite as sharp as my laptop that has a 1080p screen.<br /><br />Other than the monitor resolution, there was one other thing that was disappointing about the 17-cn2099nr.  That is the USB-C port.  The port does not support monitors or charging.  This limits the utility of a docking station.  A docking station will give you an ethernet port and additional USB ports, but you will not be able charge the laptop or use it to connect to an additional monitor.<br /><br />The two negatives aside, overall, this is a great value laptop.

472045,5,Actually holds up my ultrawide curved OLED pretty dang well!,"Now, the single ""negative"" before I get more into it. My ultrawide (AW3423DW, a very overpriced monitor I was very nervous about mounting the entire time because boy I don't think warranty covers ""screwed up attaching an arm mount"") does tilt down ever so slightly with this, even with tightening it the tension as tight as I physically could with both arms while wearing gloves and getting as much leverage as I could.<br /><br />That said, the ""tilt"" is maybe a couple of degrees and I literally can't even tell while I'm looking at the screen. We're not talking those cheap mounts where your monitor is looking at the floor or something. It's VERY slight. But I know it might bother someone so I'm noting it. The only reason I even notice is because I can tell my second monitor is slightly straighter as they sit next to each other.<br /><br />I'd have included images, but my desk is still such a mess (I have a very unusual desk with no back lip, luckily this comes with clamps AND grommet options so I was able to spend 5 seconds drilling a hole!) due to me being kind of unprepared to rearrange my entire desk. But I have a 34 inch Ultrawide curved display and a standard 16:9, 27-inch, which for the record doesn't tilt even a bit.<br /><br />Setup was super easy. You attach it bit by bit instead of all at once (not sure how other arms do it, I've seen mounts in person but this is the first I've owned), so finding the perfect spot is very easy. They've got a wide range of motion, both horizontally, vertically, they tilt easily, etc. The tension adjustments worked great.<br /><br />This has freed up an ENORMOUS amount of desk space! While modern monitor stands are... kind of low profile, they often come with two long prongs that, despite not taking up a lot of space per prong, just make a large portion of your desk unusable for much of anything. This is much lower profile, and the ability to just push both my monitors up and out of the way so I can use my desk as a desk is something I never knew I needed.<br /><br />I highly recommend these arms, I'm very pleased with them.",[],B0BVGQJWFQ,B0BXFMBJJT,AFAFSRXV7PCO6WRYMZRANVFBWQZA,2023-03-03 16:52:31.090,1,False,494
225639,5,They do the job for what I needed,"I'll be honest, I loose technology....often. As a result I never bought expensive earbuds. I would always buy the $30 and under option because inevitably I was going to misplace them and could not stomach the idea of loosing a $100 item within a few weeks of purchase. However after 3 years of COVID required zoom calls my coworkers chipped in and bought me the Google pixel buds. There was an immediate difference for me in regards to what I could hear and the experience for anyone talking to me on the other side. Here are the highlights<br /><br />1. The noise cancellation works well. In the past people would complain they can't hear me clearly because of all the background noise. As if I were at a construction site when I simply was opening a bag of chips!<br /><br />2. Sound quality is perfect. Can't tell you how many times with other earbuds I would be told can you get closer to the phone, or that I sounded far away, or was I underwater etc etc. But with these it's Crystal clear no issues at all.<br /><br />3. Battery lasts long enough. I find that these last most of my work day. I tend to average about five hours of meetings a day and in that capacity they last.<br /><br />4. Charge speed is quick. When I do need to charge these for from 0-100% in like 20mins. To be fair I don't think I have ever let them get to 0. Overall I don't find myself charging them often and the charging case really does do a good job of charging the actual buds quickly if I do run into a problem.<br /><br />5. Ear buds do slip out. I have found an occasion that a slight tap will accidentally send the earbuds falling out of my ear. I've changed the size of the ear cushion but doesn't really seem to lock in well like other earbuds I have tried. So that is one point off for them but nothing insurmountable that would detract from the overall score.<br /><br />Overall for the price I think these are great. So much so that I did in fact lose the ones my coworker bought me within about 6 weeks and ended up buying my own pair thankfully they were on sale.

I bought a relatively high spec Omen (30l, RTX 3080, i9-10900K) back in November 2021 and it was great until reliability issues started to creep up late last year. The system would freeze (no blue screen but the screen would freeze and audio would hang) which would require a hard reboot. This happened when playing current gen demanding games. I talked to their support rep. and they had me ship it back for repairs under warranty.<br /><br />The repair procedure went smoothly and was quick, so no complaints there. HP replaced the GPU and everything seemed to be working fine. That was up until last night when playing The Last of US Part 1. This game is like a GPU/CPU stress test as all fans are very audible while playing. After starting from a saved game the power to the system just shut off like it was unplugged all of a sudden. I checked all cables and nothing had shifted or had moved (I have the tower sitting on my desktop). Tried unplugging the power cable, holding the power button for 10 seconds, and plugging it back in. Nothing. The system is effectively dead and I am out of warranty. I am almost positive the PSU died.<br /><br />I have built many PCs over the years but bought this prebuilt as it was very difficult to find a 3-series Nvidia GPU at the time of purchase, so I went for this Omen. I am very disappointed as two major components had issues in the &lt;1.5 years I have owned the system: GPU and PSU. The GPU was replaced under warranty but I'll have to pay for a replacement PSU out of pocket. Based on my experience, these are not reliable.

Most phone chargers only make this sound when the device is fully charged, this cord emits the sound about 5 minutes after being plugged in, and continues until being unplugged. It‘s very annoying.<br /><br />These cords have the normal USB end (instead of the usb-c) and can plug into the normal USB ports, so that’s a bonus.<br /><br />I did find a charger that doesn’t make the whining sound when fully charged, and that is: https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Charger-GEONAV-Lightning-Charging/dp/B0B5L6QHMZ?<br />It has two cords and one USB-C charging block that both cords can plug into.

750865,5,Good safe chargers.,"I own an iPhone 13 Pro and an older iPad.  I am always looking for chargers that will charge them faster and at the same time be safe.  I saw these and asked Amazon to test them.<br /><br />There are sites on the internet that speak about the possible dangers of rapid chargers for iPhones.  From what I read it appears that some can overheat your battery, which degrades it faster.  I am not an expert and some may disagree.  I tend to believe it based on some of the sources I have read.<br /><br />My wife has a Puregear charger.  It is faster than these chargers but it really heats up the phone in a short time.  I used the Puregear charger for this review and it added about 20% more battery power than these chargers in a 9-minute time period.  It varied a little depending on how low a charge the phone had.  I tested them several times. The phone does not seem to heat up much with these chargers.  Although, the converter box that plugs into the electrical outlet does get a little warm.<br /><br />The website says that when the phone is charged at 80% these chargers automatically go into something it calls ""smart stack tickle mode.""  It says it prolongs the battery on your phone.  I am guessing that it slows down the charging process as it nears charging the phone, which the site says is to prevent ""overcharging.""<br /><br />There is one minor problem with the USB-C connector on the connecting cord. See photo.  When I travel abroad I like to take as few chargers and converters as possible.  I have a universal adapter that will accommodate up to 3 USB plugs.  See photo.  I can't bring this cord unless I bring the converter itself because my adapter doesn't have a USB-C slot.  This is certainly not something major but you need to keep it in mind when packing.<br /><br />Overall I like these converters.  It is great that they are MFI certified.  I had no problem hooking them up to either my phone or iPad.  They charged both quickly compared to just using a USB slot.  Looking at prices they are a little bit more expensive than some of the other similar chargers but the difference is not much.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/416fhAobG0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/416fhAobG0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/416fhAobG0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zxMU5JGhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zxMU5JGhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zxMU5JGhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BLP78WW6,B0BVM34FH8,AELFIGI7EAXMF44CFOIH67WVXZ6Q,2023-03-22 02:16:12.472,0,False,494

675450,4,"Definitely easier to crimp than average, but a bit fiddly and wildly expensive","I had a build project where I needed to crimp a ton of connectors in short notice, so the promise of a faster solution held a lot of appeal.  This isn't a bad product, but I see it as designed for a very specific purpose:  rapidly crimping keystone jacks when you don't have a solid surface to work with.  The crimping tool is nicely made and can crimp these while held in your hand.  But the process is a little fiddly, still.<br /><br />To crimp, you need to:<br /><br />1- strip the wire and untwist all the ends.  So far, the same as a regular jack.  You also need to add some metal shielding tape, included.<br />2- Pull the wires out and nestle them in the various channels.  There's a color guide for A and B, which is nice.  What's not nice is the cables fall out of their channels unless you use the included punchdown tool or your fingernail or something.  So much for ""easier"" - twisting them into their channels was an exercise in frustration.<br />3- Crimp.  You'll need to remove the top metal shield for this - the instructions make it super non-obvious and it isn't immediately apparent that it's removable and not hinged.  On the plus side, rad blades come up from the sides to cut off the excess wire in one step, so that's cool.<br />4 - Put a termination block over top of your wires, then cover it with the metal shell you set aside.<br />5 - IMHO, the worst part of this whole kit:  add a zip tie to hold the cover on.  Why is this not a snap-to-fit piece?  Having to get out my nippy cutters to cut off the ziptie end defeats the whole purpose of a rapid tool, and the zip tie makes the finished product look unprofessional and amateurish.<br /><br />So... it's a bit shorter than a normal keystone jack, but only by a few moments.  For that time savings, you pay a huge cost premium - make sure to look at the consumable costs before springing for this tool set, because I don't find the costs to be reasonable given the modest time savings involved.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DXH+plPfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DXH+plPfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DXH+plPfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dkNh6kbYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dkNh6kbYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dkNh6kbYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dznZsYs7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dznZsYs7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dznZsYs7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81efevWNy4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81efevWNy4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81efevWNy4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09LX3FGCH,B0C5YHPG2J,AEYVHXUGFAOYN75P5FPXPZCHF3CQ,2023-03-23 07:10:35.305,0,False,494
115972,5,Solid mid-market camera security setup!,"There's so much to this I fully suggest reading all the listing content, watch the video and head to the manufacturer's website to get a full grip on how extensive this is.  It can easily be a one-stop solution for security because the cam can be rotated in all directions and do so thru the Wifi app.  Now being 2K is more than enough for most applications and FHD (1080p) really gives a ton of detail.  So the 2K here is nice to use and doesn't seem to overload the bandwidth but with the SD card slot you could easily store high quality video that way when needed.  The App can leave a little bit to be desired, Engerish in places and weak QA/QC can get on your nerves but you can make it all work in the end.  Doesn't seem to crash like other china-based cam systems around which is a plus.<br /><br />The housing is waterproof and weather-resistant, I'm in NE Ohio and there is no such thing as weather-proof because I've seen stuff claiming ""proof"" that was taught a new lesson.  But the cam and the solar unit are very tough and will last you for awhile.<br /><br />Nice portion is the solar panel large enough to store up a charge and run the cam continually so you don't have to put this where you could get some power wired in or have an external outlet.  This is great for anti-theft, you can mount this up in the air where it's not easily seen nor grabbed by thieves.  I don't know how many anti-theft mounts I see for the video doorbell stuff because people simply rip them out and walk with them.  Motion detection is solid, Night vision is crisp in almost any light and all round it's not bad for the buck.<br /><br />There is a service you can use is nice but as always - at a cost.  The 2.4G Wifi means no 5Ghz but then again the 2.4G is the most deployed out in the wild so you should be able to install it easily.  Now allowing others to see your cam feed isn't ever a fantastic idea in general, but if you have seniors or handicapped family you want to be able to keep a remote eye on their surroundings, etc. this work perfectly for all that.",[],B0BKRCYJKX,B0BPY6SRRG,AGSQ2TBMKE44P2VSD544HDFOSPMA,2023-01-15 20:58:42.385,3,False,494
951872,5,This USB-A Format Drive Handles Large Backups Fast,"This review is for the ORICO USB 3.2 Gen 2 standard (USSD) Flash Drive, advertised to have read and write speed up to 520MB/s.<br /><br />As anyone who has been looking can tell you, the specs for USB 3.x connectors (and therefore drives with these connectors) can be really confusing.  The packaging for this drive is labelled as a 256GB USB 3.1 Gen 2 version of a USB Solid State Flash Drive (USSD) and claims 520MB/S speed.  I tested the drive in the USB 3.1 port of my (circa 2017) Dell XPS 8930 Desktop by copying 42.7GB of backup files from the internal hard drive to the Orico Flash Drive.  This task was completed in 2.5 minutes (= 150 seconds), which equates to an average write speed of ~285MB/sec.  The fastest USB 3.0 Flash Drives I’ve tested in the last 6 months have reached peak write speeds of just 36MB/sec, so this is a noticeable improvement.  Windows 10 Task Manager showed peak write speed during this task of 365MB/sec (see photo), but this was not a constant rate; the speed throttling is likely due to the read-speed being limited by the source hard drive.<br /><br />Like most fast flash drive, Orico’s drive heats up under continuous use; their temperature graph (see photo) shows a temperature of about 35C / 95F after 2.5 minutes of operation.  They claim that this is significantly cooler than comparable USSD drives which is certainly possible.  Using a Thermal Camera, I checked my Orico drive during the 42.7GB transfer.  I found the drive to heat up to about 97F at the USB connection point while the opposite end warmed to about 82F – Noticeable heating but not too-hot-to-touch by any means and consistent with their graph.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: This Orico drive’s performance is reasonably close to what is claimed.  Even in an older desktop machine, this USB-A format Flash Drive was fast, making it a plausible choice for those who need to store larger size file backups.  At its current price point, you are paying a premium for this speed and so it will not be for everyone.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31EN+ntdZiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31EN+ntdZiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31EN+ntdZiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514FODLafcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514FODLafcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514FODLafcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WqERTYu0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WqERTYu0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WqERTYu0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71khR-nholL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71khR-nholL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71khR-nholL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91PbBNBmOLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91PbBNBmOLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91PbBNBmOLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B6W6CHX3,B0BG6YHPF2,AGTJUQ3A5QB3KSWLG4DYSG47RLOQ,2023-04-18 14:04:14.819,0,False,494

But, I don't plan to use the volume controls (the controls on the keyboard & mouse work fine with it), so for my purposes that wasn't an issue.  Just makes you wonder what else might fail.<br /><br />SLEEK:  My wife wanted speakers that looked clean and took up no real estate on her desk.  These are perfect - they almost look like they are part of the monitor.  I love the way it snugs up to the bottom of the monitor, doesn't cut into the screen at all, and leaves the DELL logo on the center bottom of the monitor unaffected.<br /><br />SIMPLE:  plug in the USB, it works.

But the manufacturer said it would work on up to 1"".  I took a chance.  This monitor is 3/4"".  It attached with no problems and a tiny bit of room to spare.<br /><br />- SOUND QUALITY:  Personally, I wouldn't be happy with these speakers because of the tinny, shallow audio.  But that's not an issue for my wife - she doesn't listen to anything where quality audio is important to her.  For her, the sleekness and simplicity were top of her want list.  Personally I'd say they were a very small step up from laptop speakers.

132523,5,Buy it,"I recently had to shoot a music video and the venue would not allow us to use haze (even canned haze “Atmosphere Aerosol”, which doesn’t set off smoke alarms). I planned on only getting the Smoque 1 to give the appearance of haze in the room, but I needed next day delivery and this Smoque 2 was the only option. It was about $20 or $30 more and not the correct filter size for my lens (not if I wanted next day delivery). I almost didn’t get it. I found two filter step down rings for between $8 and $11 each, and ordered the filter. I used the filter with a cine lens and also a Canon 50mm.<br /><br />The effect is subtle, you won’t lose any clarity or sharpness in most areas, it doesn’t color the image in any way. It does smooth out some contrast slightly, but you’ll mostly notice the change in lighting. Much like how haze will catch light and make it bloom, this really does that. So depending on how strong you want the bloom, that’s going to decide on how strong of the filter to buy: 1, 2 or 3. I’m actually very happy with the 2, and glad I didn’t get the 1.<br /><br />The light bloom can be overwhelming if you have too much light in a dark scene: we had stage lights from left and right and they would wash out 2/3s of the frame with colored glowing light. But we actually liked the effect, it was almost like using light leaks. As the lights were moving around and this wasn’t constant, it wasn’t a problem for our shoot, it added a lot of interest to the shot. What I really like is when things reflect light such as dust particles in the air or furniture, the bloom is small and makes them kind of glow without making them too obvious. Gives it a real film feel.<br /><br />This is pretty similar in effect to a black pro mist filter, but probably a bit stronger in how much glow you get from light sources. But considering I thought for sure it would be too strong and would have to return it, I was surprised to how perfect for me it is and how excited I am to use it again.",[],B001U88BT8,B0067HXY6W,AHI2JCT4QVCJLQICAO64CYXQ3NVQ,2023-02-27 16:55:50.951,0,True,494

So far, the batteries have lasted over a month with seldom use a few times each week. Power meter still shows full bars, that's some great standby time considering my apprehension once I realized these units require 4 AAA batteries each.<br />4. The battery cover was difficult to remove on one of the units but not the other one. I had to remove the clip first, and even then, I thought the battery door was going to break from all of the pressure required to remove it. The photo shows how the battery door ""grooves"" that are meant to provide grip for the user while removing the cover, are blocked by the clip.

I've been using one of their standard EF-RF adapters with the optional tripod connector and it has been great. So when I saw their control ring EF-RF adapter, I had to get one. Obviously due to the design it doesn't have a threaded hole on the bottom for a tripod connector, but instead it has a very functional fully rotatable control ring. The adapter has metal connections and the ring is knurled metal. There is a rubber gasket for some weather sealing on the RF side. Build quality is great, as expected from YKEASU.

The adapter works well with all of my EF lenses I've tried (16-35 f2.8 L II, 24-70 f2.8L, 70-200 f2.8L II, 85 f1.2L II) and the control ring does what it's supposed to do.<br /><br />I knocked a star off though because I feel like the control ring is a little stiffer than it should be at times. I contacted CS and they advised rotating the dial a couple of dozen times to help loosen the internal lubrication, in case it thickened up from cold weather. It definitely improved compared to when I first pulled it out of the box, but I still feel it could be tuned a bit better. Yes, it's easy to turn the ring when you've got all your fingers on it in a perpendicular fashion, but when you've got a lens and body attached to both ends, you're rotating the ring with your thumb and a finger or two in a parallel fashion. While shooting and holding the lens and trying to rotate the ring, the stiffness becomes even more apparent.<br /><br />All in all, YKEASU has a solid 3rd party EF-RF control ring adapter. The adapter part works well and the control ring works with the RF body (whatever you set it to do). The adapter is much more cost-effective compared to the Canon brand, but this time the tradeoff is a little more noticeable in use.",[],B0BQHJDD6X,B0BQHJDD6X,AFBHSTBMHEYFWAGKJG4UTLD3TUCA,2023-02-14 18:50:08.044,0,False,494
844536,5,"Lightweight, compact, and sturdy!","[[VIDEOID:69f27d97659ca5c45649187fa876e355]] Very impressed with this mono pod, it is small and compact, though when extended gives you plenty of reach. The wide feet on it make it very stable and the fluid head on the top is nice and smooth on all axis. Given that it is carbon fiber, it is nice and lightweight. has a nice grip material around the top and a wrist strap for extra security. The feet have a little twist lock that allows you to lock the monopod in a standing up position. Not that I would trust the monopod to stay standing on its own with my camera on it, but it’s a nice extra feature.<br /><br />The listing shows that you’re able to make a high hat out of the feet and the fluid head by removing them both from the main body of the monopod and then attaching them together. This is definitely doable, but it’s not quick as there is no fast way of detaching the fluid head and the feet other than unscrewing them… but you can do it if you need to which is nice in a pinch. The problem with this is feature is that  the feet tend to come loose from the base of the monopod easily. Not sure what to do about this, maybe put a little Loctite on it.  That would fix the issue, but then it’ll be a pain to unscrew the feet if I ever need to.🤷🏽‍♂️<br /><br />One other little annoyance about the monopod is that because it’s so compact, it has five stages of height adjustment to it, but each stage is only about 14 inches long, so to make any major height adjustments, you have to loosen, and then re-tighten multiple stages. When filming running-n-gun broll, and you need to be able to quickly adjust your angle for different shots, this can be a bit of a pain. I am using this monopod primarily for travel, where weight and size is at a premium, but for work around town, I’m keeping my other monopod with only three stages.<br /><br />A couple of small annoyances, but overall a great monopod and a solid buy.💪🏼",[],B081BBYTV2,B081BBYTV2,AG5G2T3IVXWVKHUC2IPXON466R6Q,2023-01-25 06:02:37.598,0,False,494
699946,4,Great looking case at a great price,"The good<br />- The box came with installation directions. Seems obvious for a case but instructions are always nice.<br />Clear transparent case that's virtually impossible to notice from a distance. Lets the natural good looks of the MacBook shine through.<br />- I thought the glossy finish would be a fingerprint magnet but so far I haven't noticed a lot of smudges yet.<br />- Came with keyboard cover. I generally don't like them as typing on them kills the little tactile feedback that's present on a laptop chiclet keyboard but this one is a little less annoying than other silicone ones I've had. It's a bit counterintuitive but I think it's because it's firmer than the other ones I've had that are squishier. Keep in mind the #1 killer of MacBooks is probably liquid damage so I really appreciate the keyboard cover even if I don't like it that much. The only key not covered is the fingerprint reader so if you spill soda or coffee don't do it over that key.<br />- Top cover tolerance was pretty tight so I have no worries about it coming off.<br />- Lowest price of any case I've had.<br />- It came with a nonslip microfiber cloth/mousepad<br /><br />Things I wasn't impressed with<br />- The bottom cover fit wasn't as good as the top. A light nudging of the corner would unclip a corner of the case, not enough for the case to fall off though.<br />- Some of the alignment looks a little weird but the lid closed normally. See the photos and judge for yourself.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this case is hard plastic. There is no give or cushioning anywhere, except for the 4 feet on the bottom of the case. This case would definitely protect from scuffs and scratches from going through security at the airport and being stored in a backback with a bunch of other stuff. It won't, however, protect it from repeated drops and abuse from a teenager. Whatever corner the laptop lands on will destroy the plastic for that corner but it probably will prevent your laptop from being dented. Just keep in mind that you'll likely have to get another case after that. But it's current pricing is so low that you can probably buy 2-3 spares for this eventuality at what some other cases cost.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618TIei8JmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618TIei8JmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618TIei8JmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619fCjaxDaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619fCjaxDaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619fCjaxDaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IOgHrwz8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IOgHrwz8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IOgHrwz8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ekjfunQzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ekjfunQzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ekjfunQzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hiwPqXjrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hiwPqXjrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hiwPqXjrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LoCsEBMAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LoCsEBMAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LoCsEBMAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RgQ5S2qAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RgQ5S2qAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RgQ5S2qAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09QYVF6F7,B0BCW81SZH,AFB3N2GKIAWP7BMWH3JZ3YZ7YBBA,2023-01-08 01:19:20.492,0,False,494
858380,4,Great value! Not perfect...,"For the price, this is a great great value.<br />Sturdiness and ruggedness in a stand involve the total package, not just pole diameter.  These stands have economical extension clamps and leg spread setting clamp. They are hinged with rivets and use economical spreader arms.  So these are very usable, but not for heavy use and by no means 'professional' if I'm being the judge.  They're fine here.<br />The power switch on the cord is on/off only. It does not control any brightness or color temp but the listing doesn't claim that so we're okay as long as you know that ""control by switch"" means off/on only.<br />The color temp and brightness are controlled by a remote control. Each light in the package comes with a remote but they're using the same frequencies so you can control both bulbs with one remote. That's the other thing, it's the -bulb- that is controllable, and only by remote. You do get the three advertised temperatures, and you can set brightness from off to full with up/down controls. There are some hotkeys on the remote to get you to certain settings as far as brightness and temperature quickly. They say that they are 135w draw bulbs, and therefore yielding way more than that compared to what an incandescent would. Yeah they're pretty darned bright but I don't have the meters needed to confirm any of their claims. Also... if/when these bulbs fail I have no idea what flexible replacement options might fill their role, if any...? I suppose that's no different than other LED lights where you have to replace the whole thing. At least when these fail the rest of the kit is still there.<br />This all comes in a reasonable carrying bag. The bulbs are in packing boxes so you might want to get a nice bag or something to put them in rather than a plain white cardboard box. The reflectors each come in their own separate slip bag. So once you fold them and fold their detachable front cover screens, you can stuff them in there and they stay compacted and protected.<br />I think you've got the info you need now along with what the listing says.

840320,5,Feature rich fitness/smart watch,"There are already many reviews for this generation of Samsung fitness/smart watch so I'll just hit the highlights of why I like it. First, I find the S3 to be a feature rich and stylish watch.  I very much like being able to access the watch's features using the bezel wheel.  No tapping the screen or swiping to see information if I don't choose to.  I have a Samsung phone so the watch and App were easy for me to set up and understand.  The watch's screen is bright, sharp, colorful, and there are many modifiable watch faces available.  I don't keep the GPS feature turned on so my battery life is a good 2 days.  I have tried a couple of other fitness watches over the years, some with much longer battery life, but I have mostly used a version of Fitbit watch since 2015.  Because I wanted to try something new and after watching/reading a number of reviews for this watch, I purchased a renewed one for around $100.  I have been having fun with the watch and have nothing bad to say about it except step counts and some fitness info does not match up with my Fitbit watch results. I guess I will have to calculate a fudge factor in my head for the difference.  Anyway, I liked the watch enough to buy a renewed S4 {next gen} watch that offers a few more features over the S3 such as an important new OS.  Luckily, the Samsung App allows me to enable 2 watches so I can keep 1 watch charged all the time and switch back and forth between them. Samsung has promised 4 years of software updates so I will have plenty of time with these watches to try out the Samsung ecosystem before I have to decide to move on {or not} to their next gen watch. I believe S3 support updates end the Fall of 2023.  The last thing I will say is that the $399 Samsung wanted for these premium watches brand new is way out of my cost to value price range so I was happy to be able to purchase them renewed.  The good news is that their 5th gen fitness watch is more reasonably priced.  But if you want to kick the tires on a premium Samsung fitness/smart watch without it costing an arm and a leg, I'd recommend you buy it renewed {excellent condition} to see if it just might become your new favorite watch.",[],B08HL5K8JB,B08HHSFT21,AEU6TJJZMIIC3WT5PEXP2FEIISXQ,2023-01-14 15:06:00.788,24,True,494

Keeps getting worse!,"I have used Asurion in the past for cell phones and always gotten stellar service and happy with it.<br /><br />Now comes using it for my laptop.<br /><br />Did the claim online. Didn't get any type of confirmation or anything until it finally shipped. Then I noticed the shipment was going to someone I have no idea who they are and on the opposite side of the country. I didn't find this out till I got a message it was delivered and it was not there.<br /><br />I reached out to support in chat. I was told that there was an error with the shipment of the box and they have to REDO THE WHOLE CLAIM! I was so puzzled, all of my information was correct but it was in their system there was this error. This was beyond frustrating as I had already waited countless days to get a box that never showed up. Now I was being told I had to wait another 3-5 business days for another box. I demanded it be next day shipped, this should have been a reasonable request. I am unemployed and looking for work and this laptop was all I had to do this. I was told the standard is 3-5 days.<br /><br />So here I am waiting on a box that has not taken two weeks and no closer to getting my laptop fixed. I have never had this unprofessionalism in any other claim with Asurion.<br /><br />I will update on how they handle the repair whenever it inevitably happens. Apparently the customers are now at the will of Asurion and their mistakes and have no interest in making things right.<br /><br />Update 3/18/23<br />Well it just keeps getting worse.

379173,5,"Exactly what I was looking for, and more!","I have spent hours looking for just the right product only to come up bust. This is not one of those times. I was looking for 3 things in a case/cover for my Microsoft Surface Pro 8, and I found all three in this one. And here they are:<br /><br /> 1. The back of the MSP8 is very slippery, and I was in constant fear of dropping it. Fixed! The back cover of the case (mine is clear) is grippy without being spongy, plus the substantial edge gives it a second line of defense against it slipping out of my hands.<br /><br /> 2. That edge also checked the box for making it more difficult to accidentally hit the Off/On switch when changing orientation. The button is still quite accessible but not as vulnerable. I haven't hit it accidentally since I got this cover.<br /><br /> 3. Finally, I can fold the keyboard back and use the kick stand without an unneeded front cover getting in the way like with many other cases out there.<br /><br /> 4. And fourth…. I know, I said three, but I hadn't even considered that I'd be able can detach the keyboard and walk around without clutching my MSP8 like a newborn.<br /><br /> 5. Finally, along with that, it has another feature I didn't think I would use and that is the pen holder. Now that I feel secure detaching the keyboard, I actually ended up using the pen holder.<br /><br /> 6. Okay, last unexpected benefit, honestly! The keyboard is no longer wobbly as is without the case, even when it is on my lap.<br /><br />It does add a bit of bulk and weight but that's the price of protection, isn't it? I wasn't looking for military grade protection as I don't intend to drop it out of an airplane. But I think it is plenty sturdy for my needs. Too be honest, the MSP8 has already survived one drop without a cover, but I don't want to take that chance again. If you really need a military grade cover, you're going to have to pay a lot more for it.<br /><br />BTW, I bought it directly from the company's store, and it was delivered quickly.

425131,4,Awesome tuner to get interested in radio again,"Awesome portable wifi radio tuner. Claims it will support 99 presets but I’ve currently got 147 presets programmed in so I’m curious how many it will actually hold. Speaker sounds great and fills a room pretty decently. Tunecast website makes it easy to search for stations from around the world. You can send  and play a station link directly to the radio by sending it to the radio’s IP address. If you enjoy the station you can save it to the radio preset. As well you can use the radio interface to search and store presets but is easier to use the web interface. The skytune web interface also allows yo to organize the order of your presets and also add stations that are not found in the skytune database. Simply type in the stream url and save it to your presets. The trick is to figure out how to find the stream url address which is different than the station website. Search YouTube to learn how to find a stream url. When organizing the order of your stations start your order with preset #4. The reason is presets 1-3 are tied to the 3 favorite push buttons on top of the radio. If you keep presets 1-3 dynamic then you can change the presets programmable to the buttons without upsetting the order of your preset list. The radio will also receive Bluetooth ( but not send) signals so you can play your favorite Apple Music, Spotify service from your phone and hear it on the radio. I use a Bluetooth transmitter plugged in to the 3.5 mm headphone port to send to a large by speaker to play in my home. It truly is a portable radio because you can link it to your phone’s hotspot for use outside your home. Battery lasts ~5 hours on a charge. I recharge it by using a portable battery pack like you use for recharging your phone.  I am so impressed with this portable unit I am considering getting one of Ocean Digital’s table top units for home use. I’m extremely happy with this product and highly recommend buying it if you are considering one. It is very refreshing to get away from the corporate radio repetition of the same top 40 songs that have made modern radio so dull and boring.

In video settings you can adjust the resolution to save memory, set it to loop, oldest out newest in.  You can have the camera automatically set the light exposure settings or do it yourself.  You set the time and date the first time you turn it on and then you can have time and date stamps on your videos and pictures.  You can set a motion sensor so it can record a loop when someone gets near your car such as when you are parked somewhere.  It has a G sensor so sudden shocks of a user defined level will trigger it to take a loop of video.  It has night vision mode.  In photo mode you can set the resolution and turn Anti-shaking on.

I didn't realize that you can pause music and adjust the volume on the earbud itself which I've never experienced. It has the most updated Bluetooth which I can go far away with no hiccups or lag.

560878,4,This is a simple solution for either of two common problems. This switch goes both ways.,"If you’ve got a TV/monitor that is one HDMI port short, this will get you by. This switch will in effect turn that one port into two, letting you swap between what’s displayed through that port, at the press of a button. Albeit a button that is on the other side of the room, in my case. It’s working well for having adding both a desktop PC and game console to a TV with only one empty HDMI port left. There’s no remote, so if you’re not sitting nearby, and will be switching sources regularly, keep that in mind. Also no extra HDMI cables are included, so also know that you need 3 HDMI cables.<br /><br />One oddity in this setup is that switching to have the PC displayed on screen always takes several seconds for Windows to adjust its resolution (in this case, to the 4k of the TV). During this time, there’s a little black screen flash and/or the desktop resizing. It’s only a few seconds, but it is a minor annoyance. This is likely a computer/Windows issue, not an issue with the device.<br /><br />As a bi-directional switch, you could instead use this in the opposite manner, having just one video source output to two displays. I don’t know what the most common use case is for this, but you would again be simply pressing the physical button on the switch to change which TV/monitor was receiving the signal. IMPORTANT: note that you can not have one source display to both monitors at the same time. It’s not a splitter, but rather a switch. So one display would show the video and the other would be blank (or likely display a message about having no signal, or go into power save mode, etc).<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Works well, small, simple, seems to be of slightly above average build quality for the price. Not the most elegant solution, as you have the extra dongle and cable in your setup. And if you decided you later needed to add another device, you would have to replace this with a switch that had more than 2 ports. But if you want a quick, functional, cheap Made in China solution, this gets the job done happily. And it comes in purple.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LD1OmZyfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LD1OmZyfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LD1OmZyfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qv1jMxtoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qv1jMxtoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qv1jMxtoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71y70X08K2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71y70X08K2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71y70X08K2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BMG3KF5Z,B0C53JHW1M,AFL2UVN5YUVYJGYTS6FZKHICTUYQ,2023-03-31 16:55:55.366,0,False,494

It's typical for an ""entry-level"" telescope, and a decent value for the money if you want to get into stargazing without dropping 500 bucks or more on a bigger scope.<br /><br />First, as with all beginner telescopes, it is actually much harder to use than a more intermediate level one.<br />Because most kids like looking ""AT"" stuff more than looking ""FOR"" it. And with this telescope, far more time is spent hunting for objects than actually looking at them.<br />This is made for kids. As such, the stand is very short. Which means that all the time you spend hunting for things, you'll having to be hunched over, crouched down, or kneeling on the ground. And if you live in a place with a lot of light pollution, you won't be able to see much more than stars, the Moon, or the brightest planets. I could make out Mars and some faint detail on Jupiter. Venus, on the other hand, is very easy to see. so we've been looking at it every night. Galaxies, most nebulas, and many star clusters are beyond the ability of this telescope.<br />For perspective, we've had a few weeks of use and practice, and feel comfortable with the telescope, and have a number of apps, charts, and star maps to help me find things. It's cool and the kid loved it. I consider it worth the effort, but my back is killing me today from the kids sized stand it comes with.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, for an entry-level telescope, this is good. It'll serve our needs. But, like all entry-level telescopes, this is harder to use and not powerful enough to see the furthers planets and galaxies.<br />If you get an entry-level telescope, this is a good choice at an extremely affordable price. But if at all possible, save up (4x the price) and get a larger aperture.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BBI5FQxIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BBI5FQxIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BBI5FQxIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B095S4G6GC,B0BJ6CPJ32,AFOXEJK7WCDBIMSVU4ZFF27PAE6A,2023-01-13 16:23:19.643,10,True,494
612382,5,Very Impressive,"This is a really powerful little device. The size, however, has nothing to do with how capable it is to perform any tasks you ask it to do. I was REALLY, and I mean REALLY impressed by it.<br /><br />I purchased it primarily for playing VR games on it, and it has not disappointed. Furthermore, I also plan on running ProxMox on it to be able to run multiple virtual machines simultaneously. Preliminary tests have shown that it can also do this without issue.<br /><br />This MiniPC is also capable of running different flavors of Linux, though I haven't tested that yet. Super impressed with the network speed as well. I have it connected to 2.5Gbps switch and the connection is rock solid and stable. Wireless is also very good. Please be aware that it has a Wi-Fi 6E (Yes, not just WiFi6, but E, which is the latest and greatest).<br /><br />The HX90G is also extremely quiet, you can barely hear it, even when being pushed to the max. Any gaming PC would definitely make more noise than this little wonder. If your room is cold, trust me you'll need to get your ear very near it to hear it at all.<br /><br />The only thing negative I can say so far about the HX90G is about the Baseplate. It can certainly be somewhat cumbersome to install. At first, I genuinely thought it was defective. It almost looked to me like the holes on the plate (the little piece you attach to the unit itself) would not align properly. But after several tries, I was able to successfully attach it the way it was supposed to go. Please beware that you have to screw in one of the screws on each end first, then make your way one by one on each end. If you screw all the ones on side first and then go to the other side. It will be almost impossible to screw them in without damaging the screws and probably the unit's chassis.<br /><br />Other than that, I'm super happy with my purchase, this is my first ever MiniPC and if it continues to perform the way it is,  it'll probably won't the last either. MinisForum is a brand I had never heard of before. But they are making a great name for themselves for what I can see.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jdm+Fk0+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jdm+Fk0+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jdm+Fk0+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71N6pCEzoOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71N6pCEzoOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71N6pCEzoOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dDlKKY-wL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dDlKKY-wL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dDlKKY-wL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kFsUCTOZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kFsUCTOZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kFsUCTOZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wJ79Ic0EL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wJ79Ic0EL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wJ79Ic0EL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yJ-doKjoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yJ-doKjoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yJ-doKjoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yv-pm5VhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yv-pm5VhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yv-pm5VhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816JtIbKmmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816JtIbKmmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816JtIbKmmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81P6b7VqANL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81P6b7VqANL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81P6b7VqANL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81eRkhZhjrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81eRkhZhjrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81eRkhZhjrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81o5dR6J6tL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81o5dR6J6tL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81o5dR6J6tL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BM4BLDCB,B0C5MKQV6Y,AHITLTMJT6COTNVHQ4AYBJ252QJQ,2023-01-15 15:36:20.114,0,False,494
795228,5,Pretty good,"I spend frivolously on speakers, lol, and I own WAY too many… That being said, I decided to try something new as I usually do every few months. I clicked on these because of the lights, the price, and I thought the shape was cool. I saw some reviews mentioned that these are very light. I felt differently, as they had a nice weight to them. They aren’t overly heavy or large, but they fit perfectly next to my 27” monitor OR below it if I turn them sideways.<br />I like that the knob isn’t infinite, meaning that it has a start 0% and stop 100% for volume. It took me a minute to realize the lights are controlled by a touch button on the top of the right speaker. There are 4 modes, but my favorite is the one that goes to the music. It works surprisingly well and it sort of starts central and expands outwards like an old school equalizer. You can turn the lights off if they distract, just hold the button. RGB mode is the second coolest.<br />The side buttons don’t bother me as I saw for some. I like that they blend in because it makes it clean looking. The USB wires are thick and braided. The USB almost spanned two monitors, it’s a good size. The top button is power. I wish that it tapped to turn on, but you have to hold it. Not a big deal. The middle is “mode” between Bluetooth and aux. I’m using aux. The third is the bass or balance mode. This is the only thing on these speakers that makes me laugh. The voice saying “balanced” is bad, lol. Not a big deal though. You can use any eq you want.<br />I leave it on balanced mode and adjust it with a software eq. The natural sound is clean. It’s not overly muddy with typical pc bass or anything. I didn’t notice a huge difference in bass mode, but it’s cool to have. Each song and genre will sound different with any eq. These aren’t overbearingly loud at all, but the nice part is that they don’t distort no matter how high you turn them. They stay clean, even with eq and volume max. I’m pretty happy with the buy.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716CScz9xyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716CScz9xyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716CScz9xyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09XV5217L,B0C8NKK626,AED7GKHA5GJS5JV7AYOT7HBBO4XA,2023-03-13 20:48:02.574,1,True,494
125537,5,For the PRICE! It cannot be beat!,"There are many portable monitors on the market. Each one has a particular use case. Some are great for CAD / Graphics Arts, while some are more suited for movies. This bad boy is geared towards gaming with it's high 144hz refresh rate. After countless YouTube video review research I settled on this one as it was a GREAT price at $139+tax after a coupon. Shipping was fast and the item was packaged very well.<br /><br />Inside the box you will find all the accessories you need to get up and running. I am a cable snob and ordered a fancy mini-HDMI to HDMI cable I liked. The included one works perfectly fine. I hooked it up to my PS5 using the USB-A to USB-C for power and the mini-HDMI to HDMI cable for video and audio. Enabling the HDR mode on the device gives you a faux HDR look. It is not true HDR. While in this mode adjustment to brightness and contrast is disabled. You have to turn it completely off in the OSD to adjust.<br /><br />I just got the PS5 so I'm waiting one some games to test 120hz 1080P. I did confirm one YouTube video got it working. I booted up Astro's Playroom and it looked fantastic. While at only 60hz there was some noticable smearing as the response rate is not as crisp as my Viewsonic XG2431 in 60hz with custom PureXP+ preset. It was playable and bright enough. I did test the video playback with a 1080P Blu-Ray and colors look as good as it gets on an IPS panel. I do feel the raw contrast is not 1000:1 but more inbetween 800:1-900:1 That being said, if you enable Dynamic Contrast it does help with the black bars in movies. The 3.5mm headphone output is clear and has decent dynamic range but sounds compressed slightly. It gets loud enough.<br /><br />Full 144hz works great over HDMI on my Macbook Pro 14"" and a desktop Nvidia RTX 3080ti. I really love the 15.6 size, it fits under my 24"" main gaming monitor perfectly. Overall a great buy and economical alternative to the portable OLED monitors. If you need ultimate contrast levels for movies by all means go OLED.

684181,4,Does what is claims to do,"I've had the Y20GTA watch for about a week now and have explored all of the features.  What I can say is it does what it says it will do.  It's not flashy and you shouldn't expect flashy at this price point.  The watch is mostly a health and fitness tracker which isn't what I was looking for in a smart watch but it does seem to do those things well.  I purchased the watch mostly for notifications and business related alerts.  It is very good at handling SMS text messages and a few other common messaging apps.  The biggest disappointment for me is the fact that it doesn't have an interface for MS Office apps.  The only way to get meeting alerts, for instance, is to enable ""other"" messages which passes through EVERY message that your phone generates, even ones that you never see on the phone.  I asked technical support if there was a work around for this but learned there is not.  Since I mentioned tech support, let me explain that a bit.  Within the app that controls the watch there is a chat tab with direct contact to tech support.  The chat support has been very responsive and helpful even when providing answers other than what I had hoped to hear.  The watch has a few built in watch faces, only one of which I really like.  There are additional watch faces to choose from but most are very gimmicky and seem to be targeted at a younger audience (cartoonish).  You can only download one additional watch face at a time which is a bit of a pain since browsing through all the silly faces to find the one you like is tedious process.  Regarding battery life, out of the box it seems to be quite excellent!  I have charged it every night and by the end of the day I have not seen it below 85%.  Surely that will degrade over time but my last smartwatch barely gave me a day on one charge and, when it got old, did not even do that.<br /><br />All that being said, the watch is a good purchase for the price.  If you are looking for a full functioned smart watch to use for business you'll need to invest a bit more.  That said I am satisfied with my purchase and have enjoyed having and wearing it, however, I would not buy this watch again if it was lost or stolen.

744777,5,"Expensive, but capable","The TP-Link AXE16000 Quad-Band WiFi 6E Router (aka Archer AXE300) is one of the more expensive routers on the market, but is has the capability and features to justify the price. If you are looking for a router to blend in with your furniture....forget about it. If you want to make a statement that you are a power user, this is the router you want.<br /><br />My ISP plan is 800 mpbs, but I am running around 930 mpbs using a DOCSYS 3.1 cable modem. If I decide to upgrade even further, this router can handle it. If you Internet plan is 400 mbps or slower, you can easily use a WiFi 5 (AC) or WiFi 6 (AX) router which will be considerably less expensive.<br /><br />This is a WiFi 6e modem which includes a 6 MHz band in addition to the more common 2.4 gHz and 5 gHz bands. Furthermore, there are two 5 gHz bands. Please note that there are very few devices that currently support the 6 gHz band. My Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra phones do have that capability. Some Windowsx 11 computers support 6 gHz; currently Windows 10 does not support 6 gHz, even if you install the proper adapter; Microsoft has chosen to block 6 gHz on Windows 10. There are workarounds if you insist.<br /><br /> Using a chanel width of 160 mHz on one of the two 5 gtHz bands, I am getting upload and download speeds of 1815/2402 mbps. That gives me Speedtest rates of 400 mpbs over WiFI which is half my Internet band plan. That is excellent as you cannot ever get the same speed over WiFi that you can achieve over wired Ethernet.<br /><br />I am using a 2.5 gb Ethernet connection from my router to my primary computers.  The router compes with two 10 gbe ports and one 2.5 gbe port allowing you to get around the speed limitations of routers that only employ 1 gbe ports.<br /><br />Thus, if you are a power user and can afford this device, you will be pleased.<br /><br />Please be aware that WFi 7 routers will be introduced over the coming year.

It offers a host of nice audio features such as MP3 player, lossless audio playback, FM radio, blue tooth, equalizer, sound recording.  It also has an external micro USB slot to add plenty of storage.  It can even play video clips and function as an eBook reader; I have not tested those features since my only interest is for audio playback.<br /><br />It is small and lightweight.  Some might argue a plastic type of feel but I don't think it is too bad.  It has an old fashioned power slider switch at the bottom which I like.  The counter intuitive thing may be the navigation wheel inside a selected menu item.  In order not to have the typical separate ""return"" or ""back"" button outside the wheel, the manufacturer has opted to put the""return"" or ""back"" function at the bottom spot of the wheel this only applies when you are inside one of the apps.  So, on the main screen the wheel is a full navigation wheel (up/down, left/right).  Inside a selected app (function menu) the bottom spot on the wheel is your back button.  Up/down are accomplished via the left/right spots.  After a bit, you get used to it.  It is not a big deal, just pointing it out; it is the price for having fewer buttons, I suppose.<br /><br />Pros:  good sound quality which is what really matters most.  I used it with earphones and via Bluetooth and the sound quality was good.  Rechargeable battery.  Small and lightweight; fits in many places.<br /><br />Cons: none really.  It might have been nice to maybe have a protective carry case (sleeve), with a clip, for it included?<br /><br />For the price point of this unit, you won't be disappointed with the full feature set and the sound quality.  If you are looking for a high end ""feeling"" brushed aluminum case and nice metal tactile buttons, this is not it.  I have one of those as well and they cost a bit more :-).

319185,5,Like a wind tunnel in your hand,"Frankly I was blown away by this little (pun intended) tool.  It's a bit smaller than a hair dryer and it's battery powered so I was expecting something that had the power of a typical hand fan, but this thing really surprised me with the huge amount of air it puts out.<br /><br />I have a number of cans of compressed air that I use to clean my computer, keyboard and my garage workspace.  I typically by a six-pack.  I was hoping that this could replace those and offer me a little more control because those blast a lot of air and they are either 100% or 0%.  This blower has a knob that lets you choose how much air you want.  The lowest setting is still harder than I could blow with my mouth, but it's not too strong.  The highest setting is like a tornado!<br /><br />Since it's battery powered, I had figured that the highest output would still be well below the canned air level and I would still need an extra boost for some situations but I was wrong.  This thing throws out a huge amount of air.  It may not be as strong through a narrow opening as a can of air, but I can't see much difference and this thing is able to move a much larger volume of air so it can clear off a larger area faster.<br /><br />It's really more than I had hoped for and I will use it a lot more often than the can of air because I don't have to worry about running out.  I've yet to recharge it since charging it right after I unpacked it and I haven't noticed any reduction in the air flow.  It's reasonably heavy so I suspect it has a nice sized battery.  The instructions claim it will run for 20 minutes to 3 hours so I'm not worried that I will run out in the middle of a job.<br /><br />It comes with several different nozzles and brushes along with a nice quality braided charging cable (that I'll probably used for other things as well).

504437,3,Left ear occasionally drops,"I mostly listen to metal or podcasts so the sonic capabilities of high end earbuds are probably not fully realized for me. That said, I have been using various wireless earbuds for about a decade. The best earbuds I have to compare these against are the Sony WF-1000XM3 which are also noise canceling. Sony's WFs cost $149 against the hefty price tag of these at $395. Frankly, I can't explain why these cost so much. They ARE lighter than Sony's (even the case) and the noise cancellation seems better. Both are bulky in the ear, but that probably comes with the noise canceling technology built in. I also think these Bowers & Wilkins earbuds sound better but that can be a subjective thing since you can always play with the sound settings.<br /><br />Setup was a bit confusing as there are 2 different Bowers & Wilkins apps. The one that said ""headphones"" was not correct and needed the music app downloaded. Go figure. One of the main things I look for in Bluetooth capable items is the reliability in connectivity. The WFs are more reliable for me. I can pull them out of the case, put them back in, pull one earbud out, etc. and they regularly connect. On the other hand, the B&W earbuds sometimes take a long time to connect, or the left earphone won't connect or drops while listening. It seems the only way to reconnect it is to restart my phone. Sometimes it's hard to know if these issues stem from the phone or item connecting, but since I have few problems with the Sony earbuds, I'm going to blame the connection issues on the B&W earbuds. Besides, at this price point, I expected NO issues. Each earbud requires a little more effort to pull out of the case due to the low profile and smooth surface so it's easy to lose grip and have it pop back into the case.<br /><br />I will probably continue using these B&W earbuds as my go-to's unless the dropouts get really frustrating. They are lighter which makes them more comfortable and thus stay in the ear better, and the noise cancellation is better in my opinion. However, for what these headphones cost, I believe the casual user can get similar performance at even half the price.",[],B0BQTLL6KV,B0BTHQLV6Y,AG2BL45YSOYN7V6JETMUAYPIZLOQ,2023-03-13 18:19:09.771,0,False,494
612060,1,Motorola technical support unresponsive via phone or chat; totally unacceptable!!,"At Xfinity's suggestion, I tried to upgrade an old cable modem with a new ""recommended"" Motorola modem, MB7621. The process SHOULD be simple. You move the cable connection from the old modem to the new modem. You move the Ethernet cable from the old modem to the new modem. You turn the power on and call Xfinity. Very simple, but after days of calls, I still have no internet. Xfinity says to call Motorola, but Motorola can't be reached by phone or by their chat support feature. Ridiculous. Motorola advertises this modem as Xfinity compatible, but clearly there are problems, at least in some cases. Now Xfinity is forcing me to accept a technician visit, for which I will undoubtedly be charged. Customer service is a joke these days and has been turned into a new money-making opportunity for companies like Xfinity. Too expensive to retain experienced phone support people, I guess.  UPDATE: Xfinity tech came and was able to ""modify some internal modem settings"" and provision the modem. But ASUS router gave an ISP DHCP error, so no internet. Grrr. After hours of searching the Xfinity forum I was able to connect by manually changing the router MAC address. Way too complicated a fix (esp. if the Xfinity technician had no idea how to do it)! Motorola did respond to my chat question after two days. Too late. Sad.  UPDATE-2: Internet connection failed about 15 hours later. Was finally able to reach Motorola chat support. They said to reset the modem. That didn't work, but that was also their only solution. They said to call Xfinity. Xfinity couldn't do anything except send a technician again (at my expense). I ordered a new modem from the Xfinity list: Motorola MB7420. When it arrived, I switched the cables from the new modem to the old (less than one-week) modem, and instantly I had internet. I used the Xfinity app to activate the modem and it worked immediately. This is how it's supposed to happen. I give a big fail to Motorola for poor customer support and a big fail to Xfinity for not standing behind products they recommend. To go a week without internet was a major problem. Oh, and Xfinity offered me a $5 credit. What a joke.",[],B077BL65HS,B091ZHX225,AHUT4I5YYI4M3DVXGVG5HAITJTIA,2023-02-19 16:06:49.066,2,True,494
726791,5,"Love this generation of KZ IEM, but why memory foam ear tips?","I have tested many KZ IEMs including KZ ZS Pro X, KZ ZSN Pro X and this one KZ ZVX.  Overall, I am very happy with all of them although they are not perfect.  In fact, all of them are better than my airpod pros.  Many times better.  Unless you have to have wireless earbuds, there is no reason not to try one of these budget IEM to listen to music.<br /><br />One thing I don’t like about KZ IEMs is that their sound signature is a bit too bright for me.  While it is fun to listen to, it becomes shouty after a long listening session.<br /><br />KZ ZVX is a new generation of IEM offered by KZ.  While it maintains its fun signature, the highs are definitely toned down a bit although it still has a V shape sound signature with strong bass.  <br /><br />The mids are thick and comfortable. It gives you the sense of weight but not overwhelming.  <br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, the high is a bit more natural.  It is no longer shouty but the details is there.  I can now listen to my music for hours without feeling fatigue.  It is perfect for working out and gaming.  <br /><br />Soundstage and Image are surprisingly good for the price.  The Instrument separation is capable.  I have no problem pinpointing the position of different instruments.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the memory foam ear tips come with the IEM.  I never like memory fam ear tips.  I never find them fit my ears well.  Does not do anything to improve sound isolation while taking away all the bass.  If you try this IEM and think the bass is lacking.  I think it is more to do with the memory foam ear tips than the IEM itself.  Try silicone ear tips instead.  If you don’t have extra ear tips around, I highly recommend you to get SpinFit ear tips.  The improvement is nights and days.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great little IEM.  Sound super engaging.  Although I hate the memory foam ear tips, It is still a great IEM and 5 star to me.",[],B0BXX9TMZ8,B0BXX8TGTM,AE4YZ2FUNU3IHZPINVWFAKDUJ3YQ,2023-05-06 22:46:16.012,0,False,494
698620,5,PERFECT FOR MULTI DISPLAY MEDIA ROOM 1080P PROJECTOR and 4K TV,"PRODUCT VERSION REVIEWED<br /><br />ROFAVEZCO HDMI SPLITTER 1X2 4K 120HZ MODEL NUMBER EZ-SP12H28S<br /><br />QUICK REVIEW [TL;DR]<br /><br />PERFECT FOR MULTI DISPLAY MEDIA ROOM 1080P PROJECTOR and 4K TV<br /><br />REVIEW:<br /><br />Expensive, but good working device to split signals between multiple resolutions monitors, TVs or Projectors.  In my case, I have a 4K TV and a 1080P projector in my recreation room.  Sometimes I want to watch the TV, but for family movie night, I want to watch movies on the big 100 inch screen.<br /><br />Now, with the splitter, I can “play” each device at its own resolution without having to reconfigure my streamer each time.  Additionally, it makes it so the rest of family does not have to worry about which button to push or cables to move make the TV or Projector work.  They both just work.<br /><br />SETUP:<br /><br />The setup is very easy.  Just plug in your source, then decide what output you want for monitor #2 (1080p or 4K).  Monitor #1 is always the same as the input device.  For me the EDID button only works on COPY.<br /><br />PRO’s<br />- Compact Size<br />- Supports different resolution (downsync) on port#2<br />- Screw in Power Adapter to prevent power cord from pulling out.<br /><br />There is a port to allow for firmware upgrades, but there is no easy way to do the upgrade without installing lots of Chinese software, and vague instructions.  I gave up after about an hour trying to upgrade the firmware.  I don’t need it for now, but it looks like it might be need for VRR support in the future.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION:<br /><br />I recommend the splitter if you need the convenience of projecting the same image at 2 different resolutions, it seems to do a good job.<br /><br />I do recommend it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6130F1wO2ZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6130F1wO2ZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6130F1wO2ZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B7W94LHB,B0B7W94LHB,AGMVSBKQMUKZHZYYF6W2XNKZBCSA,2023-01-30 22:31:47.727,0,False,493
946646,2,Has issues with NVIDIA gpus Don't buy unless you're up for some issues,"I had gotten this some time ago, I still have it cause i haven't been able to find an afordable solution.  It does work sort of.  I have a Cintiq 21ux.  ThIs adapter doesn't seem to have a valid edid, so there for NVIDIA drivers recognize this device as Fail-safe which means it decides to only allow a resolution that the driver thinks is safe for the monitor which is often much lower resolution than the monitor can handle. You can not change this resolution normally, If you know enough information about your monitor you can force settings with the nvidia application however this can cause windows to malfunction in a strange way.  Sometimes I can not play games unless i use my cintiq as the monitor the game plays on, SOMETIMES games wont play AT ALL unless i go in to the nvidia application and turn off the display port monitor from there, so gaming with both monitors up is touchy and iffy.  It also causes my mouse pointer to vanish.  I have to go in to the mouse pointers options and make sure trails is on in order to know where my mouse pointer is.<br /><br />This appears to ONLY be a nvidia issue as windows default generic drivers before you install nvidia drivers seems to be just fine with the adapter.  Nvidia drivers causes issues with it though if you try to force it out of the fail safe low resolutions.  I do not reccomend this if you have a Nvidia gpu.<br /><br />The adapter appears to work better in Linux than it does in Windows.  Though it still has issues within linux.  It also has the same fail-safe default that windows has however you have to force the drivers via xconfig file to not use any kind of check system.  So no edid checks, no resolution checks no refresh checks.. nothing.  You have to then set both your monitors if you dual like i do manually because this will also cause your other screen to not be auto detected for resolutions and refresh rates.  Doing this also makes it to where both screens must have matching hz.  My Cintiq hz is 60 so my HDMI LG monitor must also use 60hz.  Linux mouse pointer doesn't vanish like windows does and doesn't have the game issues like windows does.  Needless to say i spend most my time in Linux now.",[],B01CE3DP0W,B0B9G76LHG,AEDB7CCS7JVSXM5ILGSQGJUPBT2Q,2023-03-24 19:59:30.956,0,True,493
594649,2,"I couldn't detect any ANC, and the sound quality was only OK.","I bought these to replace a pair of Tozo NC2 earbuds that I lost after using them daily for about 6 months. I also bought the QRO Classics at the same time, also for about $20. It took little time to realize that the QRO's were the better choice, so I have sent these (Wilbur NO5's) back for a refund. The differences were clear:<br /><br />1) Sound: the QRO's have a MUCH richer sound with a fuller base, excellent mid- and upper-range sounds, and it gets more volume. These Wilbur's were very average in sound quality, by comparison. I suspect that these have only 10mm drivers (speakers), while the QRO's have 12mm drivers. No comparison!<br />2) Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): These are advertised as having ANC, but I tried them repeatedly and couldn't find even slight noise cancellation with just the sound of a microwave oven. The QRO's have what I would consider average ANC, while the Tozo NC2's I used to have had incredible ANC - it was like walking into a sound-proofed room! I don't know if I just got a broken pair of earbuds, but I couldn't detect any ANC with the Wilbur's and didn't want to hassle with replacing them.<br />3) Battery life: average (6 hours) and on a par with the QRO's. Again, the Tozo's were much better, giving 11 hours of battery life before needing a recharge.<br />4) Controls: again, average. About the same ease of use as the QRO's, but the QRO's make a slight ""click"" sound every time they are touched making it much easier to determine if you touched them 1, 2, or 3 times. One the other hand, the Tozo's were so sensitive that anything coming close to them would turn the sound off or hang up on a call. This includes putting on glasses! That was a pain.<br />5) Price: at about $20, these are among the cheapest with (allegedly) ANC. On the other hand, the QRO's are also about $20 and give so much more bang for the bucks. Before you think that maybe the Tozo's sound tempting, remember that they are more like $40.",[],B0B4W342X1,B0B4W342X1,AGCQ7HFVHBNEIQH5CPRUIBZ3ZMAA,2023-02-14 04:49:06.428,0,True,493
58213,2,"Triggers on every car driving by at night.  ""Smart AI"" is anything but.","I bought this camera to replace an old blink camera that wasn't cutting it for me anymore.  I wanted something with better picture and better motion detection and this one was advertising built-in smart AI motion detection so I pulled the trigger.<br /><br />The good:  2k video looked good and was sufficient for my needs.  The spotlight was a nice feature and being able to use local storage for an expandable SD card was one of the main things that attracted me to this over other more popular brands.<br /><br />The bad:  The camera was completely unusable for my front porch.  I had it pointed at my front sidewalk, yard, and driveway.  The street was barely in view but I made sure to set the detection zones to just my area.  The first night I was getting constant motion notifications.  I watched them and realized that it was detecting the car lights flashing across my yard and cars as motion.  I tried pulling the motion sensor back to only half my yard and the first half of my cars in the driveway but it was no help, the headlights just kept triggering it.  I turned the sensitivity down all the way and it was still triggering all night and every time it triggered on motion it turned on the spotlights so the battery was draining rapidly.  I tried to set it to only detect persons but it doesn't have that option.  It's either 'all motion & persons' or just 'all motion.'  What's the point of having a 'smart-AI' if I can't tell it to limit the motion to just people?  Even then, it occasionally detected a car headlight and even bugs as 'people' because it's that 'smart.'<br /><br />I had to send it back as I couldn't be charging the batteries weekly and setting the motion zone to something so small that it wouldn't be triggered meant I was giving up on all motion except the patio stairs which is worthless to me.  Don't believe the 'smart AI' feature as it's anything but smart.  Also if you have this issue with the Tapo camera, don't buy a Kasa (same company) wired camera to replace it.  I did that because I am on the Kasa ecosystem and found out it's the exact same software with the same AI and the same headlight detection problem.

620836,4,Great Sound. Strong bass.,"Let me start out by saying this is an early review, I've only had this Soundbar for about a week. So any long term issues would be marked with an *update*.<br /><br />The sound is incredible. The settings have a lot of options for tweeking the sound to your liking. I found the installation very simple. I chose to walk mount and the screw guide was very useful. Also useful was the fact that the wall mount holes (plug holes) are spaced 16.5 inches apart so it was possible to hit two wall studs for mounting. I don't know if it was better to hit studs or if it would be better to use some sheet rock anchors due to the extreme bass. I am dueley mounted to studs and I have to have my bass turned all the way down because it's so deep it rattles the whole wall. Some people like the bass, and maybe it's not so bad when resting on a platform or entertainment center. I don't find this to be a reason to write a poor review, I turn the bass down all the way and everything is fine. The VRT:X button makes a really big difference in sound as does the TVOL. The Soundbar indicates when these features are on with 5 or so lights, off with zero lights. When I turn them off the sound is still fine but it is nowhere near as ""high def"" or ""3D"" we will call it. It just sounds so much better. If I turn off these features, I don't have the bass issues, but I'd rather have it on and turn the bass all the way down. I have it installed using the HDMI (arc) input on my TV with my NVIDIA Shield hooked to the TV. Some content will play in Dolby Atmos, that content is briefly displayed on the Soundbar with one single light for about 5 seconds to indicate it will be playing the sound for that content in Atmos.<br /><br />Overall I am very satisfied with the Soundbar. Didn't seem to have any issues. Some of the reviews I have seen are not for the Vizio sound bar that is for sale, be sure to follow reviews that are correct. I've seen some negative reviews for this product but are for a Soundbar that is not this product. I am very happy with it. 4 stars for the super deep bass issues.",[],B09ZKQPN37,B0BMWKN3HB,AE7YDRKB3MPETC7U6Z5ITSZS66UA,2023-02-26 02:49:42.581,7,True,493
543828,5,"Nice heavy keyboard, slim mouse - works with Android/iOs or PC/Mac 2.4G","Got this on a whim. Glad I did. Keyboard is heavy, stays where you put it, doesn't slide around. (that's a big deal for me). The keys themselves are transparent, and you can change the backlit color (several options for color and several for brightness level-including off). There are so many great features! FIRST: There are TWO BlueTooth connection/pairings possible. SUPER. I've got it set up for both my iMac and my laptop PC. A quick Function+key press changes the keyboard from OS to PC set up. I can use ONE keyboard for both machines as I need, switching back and forth. Aside from 2 bluetooth connections, it also has a receiver (2.4G connection). Because of my home internet situation, the mouse has to use the 2.4G and the keyboard uses BT. That's on me. KEYBOARD: nice full size, has a built in angle for typing ease and feels good when you type. The keys soft click when you press them (I like) the sound is not obnoxious. There are little lights on the top edge for pairing Bluetooth 1 and 2, 2.4G, battery. They do not stay lit, just function when you need them to. The keyboard and mouse were easy to pair (follow instructions if you need). Only thing I wish it had that I don't see: an indicator light showing if you've got the number lock engaged or not. When the caps lock is on the A/battery light will show green, so you can see that easy enough. Both mouse and keyboard charge with a usb type c port - and important! So you can charge and use them at the same time. It doesn't say anything about how to change out the keyboard's rechargeable 800 mAh lithium battery and there are no visible entry points into the keyboard. Mouse uses a ""size 14500"" rechargeable battery (there is a small screw under the receiver). Batteries could be an issue down the road. The mouse is super slim (not high profile). It has different colored LED light effects, haven't figured those out yet. The instructions with the keyboard are a bit sparse, but all the important things are on there. I set this up in less than 5 minutes...it's working great, feels great, keypad spacing feels good. Functionality is fantastic.

143878,4,A nice huge bag to take everything with you!,"Got this bag the other day and my first impression is that this is a pretty well made bag with lots of pocket and sections to keep things organized.  It has two big compartment with each able to carry a fairly big size laptop.  I had no issue fitting both my Inspiron 15 5000 which is a 15.5” and my Asus 14” Chromebook and most probably can also handle a 17” laptop as well but it will be tight.  With that said, here are some of my early observations.<br /><br />1) Lots of space & many pockets including two very large compartment to keep your laptops, chargers, or books and even some cloths with you on short trips.<br />2) Includes a USB charging port so you won’t have to dig into your bag trying to find that charger in this huge bag.  However there is no pocket on the inside to hold that battery so when opening the bag you have to be mind-full of the charging wire.<br />3) Comfortable to carry (to a point).  If you fill it to the max, especially since it has the room, your stuff will protrude from the back, making it awkward & uncomfortable to carry.<br />4) Looks durable & well made.  Even when stuffed full, I never got the feeling that it would come apart.<br />5) Water resistant – Before risking my laptops & cloths, I did a test run to make sure it was water-resistant and it was and so no worry there.<br />6) The bag is rigid as you can see from the photos.  Even when empty, it is standing up on its own.<br />7) There are no inside restraints to hold your laptop or sensitive electronics like camera in place so the laptop or camera can move around inside & move side to side especially if it’s small.<br />8) The side mesh pockets are mostly good only for water bottles & or storing some tissues or cloth but not for anything else and especially not for cables or chargers as they can get entangled in there.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this bag even though it’s a little too big for my taste. But if you need something roomy to take to the beach, camping or even to class, this is your bag and most importantly its a good value for what you're getting.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510z-NoHHpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510z-NoHHpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510z-NoHHpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SToLh092L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SToLh092L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SToLh092L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51djXZ2PZUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51djXZ2PZUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51djXZ2PZUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ndvoO3gQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ndvoO3gQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ndvoO3gQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51wA1RnlaEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51wA1RnlaEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51wA1RnlaEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xe7f2CUtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xe7f2CUtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xe7f2CUtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BS11X14D,B0BS132DYV,AE7JYVR4L3SUJPFYPSICK32KADQA,2023-03-06 19:44:07.231,1,False,493

I wanted to make sure it could sync to Google Photos rather than relying on yet another cloud repository, in the very likely possibility that the company no longer exists in 20 years.<br /><br />This review is based on syncing to Google Photos. I did not try Aura's support for uploading photos directly to their servers or syncing with other photo services.<br /><br />Pros<br />-----<br />* We picked the version with a white mat, which looks like a desktop picture frame<br />* Aura does have its own cloud repository, but you can simply point it at your Google Photos library or a single Google Photos Album and it will automatically update your Aura photos to keep them in sync<br />* The frame will automatically place pairs of portrait-orientation images side by side, or you can disable this so only a single image is shown at a time<br />* The frame will automatically turn off when the room lights are out, or you can instead set it to turn on and off based on time of day<br />* The frame automatically brightens/dims based on ambient light level<br />* Other options: set image timing from 15 sec to 24 hours, shuffle-play photos, enable or disable autoplaying videos, enable/disable notifications, etc<br />* Images have good contrast, brightness, and colors<br />* App-based setup is pretty easy<br /><br />Cons<br />------<br />* Viewing angles are not as good as I would have expected, so images look washed out if you're looking at the frame from - say - 45 degrees<br />* Not wall-mountable<br />* Google Photos does not upload videos to the frame (I think they appear as stills?)<br /><br />Using Google Face Recognition<br />------------------------------------<br />I created an album of our granddaughter using Google's automatic face recognition.

667149,5,Way Better than any Arc Mouse - Spectacular,"So, I know that it sounds odd to rave so much about a ""simple computer mouse"".  But that's not what this is.  It IS what I expected to receive, particularly at the outstanding price.  I have been a loyal fan of the ARC-shaped mice for well over a decade, choosing them over the very sleek Apple mouse options.  I love great design, and thus, I am an Apple devotee as well.  I will admit that with several design (imitations), Microsoft too, has come quite far in this area.  So, that said, it seems natural to want to spend lots of money on a ""great mouse"".  Well, if you are looking at this TECKNET mouse and are giving it serious consideration, end your search and buy this.  I swear that I have four black ARC mice near my computer, one of them the expensive Microsoft original.  And they ARE beautiful.  But the feel, the responsiveness, overall performance, and the look right out of the box have ALL made this the authentic PERFECT FIVE STARS that I gave it.  If I had to find a fault with it I would have to say that it's the fact that this one still uses the very small-sized standard USB connector for a Bluetooth signal to the mouse.  However, the most recent ARC mouse I have been using still worked and still felt good ergonomically.  BUT... when I say that it worked, I mean about half of the time.  It didn't use the little USB piece for a signal, which I initially loved and was impressed by.  It connects directly from mouse to computer by Bluetooth.  WHILE and WHEN working.  When you're working on anything that's giving you deadline anxiety or that you just want to work smoothly through, those without the USB connector piece WILL soon drive you entirely MAD CRAZY.  This not only feels good in the hand and works flawlessly and with instant responsiveness.  It doesn't EVER (yet) lose it's strong connection.  Out of fear that it could 'come and go' and wind up disappearing, I bought a second one - especially at such a great price.  In addition to this being SUCH an exceptional computer mouse, this is also a great seller to get it from, who will promptly follow-up with you to make sure you are pleased with your purchase.",[],B07YCFYLVX,B07YCGLHLL,AHKJTRLXDHVO3ZA25R426VD4I6IQ,2023-03-24 17:29:01.478,2,True,493

When I unpacked it, I wondered if it even had a battery inside it! In despite of the light weight, it does have a battery and a magnetic holder for the dongle.<br /><br />Now, I am not a fan of most magnetic holders, and the one that holds the dongle in place is ad bad as it gets. It is nice that there is a place for the dongle on the bottom of the mouse, but the magnet is too weak to properly hold it in place. A bit of shaking and the dongle falls right out! This is not good for a travel mouse, and I am sure that I will loose the dongle quickly on one of my trips. For the next iteration of the design, I would suggest a mechanical 'lock' to keep the dongle in place.<br /><br />The good part is that the dongle is only needed on devices that do not have Bluetooth, and since my laptop does have that, I will be using it primarily as a bluetooth mouse..<br /><br />Pairing was super easy, I did not even need to use the manual: Turn the mouse to bluetooth mode, and let Windows scan. It shows up as a Bluetooth Mouse and connects right away. The mouse-wheel had an LED behind it that stays on while the mouse is powered on, so it is easy to remember to turn the mouse off before putting it away. I am not a fan of blue LED's in electronics, but this one is not bright nor intrusive.<br /><br />The ergonomic shape is OK, if not a bit small for my large hands. It has the standard 3 buttons (left, middle, right) and the scroll wheel. All buttons function out of the box. The additional DPI button has a dramatic effect, and the effect is immediate. Works well!<br /><br />A big one for me is that this uses a USB-C charging port.

Probe on one works better than other.  One fan is faster at same temp drawing 1.7 watts other fan draws .9 watts with much slower speed.  If you heat the probes to 98f with hand they ramp up to 3watts and feel about as fast as the old fans but.........<br /><br />They are louder than old fans, they have  high pitched whine.  I looked at the blades and the old fans are rounded while need fan blades have sharp squared off corners.  Not a huge deal but not as quite and they vibrate more.<br /><br />- This is almost a showstopper for me - The website says the fans cant be run 24/7 they rated for 2000 hours?  That is only 83 days.  I ran the old ones 14 years.  They are just PC 120mm fans with a temp probe on them.  New one probably is not ball bearing.  You have to run them 24/7 there is not switch they don't auto turn off and they are for a sump or canopy.

951452,5,works for my usb-c monitor!,"The usb-c cable that came with my monitor is dying and I need a replacement fast. I've tried a few cables that I have lying at home but none of those worked. That is when I start to research and realize there are different standards and throughput involved in cables as well. So armed with this new knowledge, I start my hunt on a cable that fits my needs. Turns out, the search is way easier once I stumbled upon this cable.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- rated at 100W PD, you can charge your devices quickly. This cable can even support charging heavy demand devices like macbook pro (given you have a 85W+ charging adapter as well, as just the cable won't do)<br /><br />- 8K video - This is the main reason I get this cable for is the video capability. Connecting usb-c monitor w/ laptop is easy. As long as your laptop supports USB video (I think it's called DP Alt Mode? Honestly not too sure what that means), it will work. My macbook pro is quite old, and my laptop has ""Thunderbolt 3. According to online, thunderbolt 3 is capable of 40Gb/s throughput. However, this cable works well with it, outputting video to my usb-c monitor without issues.<br /><br />- thick braided cable - even though it's not as flexible, it's more sturdy for my setup, which is a portable setup that I wrap and unwrap the cables alot.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- USB 3.2 Gen 2 standard (NOT thunderbolt) - Note that this is not USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 (which is multi-lane operation thus double the total throughput) or thunderbolt 3 or 4, so it caps at 10Gb/s. It's definitely not the fastest but fast enough for most operations that I need it for. Also to note that older devices will probably be cap at 5Gb/s or lower if they don't support USB3.2 Gen 2 standard. That's not the fault of the cable but rather limitation of the device itself.<br />- price tag - there are some thunderbolt 4 cables out there around the same price (or slightly more). However, those cables are thinner and are not braided. So quality purpose, I would prefer this cable more.",[],B0BXK6GK7J,B0C3R7XTC1,AEIXBSZFVOO242R6L7P5NWXA74HQ,2023-04-24 19:25:00.379,0,False,493
856500,5,performs like a pro mic. these other reviews are misinformed. please read.,"[[VIDEOID:213770b423fe2955cc63ce95779fd877]] Originally I'd tested an $80 Rode Lavalier Go microphone on the Zoom H1n and it was terrible. The noise floor was way too high and the mic required too much gain to capture my voice whilst fastened to my chest. I promptly returned that microphone and bought this one...<br /><br />I took a chance on this since it delivered same day and it was so cheap and it just performed beautifully. I own six different lav mics from several top brands, and this one is easily comparable to them (better than some). I only added about 3 notches of gain and I could hear myself clearly with very little white noise. I could easily gate out the noise floor...<br /><br />We'll see how it fairs in the long term, as I've only just received it, but so far this lav mic has left a very good impression. Especially considering all of the extra kit included with the mic. (replacement filters, extension cable, and TRRS to TRS converter)<br /><br />""noise cancellation is on your phone, not the mic""<br />just fyi... these reviewers complaining about ""noise cancellation"" need to educate themselves on audio gear. I don't think they understand that acoustical noise cancellation is a software algorithm installed on their smart phones, the microphone is merely built to support it. You can turn it off on your smartphone. It is not a feature of the microphone.<br /><br />If I don't take care to keep my gain down, this microphone will pickup everything in the area with no problem, that's because my zoom recorder has no acoustical noise cancellation. You can hear this in my recording. (if amazon will ever allow me to post it.)<br /><br />""the mic survives minor bumps and drops just fine.""<br />furthermore, there is another review complaining their microphone died after dropping it 3 feet. I was concerned about that so I gave mine a few test drops 5ft and light smacks onto a marble floor. works fine. I think they're either downplaying the severity of their abuse or got a defective model and should've filed a warranty claim rather than whining on amazon.<br /><br />hope this helps!",[],B01AG56HYQ,B01AG56HYQ,AEQHSNN6GJWEDNRG6WB7AIG7U6RA,2023-01-10 22:57:51.930,17,True,493
173894,5,Early review. Solves audio connectivity problems with 2012-2018 Audi MMI.,"I have had the 9"" Carpuride display for 3 days and so far it seems to be working okay. I drive a 2016 Audi A3 e-Tron which has a notoriously horrible audio system and screen called MMI. MMI is especially bad when paired with an iPhone, so I decided to go Carpuride and just forget the whole built-in screen aside from the backup camera.<br /><br />The Carpuride is surprisingly well built and has a great looking screen. It is a little laggy but it is just as fast as any other Carplay screen I have used. It was really complicated getting it to work seamlessly with the Audi MMI, but that is the MMI's fault. If you own an Audi and are having trouble check out the AudiWorld forums. I have a tutorial over there.<br /><br />The built-in speaker sucks, the first thing I recommend is going into settings and muting it. The FM transmitter isn't much better but it is a nice touch. The aux output is satisfactory, but if you are using Carplay you can actually get your phone to send data to the screen and audio to your car's bluetooth. This is where this device really shines. The description doesn't list bluetooth output as an option because it is really your phone that is routing the audio. It is kind of complicated to get it to work but once you do this thing rocks. I assume you can do this with android too, but I am not sure.<br /><br />Using bluetooth audio direct to your car gives you a one cord system (just the power cable into 12V) and if you set it up right it looks like it is part of your car. So many cars from the 2010s don't have touchscreens so this really updates any car from that era providing a vibrant touchscreen and enhancing the functionality of your stereo. It would be even better for a car that doesn't have a screen. I just got rid of a 2011 CR-V and I REALLY wish I would have had this thing before I sold it, I may have kept it.<br /><br />I will report back after living with this thing for a few weeks but if somebody would have told me I could add Carplay to my dated Audi for less than $250, I would have paid it immediately. This does just that and so far so good...",[],B0B1CT284C,B0C136G56Q,AHR25YC7XMLPO2NU25ZX4CMZ7DKQ,2023-02-21 21:11:21.141,9,True,493
81739,5,"Works great so far, replaced YL1200500 AC adapter.","This  YL1200500 cable amplifier originally powered a 9-port Cable TV splitter amplifier that Time Warner Cable (now Spectrum) had installed at our house 9 years ago.  We later ""cut the cord"" and got rid of our cable TV subscription and I  mounted an outside over the air TV antenna and connected it to this same TV splitter, which distributed OTA TV throughout our house cable wiring.  Everything worked fine until late last year when two channels from the furthest broadcast TV tower channels started cutting in an out intermittently.  I initially blamed it on the Winegard preamplifier attached to the outdoor TV antenna and replaced it, but the problem continued.<br /><br />Eventually I figured out that it was really the power supply to the TV splitter amplifier, this YingJiao YL1200500.  It was running really hot, and taking it off and letting it cool could bring it back to life.  The thing is pretty heavy, indicating it has a pretty heavy duty iron core transformer inside.  I was going to get another one of these on eBay, but then I saw this model on Amazon.  Another review had indicated that this one was much lighter, which I didn't think was necessarily a good thing, until I saw the High Efficiency Level VI energy rating.  That actually turns out to mean something!  Less wasted power draw when the adapter is not being used!<br /><br />It turns out that these newer High Efficiency AC power adapters use the high frequency Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS).  Instead of sending the high voltage low frequency (60Hz) first into a heavy duty transformer to step down into a low voltage low frequency current, the SMPS uses a transistor switch to convert the house AC current into a high frequency high voltage current that can then be run through a much more efficient low mass transformer to do the step down into a low voltage high frequency current.  This is then converted into low voltage DC current.  This is why these newer AC power adapters are so light, because they no longer need these big heavy transformers.  These efficient SMPS power supplies were first used for computer power supplies, and now they are pretty standard circuitry for the multitude of small AC adapter bricks that we use for all our personal electronics.<br /><br />Anyway, so far so good.  The TV channels are all back again.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zErl0Ae2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zErl0Ae2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zErl0Ae2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B088K2MHJN,B088K2MHJN,AFDWEBB3AFU3X5QNJ73EUKJOGILQ,2023-01-09 03:29:48.328,0,True,493
200626,4,Not expandable nor does it have an App Store,"TLDR: An excellent smartwatch that does 60% of that other famous watch brand at 15% of the cost.<br /><br />FULL REVIEW:<br />This smartwatch looks very similar to that other famous brand and even has many similar features. However, it is limited to the apps and features that are pre-installed. That being said, it has a lot going for it as a daily activity tracker that can track many health and exercise features. On the iPhone, the data can be transferred to the Apple Health app.<br /><br />One area that is expandable are watch faces, you can have one custom installed watch face and three built-in watch faces that are not removable. There are lots of choices available through an accessory app called VeryFit (see photos). Unlike Apple’s customizable complications (data info), this smart watch can only display what is predesigned into the watch face. For example, you cannot show the weather or stock market data on a watch face. That data is available but you need to swipe left or right through different screens.<br /><br />I noticed that the watchbands are easily removable by pulling back a small pin on the back of the band (see photo) however, I’m not aware of any other watch bands that can be purchased for this watch.<br /><br />It does lack an always-on display so you need to lift and twist your wrist to turn on the screen. There’s about a half second delay before it turns on. Touching the display does not work either but you can press the crown to activate the display. The crown can rotate but doesn’t seem to be utilized in software, instead, you must swipe up on the screen to scroll long lists.<br /><br />When using the touch display, it is not as quick and responsive as I like. Sometimes I have trouble on the press and hold feature which doesn’t always seem to work. There is some haptic feedback but it’s not always used.<br /><br />Thanks for sticking with me on this long review but I wanted to make sure you got the info you were looking for.<br /><br />For the price, this smart watch offers a lot of features but don’t expect it to compete on the same level as that other very famous brand of smart watches.","[{'small_image_url':

316250,1,Worst Setup Experience I Have Ever Had - Horrible Performance - Horrible App - Total Junk,"This is, by far, the worst Arris experience I have ever had. The modem part (Arris's real expertise) is fine but the router part is junk. The app & customer support are beyond bizarre. I regret this purchase.<br /><br />1) The smart phone app is a disaster. It hangs up in the middle of installation, it somehow can't find connection to the service. Once installed, it continues to regularly drop connection to the network when everything else on your network remains connected. It makes configuring and setting up your router a nightmare.<br />2) Phone support for installation support is beyond bizarre. I was connected to what sounded like an artifical intelligence robot with a very thick Latin American accent. While the AI robot-sounding humanoid did finally get me basically connected, the end of the call was just him sending me back into that nightmare app to finish setup. That went well. (/s)<br />3) The router is a joke. It supposedly can satisfy a 4500 sft home but the signal cannot even acceptably travel 9 feet through traditional plaster walls. No setup or configuration instructions come with the equipment and what the company provides online is minimal and incomprehensible. The band sharing management features between 2.5 and 5 ghz don't work. And I have received the slowest wifi speeds I have EVER seen. While the signal is blazing fast in the room where the modem is (4 feet away), I was literally seeing 2.1 mbps upload and .5 download 9 feet away. Once you configure a feature (such as band sharing) in the app it is next to impossible to turn it back off due to the constant ""lost network connections."" Configuration, again, is a nightmare.<br /><br />This is just about the worst installation experience of any kind I've had in the past 20 years purchasing from a reputable company. Arris doesn't know squat about bringing routers or smart phone apps to consumers and it shows with this poor product. Whoever within the company brought this to market deserves to be stripped of all dignity and walk in shame a la Game of Thrones. At least that's how I felt yesterday.<br /><br />So now I have a (very expensive) modem and will have to buy a mesh router system to pair with it. Do not go into this purchase expecting the router to be adequate or easy in the least. Buy something else.",[],B096W716BY,B0BVH2SZRZ,AGKGLSMN2IDLL6YNL55VTDSWOFZQ,2023-02-06 02:37:29.833,3,True,493
213315,5,"This adapter is great, but it also makes me hate macOS","First thing about this thing is that it's pretty massive. You can reduce the size by removing the protective rubber sleeve. With the rubber sleeve it kind of almost feels like a USB-C dock in some sort of way. I couldn't test behavior w/ all 3 display outputs connected, nor when connecting to 2 4K monitors. However, single 4K monitor works fine, and 2 1440p monitor worked fine when connected to either HDMI+DP or over only the DP (the monitors were DP daisy chained in this case) in extended mode. Keep in mind though that this is only possible on Windows (and probably Linux), because macOS doesn't support DP MST, connecting either daisy-chained monitors (over DP) or connecting 2 monitors with this hub only works in mirrored mode, not extended. There's no way around this because Apple is stupid, if you needed this functionality you'll need either a DisplayLink or Thunderbolt dock instead. The 100W charging seems to work okay, although when I say okay it means that it reported 92W when I connected it to my Macbook Pro A2485. This is to be expected in my past experiences; I didn't get a chance test this on laptops w/ more temperamental USB-C power delivery, such as the XPS 17, so keep some of these things in mind.<br /><br />So overall, this hub works great if you're on Windows, and it's large enough to actually be used as a dock. The multitude of connectors gives you a lot of connectivity if say, you're constantly on the move and debugging hardware/connecting to a variety of monitors. The VGA helps too. If you're on macOS though, unless if you're say, going around and having to connect to a variety of monitors w/ different display inputs, this thing becomes less practical, because of macOS's lack of DP MST support, meaning you can only connect to 1 monitor in extended mode (connecting 2 or more will cause them to be mirrored). It's also quite pricy (at the time of this review, it's $70 w/ a 5% discount coupon) to the point where you might want to investigate used Thunderbolt 3 dock options if you're looking for a more stationary dock approach. Overall though, if you're on Windows, and you need to connect to a variety of different monitor outputs, then this thing is great.",[],B0BDSKM4XC,B0BDSKM4XC,AFKRDXRMPP46SQ2HUFSV4FDXYLDA,2023-01-16 20:37:51.845,0,False,493
491213,3,Definitely NOT waterproof! Challenging to learn all the features. Nice looking.,"Bottom Line: This watch (which is advertised as 'Waterproof') is NOT waterproof. My husband had been wearing it for a week or two, trying to learn it's features. Then one day he reached into the hot tub without thinking, since he has always worn waterproof watches, and this watch died. It was only under water for 1-2 seconds, but it never worked again. :(( So then he tried to take it apart to allow it to dry out, but taking it apart ruined it and it was already corroded inside anyway. Big disappointment, as this watch was nice-looking, the rubber watch band was very comfortable, and it apparently had a lot of features.<br /><br />But I will try to review what he learned in the short 1-2 weeks of wearing it.<br /><br />*First, as already stated, it's a nice-looking watch. My husband received multiple compliments from friends.<br />*The user gets 2 watch bands to choose from -- a black metal band and a black rubber/silicone band. He chose to use the black rubber watch band, as his arm is too hairy for metal bands which pinch. He liked the mechanism to attach the bands, with tool included, and thinks the band may even work with another watch face he owns.<br />*It has a very solid feel.<br />*The instructions provided are for using the associated app rather than for using the watch. And the instructions AND app were clearly written/designed by someone (or people) for whom English is not their first language.<br />*The charge cord connects to the watch via a somewhat weak magnetic contact on the back of the watch. It requires a specific orientation, so the watch and cord have to be set up and handled delicately to ensure the connection does not separate.<br />*A limited number of underwhelming watch faces are built in, but supposedly more options are available through the app.<br />*When the watch is connected to a phone via bluetooth, the watch annoyingly takes over as the primary speaker and microphone for all phone calls.<br />*Used the heartrate monitor only one time, and it seemed to be accurate.<br /><br />Again, my husband did not get to really explore the many features offered by this watch and the app, as he quickly discovered this watch has no tolerance for getting wet.

But just staying in my ears as is no matter how I orient them doesn't produce great audio.  I got used to it.<br />-You can put bigger tips on the earbuds, but only slightly.  Otherwise the watch face won't close properly.<br />-Earbuds last about 4 hours listening to music.<br />-Watch takes about 1-1.5 hours to charge.<br />-Does all the usual things smart watches do:  Displays text msgs, alarm clock, timer, stop watch, find your phone.<br />-The app is easy to navigate and syncs with any changes to the watch and vice versa.<br /><br />Note: Bluetooth connectivity between the watch or earbuds and phone or mobile device are separate.  You have to connect the watch and the earbuds as separate devices.  The earbuds don't pair through the watch.<br /><br />Overall I am pleased with this.  I wish the buds were better sounding and this would be a home run. 4.5-4.75 stars.  Comes with charging cable and a spare set of tips.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zX6ZMXvGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zX6ZMXvGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zX6ZMXvGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DdXw3foSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DdXw3foSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DdXw3foSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IWHmTXdAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IWHmTXdAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IWHmTXdAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KqtexWclL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KqtexWclL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KqtexWclL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KqtexWclL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KqtexWclL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KqtexWclL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OEn-WaM0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OEn-WaM0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OEn-WaM0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61R2jp82F9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61R2jp82F9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61R2jp82F9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61S0230W-uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61S0230W-uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61S0230W-uL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Tam1wjv2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Tam1wjv2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Tam1wjv2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oFP7dZ5jL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oFP7dZ5jL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oFP7dZ5jL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rGtfmyR1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rGtfmyR1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rGtfmyR1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rss2q170L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rss2q170L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rss2q170L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714IgJXjbsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714IgJXjbsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714IgJXjbsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DBAe1k+VL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DBAe1k+VL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DBAe1k+VL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71i0tUTUcGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71i0tUTUcGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71i0tUTUcGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BQYZJ9S5,B0BQYZJ9S5,AFKSYTK5AIS2KVXW7M5LUXLKJYVQ,2023-04-09 04:27:42.053,0,False,493
17586,5,"A great alternative to a popular version, but at half the cost...","THE GOOD:<br />---------------<br />* In terms of movement, and smoothness, it's just as good as the popular ""L"" brand version.<br />* Perfect for browsing your laptop or notebook while laying down.<br />* This is great for desktop as well if you don't have a lot of desk space.<br />* Compared to the popular L brand version, I do feel an improvement in ergonomics. There was a longer ""getting use to it"" time with the L brand version because my hands wouldn't completely rest on the mouse, and it created this tense feeling, when the objective is to make you feel less stressed and more relaxed. With this MicroPack version, due to a taller design, it took less time to get used to.<br />* The scroll wheel is perfectly placed.<br />* There is also one more button, it's the DPI sensitivity switch button.<br />* The track ball/marble size of the MicroPack is the same size as the L brand blue version, but they ARE NOT interchangeable.<br />* Battery compartment also has a magnetic compartment to house the 2.4 receiver.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* No bluetooth, then again, the L brand doesn't have bluetooth either and it cost twice as much.<br />* Now, I've gone through many L brand ones in my life. They all eventually go bad because the trackball collects debris, and no matter how often you clean the mouse, they eventually go bad. If you don't believe me, look at the picture I uploaded with the 5 blue marbles. That's 5 L brand versions that have gone bad, but I saved the marbles. So I'm anticipating the same sort of life span for this Micropack version, which is about 1 to 2 yrs.<br />* The L brand also beats the Micropack with it's unifying receiver system, as well as a dedicated software. This Micropack mouse simply uses your windows software for configuration.<br />* The L brand also has 2 more buttons next to the scroll wheel that you can customize.<br /><br />Ultimately, I still rate this Micropack vesion 5-Stars! Because though it lacks some features compared to the L brand, it is half the cost. 5-Stars... for now.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ui6FToE-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ui6FToE-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ui6FToE-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51YmmpOXmBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51YmmpOXmBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51YmmpOXmBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51lzQP5nfoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51lzQP5nfoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51lzQP5nfoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yEVbzMBrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yEVbzMBrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yEVbzMBrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zj-DPK0pL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zj-DPK0pL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zj-DPK0pL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BRX75KQ1,B0BYVZYH9B,AHR6RGZTLOMBD7EBF3OK43JWMGNQ,2023-02-04 22:15:24.496,1,False,493
418037,4,Decent quality for the price,"I haven't really used this yet, but my initial overview of it resulted in choosing to keep it. I ordered a few different tripods, looking for a decent compact travel tripod, and this is the winner.<br />I know that there are better travel tripods, but they are much higher priced (think Peak Design, 3 Legged Thing, etc.). This is not intended to be my primary tripod, so can get away with a bit more in the way of shortcomings.<br />The build quality is adequate and doesn't seem overly flimsy.<br />The flip locks on the legs are quick and convenient. They are made of plastic, so I'm hoping that they will hold up.<br />The ball head is very small, but seems to be sturdy enough to hold the camera. Biggest issue is the width of the Arca clamp as it seems narrow, meaning less area to grip. I think I've got that figure out so that it won't be a problem, but I'll need to be mindful of it.<br />Stability is questionable with the center column extended, so that will generally be a last resort. It seems stable enough for what it is when relying on the legs alone.<br />Detachable leg monopod is a nice extra, and it doesn't feel like it will come off on it's own. This was an issue I had with another tripod. I don't know how much I will use that feature, but it's great to have.<br />Carrying case is adequate, but is very cheap compared to some other. Just an observation, and not really a complaint at this price point. It will likely be used very little regardless.<br />The tripod also came with a smartphone adapter. This is probably the lowest quality item included. It's seems to be a very cheap plastic, and just barely large enough to hold my phone. I look forward to using it, as it's an item that I've had multiple used for in the past, but I will always be cautious of it breaking.<br />Do I recommend this tripod? Yes, as long as you know that it's not a top quality tripod. You really are getting what you are paying for, maybe a bit more. The other tripods that I opted against were more expensive than this one and just didn't quite meet the mark. Judge your usage appropriately to determine if it will work for you.",[],B0B7H2PVQP,B0BJPMRFKC,AENINCZYA3UCAMJZWM6CU5JL7KMA,2023-01-18 22:23:32.067,0,True,493
640019,4,"Great Camera, still many issues.","Update 2: Finally found someone helpful at Red Tiger. They recommended another dash cam software. However, that software didn’t offer Geotagging, so they offered a $50 refund so I could purchase my own 3rd party software. Update: I removed a star, because their customer service is not as awesome as some have stated when dealing with a return. Apparently I ordered the newer version with a in vehicle rear camera. All the instructions were for out of vehicle placement. Needless to say camera got wet and moisture got into it, and it became cloudy. Additionally, their software for PC is atrocious. It’s not even downloadable from their website. It points you to a very shady download site, that throws up virus warnings on your PC. I have a very powerful gaming laptop, their pc app crashes my computer within minutes of opening. Their answer is to run in compatibility mode. That doesn’t work either. Be willing to shell out another $35-$75 on dash cam viewing software, if you want geotagging. Wasn’t sure what to expect for the price, but it’s a great camera. Video is clear from front and rear, day & night. The App makes setup easier, than setting up on the camera unit. I added a 256GB micro SD, that’s the max the unit can use, and should be plenty. The instructions are not well written, you can tell they’ve been translated to English from Chinese. The manual is very small, and hard to read with the very small fonts. However, it’s available online. I opted to hardwire the unit over using the 12V accessory, for the added features, and cosmetics of the car. I purchased a hardwire kit on my own, but it does state in the manual, they will send you one for free (wish I’d have read that part first). Hardwiring to the vehicle was simple enough, only 3 wires BAT/ACC/Ground. Your mileage may vary from vehicle to vehicle however. I purchased the double fuse wiring kit, because it has fuse taps for all fuse sizes, and you can tap into another fuse if your fuse box is full. I can’t comment on customer support yet, I just purchased, so no need to contact them yet. This is probably one of the best cameras out there under $200","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mGM8H0QlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mGM8H0QlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mGM8H0QlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VvDJ8TemL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VvDJ8TemL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VvDJ8TemL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B098WVKF19,B098WVKF19,AGANABFCENQRUZUCNNRD4U53VLXA,2023-03-20 23:28:19.685,18,True,493
698820,5,My 11 yr old making moves with this,"I had orders this to review for my 11 year old son . When I pick things to review I try really hard to pick items that are worth the retail price because even tho it is sent to me at no cost , the retail cost is reported as income to the Tax man and I do have to pay income taxes on the item . If something sucks I will say so . I get the items even if I wrote a bad review if it sucks so when I say this was a great item to review for us I mean it . My 11 year old plays Kerbal space program on PlayStation network and he is all about space . He constantly tells me random space facts and brings up events regarding space . Sounds , sights , facts , we even tasted space flavored coke . It’s like raspberry rum . So he started asking for a telescope and m all for buying him one but I wanted to start small and go from there . This was offered for review and I requested it , it didn’t look like much when it came . It’s kinda little compared to a regular telescope. It’s portable in a pocket kinda sized . It’s been a good month or 2 since we got it . My kid takes it EVERYWhERE ! It wasn’t until about a week ago that I realized how awesome this this is , he had asked me to show him how to print photos of things he captured using this little tool. We printed it up and I was shocked to see Saturn . I can see the planet and the rings in the photo . My kid used an old iPhone 7 to take photos thru the eye piece of this little telescope . I gotta admit I was not expecting to see Saturn . I will find the photo he printed . My 11 year old is getting up at 6 AM voluntarily to look at the sky with this . It’s fueling the fire in my son for space . I couldn’t be happier . It came with lens cover caps for both ends . The only thing I dislike is the lenses come off with his carting it around but that’s probably more on him being 11 then anything . I’d give it 10 stars if I could . This for our needs so well . It’s a love for us . I’d recommend it , order it again and buy it for a loved one if they wanted to look at the stars and space .",[],B0BRXZ9PH6,B0BRXTCKY2,AEGFXLULLOWLUQ65YXDWU5YAA72Q,2023-02-28 21:59:27.083,0,False,493
184132,3,DRIVES ME NUTS!!,"Review is for Drivesmart 65 with Alexa unit but not including the use of Alexa.<br />The Good:<br />Driving instructions at intersections have always been good, and they still are.  And, Garmin support  when you call them is and always has been supurb.  Altogether I and wife have several  non-auto Garmin units, for cycling specific, triathlon wrist units, backcountry off-grid hiking.  I wish all companies had such support.<br /><br />The Mixed:<br />This Alexa unit recognizes speech very well, compared to previous auto models (I have 3 Garmin auto navigators).  But, have been unable to access many many carefully marked sites on other models with with specific site names I've assigned, IN SPITE OF GARMIN EXPRESS showing it still has the ability to move saved sites from one model to another.  Maybe the site names have been transferred, but I cannot find them under the names I've given.<br /><br />The company Garmin uses for updating maps is super slow in being current (It took almost 3 years to change exit numbers to the mileage based ones on the Massachusetts Turnpike!).  That company also uses local names taken from official maps of localities and counties -- unfortunately when everyone local refers to a road by its highway name, e.g. Route 146, Garmin maps will show the politically-nice name, like  Clifton Park Highway, or Halfmoon Blvd for US Route 9.  Google maps is up to date and uses Highway Route numbers.  Imagine going on a trip, following a map on what at one point is called Rt 67 and suddenly have it change every time you go through a small town, leading you to wonder if you missed a turn somewhere and are lost.<br /><br />Frequently I have to rely on WAZE to find something or something near where I want to go; then I can on my phone or car display tap on the specific location close to what in the past I carefully named on previous navigators and then get driving specifics.<br />  Unless I know the very VERY SPECIFIC COMMERCIAL NAME for a place I want to go, the place does not exist on this model!  Sometimes when I go to the separate app imbedded in the unit, the app will find what I want.

767484,5,Great for Recording thoughts or video,"I use this for times when I am brainstorming ideas for my business in terms of video content or marketing. Usually, my go-to method is to walk around and record myself as I come up with ideas, and then I transcribe them later using the software. It's a quick and easy way for me to get all my thoughts out as they flow, and then I go back and organize them.<br /><br />When I am walking around, I usually hold my phone up and talk into it, but I like talking with my hands and holding my phone; it sometimes causes the recording to go in and out regarding the volume of my voice, which can mess with the transcription software. So I bought this microphone because it was a great price. The cable is a great length for being able to clip it onto my shirt and have it plugged into my phone, and I still have a decent amount of slack in the cord. The clip keeps the microphone in its place, and the foam windshield does a great job of canceling out my pop sounds while at the same time not adding a lot of rustling noises from my shirt.<br /><br />The sound pickup is great for the microphone and it is very clear. My transcription software was able to transcribe my thoughts a little more clearly than just hand-holding the phone. the microphone is also directional, so it picks up my voice but drowns out a lot of the background noise, which is always a great benefit. I did not notice any static or hissing when I plugged it into my audio interface to do a test comparison, but I noticed a slight amount when I had it plugged into my phone, but that may have been my phone or the case preventing it from going in 100%.<br /><br />These will also work as lapel microphones to plug into a wireless transmitter that accepts 3.5mm microphones. I have a few Rode Go Wireless IIs, but these would be great for being more discreet or even as a backup, so I may be picking up a few more of these soon.<br /><br />Overall, I think this microphone serves its purpose very well; I think it is a great price for the quality of the microphone and its value. I may look crazy walking around and talking to myself, but it's worth it for the time it saves me sitting in front of a computer trying to organize my thoughts.",[],B0B95ZNMCQ,B0B95ZNMCQ,AEZ6OUYO3DAFRSJ36J2OBNIYMDUA,2023-01-17 20:14:11.361,0,False,493

Going for weeks without a reply other than their auto reply that asks you to provide information regardless of whether you already provided the information.

642876,5,We LOVE these headphones!,"We got these headphones to use with a TV that doesn’t have Bluetooth, and it works perfect! Not only that, but it was extremely easy to set up. After plugging in the digital optical cable (included) to the back of the TV and the back of the headphone controller, and plugging in the controller to a power source, there was nothing more to do except to turn on the headphones.  And in case you were curious, the speakers on your TV will continue to broadcast the sound, even though the headphones are also broadcasting it. You can turn off your TV’s speakers if you want, and the headphones will still play the sound.<br /><br />A few things about these headphones that I didn’t expect (but really like):<br />1. The quality of the sound is excellent!<br />2. The volume control allows you to turn it up to an almost uncomfortable level.<br />3. The earphones are extremely comfortable – even after hours of wearing them.<br />4. The volume and power controls on the side of the right side are simple and easy to use.<br /><br />Because I was so impressed with the things I mentioned I didn’t expect, I decided to plug it into my laptop to see if they were better than the Bluetooth headphones or earbuds that I usually use with it. Bottom line – YES! These headphones are MUCH better than any Bluetooth headphones or earbuds for all the same reasons I mentioned above. And it’s easier to connect to my laptop than my TV. Just plug the controller in using the USB cable and that’s it!

No threats to toss the darn thing in the trash. No tears!<br />Connecting to the internet...my first really scary moment. Suddenly a list of available networks pops up. I seIect mine, enter the password, hold my breath for a few seconds and voila...network connection established. Then I hit the sync button and before my eyes my old computer magically inhabited my new (far less expensive) companion. This couldn't be true! There were all my favorites, right where I left them. There was the obvious, of course. Documents and programs hadn't transferred, which was to be expected. Wait...Office 365 can't be installed? Run to Chrome support.

544781,5,Please read my review,So first off unfortunately I returned this projector but gave it a five star and I'll tell you why because for the price range in the dark it's literally just like watching a normal TV it's really bright really Crisp and I'm really happy with it just get to know the settings set the color how you like it set the size and really go into everything and know what it does because it's the first projector that I've seen where you can actually zoom in and out digitally it actually will make it fit your screen it's pretty cool the reason I returned it is because I like to hook up my Roku to projectors and unfortunately on this particular model you have to use both controllers you have to turn on the projector with the remote that it comes with and also you control the volume with that remote now the way it usually works is you should be able to turn on and off the projector with the Roku remote and do the volume with the Roku remote but since I cannot do either one of those that means you have to use two remotes and I definitely do not like doing that it's annoying especially if you're on the treadmill and you just want to get up and go. But if you don't mind using two remotes then I must say this is a really awesome projector but it's not for the daytime it should be completely dark your room cannot have any light in it it can have a little bit of light but it's only going to be for using at night time. I hope this review helped everybody out I'm sure if you're reading this you have a lot of questions and trust me if you don't mind to remotes this is a really nice one also it's got a USB port and I believe only one HDMI for the price point you can't beat it if there's only one more annoying thing about this unit is when you power it on and off I think you have to hit the power button twice it's kind of finicky and touchy just remember if you're going to buy a projector make sure that it's LED and not the old school regular bulbs with a filament. And I cannot stress this enough please read reviews you have to read the reviews if you just buy something without reading reviews it could be all bad and it's nice because you can go back and look at people's videos see what they say in the videos go back and look at pictures all right enough blabbering on here have a great night,[],B0B4V1Q2QJ,B0B4V1Q2QJ,AGXHEB6T3HKXZH6EA2DPNTNFYWSA,2023-02-11 04:53:42.451,6,True,493
684470,3,Nice idea but solar panels don’t work… or take an extremely long time if they do,"With so many people losing power during the recent winter weather, I thought it would be good to have some way to charge our phones in case of lost power, and I thought this device was especially great because it has solar panels.<br /><br />Well, the solar panels would be great if they actually charged the power bank, and maybe it does, in a few days or so. I had it sitting outside in the bright sun, panel lifted and pointing directly at the sun, for 5 and half hours today. The battery is still at the 2nd charge, which is what it was at when I took it out of the box.<br /><br />There are 2 sets of instructions but they're both in German, which I can't read, so perhaps I'm doing something incorrectly.<br /><br />There’s also a hand crank for charging. I did it a little while but if it’s as slow charging as the solar panels, I’ll be at it for days and might actually prefer to go without my phone for all that work. (I hope I never have to put that to the test.)<br /><br />Luckily you can also use 3 AA batteries so be sure to have some on hand if the power goes out.<br /><br />Now that that’s out of the way, how does the rest of it work? Well, I’m happy to note that it really does charge my phone. It’s slow but not too slow (1 hour, 4 minutes to get from 69% to 100).<br /><br />The radio works well and there’s even a pull-out antenna. This is not a 2-way radio but if you need to find out what’s happening or if the wind is going to keep blowing, at least you can listen to the weather forecast.<br /><br />I like the flashlight because it has 3 levels of brightness and the bright is very bright. There’s also an SOS alarm, though it’s not very loud. There’s a lanyard to hold the device on your wrist.<br /><br />I’m glad I got this in case of an emergency but I’m really bummed about those solar panels, thus only 3 stars.<br /><br />(Made in China)","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TM24D2ZoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TM24D2ZoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TM24D2ZoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hxtzVvUlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hxtzVvUlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hxtzVvUlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81DOEX6dlML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81DOEX6dlML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81DOEX6dlML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B936DXFT,B0BZCYYPKH,AGWUZW7UIA5GCO6CDXFPWQYTVOVA,2023-01-10 21:59:31.674,0,False,493

707264,5,Surprisingly useful outside a Surface Pro case,"So, tablets. Great for watching Netflix, terrible for writing. Yet people keep trying to write on tablets, so of course the machinery of enterprise cranks round and round and comes up with...keyboards for tablets.<br /><br />I usually don't use my tablet for writing unless I'm traveling somewhere. Now, yes, I do bring a laptop, but when you fly cheap, you're resigned to spending hours in a narrow chair with your knees in your nose, and in those circumstances a laptop can seem an extravagant waste of space inconceivable to any of us poor proles denied the comparative luxury of first class.<br /><br />Tablet keyboards tend, as a rule, to be pretty terrible. They usually have a squishy Chicklet keyboard or a cheap keyboard with the tactile feel of a six-day-dead weasel, so imagine my surprise when I found a tablet keyboard that was (comparatively; I mean, it is what it is) pleasant to type on, and had a light-up keyboard. That alone put it far enough ahead of my old tablet keyboard case to be worth getting.<br /><br />As a case, it's surprisingly attractive. As a keyboard, it is, unbelievably, useful enough that when I'm not traveling I use it as the keyboard for my server, which lives on a very cramped desk without enough room for a full-sized keyboard or a mouse. And it's useful enough it does admirably in that role.<br /><br />Yes, the keyboard is detachable. Yes, it's not just for tablets; you can use it with any desktop or smartphone with Bluetooth. The touchpad kinda feels like an old-school plastic touchpad from a low-end laptop circa 2002, but the fact it even HAS a touchpad is a blesing, so I'm not going to pick that particular nit.<br /><br />The fact that the keyboard lights up is a HUGE plus when traveling, since I don't have to risk the ire of my seat-mate by turning on that weird little overhead light that never quite lights up what you want it to anyway.<br /><br />I honestly didn't expect to end up using it the way I'm using it, but then again, I didn't expect the keyboard to be as useful as it is, either. It's nice to be pleasantly surprised sometimes.",[],B0BM9LLGPX,B0BYJ6THY9,AG4OYCEXNCKZNM3CTW3JZIV5LSEA,2023-02-23 00:53:59.033,0,False,493
459888,4,Nice Camcorder with all the accessories but,"I could only give it a 4-star rating and here's why. I am not a professional photographer or videographer but giving my honest opinion as a consumer.<br />First of all, this is a great video camcorder with just about every accessory you could want. It does a great job and does not feel cheap. The frame rate is good and it captures nice looking video and images. the 2 images you see in my review are taken directly from the Sd card that is provided. this comes with a 32GB SD card.<br />I feel the quality of the pics are good however the 1 picture at dusk does suffer from some graininess and pixelation. I actually did not expect it to be this good, so I am quite pleased.<br /><br />When playing back the video on the camcorder itself I feel the video quality lacks some and the sound coming from the camcorder is not real clear.<br />Now with that said once this is uploaded to the Tv or computer the sound comes out great and the video quality is so much better.<br />Also only giving it a 4-star rating because of the battery life. It does come with 2 batteries and they do charge up rather quickly but I feel like the camcorder drains them pretty fast, especially if you are into doing time lapses and using a lot of the different features this camera has.<br /><br />This WIKICO 4K Video Camera Camcorder deserves the 4 star rating that I am giving it because it is great for the first time vlogger, hobbyist, or just catching family moments. Also it comes with everything for you to get started right down to the 32Gb SD card, the external mike, the remote control and the lens hood, which really is a nice feature.<br />Speaking of the remote control I would highly recommend using this for all the functions, it really makes it easy and has a great range. Overall the zoom on the camera is good but does start to get grainy towards the 18X most likely because it is a digital zoom and not a completely smooth transition.<br />So overall this is a really nice camcorder, a complete package and a strong 4-star rating, it really is going to come down to the cost and what you want to use it for. For me it works just fine and does everything I need it to.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yNixl71XL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yNixl71XL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yNixl71XL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716uvh1pPxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716uvh1pPxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716uvh1pPxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71OBH3Lay+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71OBH3Lay+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71OBH3Lay+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RqbjAMkUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RqbjAMkUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RqbjAMkUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gUh4u5h7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gUh4u5h7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gUh4u5h7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BRLBDNWS,B0BRLBDNWS,AHJEEPCD6ETSFBLP6NJ3EMWDHVBA,2023-02-22 15:40:38.843,1,False,493
485431,5,Great sounding budget BlueTooth headphones,"I've had these for about a week.  The sound quality is quite good, which is to be expected from Sennheiser.  I prefer over-the-ear headphones because earbuds fall out of my ears and just don't feel comfortable.  These are quite light and comfortable to wear for hours at a time.  The cups are small enough to fit under the warm comfy hat I wear in cold weather when walking outdoors.  The battery life seems pretty spectacular.  I've charged them once and used them for a total of perhaps 4 hours and the battery is still at 80%  They quickly and easily paired with my Windows PC, Android phone, and Android tablet.  I have used them for phone calls and Teams calls and people can't tell I'm using a BT headset.  No one has complained about the microphone quality.  The BlueTooth is smart enough to handle listening to music from one device and mute the audio when a call comes in from a second device, at least until you answer it.<br /><br />Now for the things I find annoying:<br /><br />-The Sennheiser app you must use to adjust the built-in equalizer.  The app itself is okay, but I don't like having to register just to use it.  Use a fake name and disposable email address.<br />-I wish these folded for travel or came with a hard case.  Not really a complaint for the price paid.<br />-Noise cancelling would be nice. (again, not really a complaint for the price)<br />-An option to connect with a cord would be nice.  (again not a complaint - I knew what I was buying)<br />-My only real, relevant complaint:  If you're connected to multiple devices and you go out of range of one, the headphones will remind you incessantly every 30 seconds or so that you've ""lost connection"", even if the device is miles in your rear view mirror at that point.  I wish there was a way to turn this reminder off, though turning the headphones off and back on again and letting them pair again with the remaining device(s) makes the nag go away.<br />-Oh, and the fake British voice that this and so many BT audio devices seem to use to report information is not terrible, but mildly annoying.",[],B08N1RHYTB,B08N1RHYTB,AGFKJ74TFHMOXTKANZGBZ7UWNG3Q,2023-01-11 16:42:40.468,5,True,493
37798,4,Kind of disappointed,"First: If you buy the LTE version-your provider will charge an activation fee and a monthly fee. I bring this up as I was unaware and kind of shocked. Big rip off from the provider, should work with your current phone number and not be charged extra. Mine came with a grey colored band, rubber, that will probably not be good in the summer in the deep south. It is M/L-adjustable, guessing up to approx. 8-8.3 wrist. but not sure if ok for someone with a small wrist. I had the gear 3 classic previously, I'd still have it if my house was not robbed. This one was advertised as smaller in size. It is not. More of a bump on the back and still is very bulky and big. even at 45mm, it seems just like my old watch at 46mm. The front ring that moved on the top is now only available on the 4 model. Instead of the ring moving-you just slide your finger around the top and that does the same as the moveable ring. This does not have as many faces as my old watch and you cannot use most of the old ones on this new watch, which I am not really happy about. Seems they have eliminated the free ones to make you pay. I REALLY do like the function that you can change the orientation which was not available on the 3, but is now available on the 4 and 5. I don't wear my watch like the traditional way, so this is great for me. Not sure about the battery life yet. Been playing with it for 2 days now getting everything set up. Seems like this is geared more to the excercise world than the just plain watch world that just wants cool functions. I picked this one as they show the battery life is better than the 4. LAST BUT NOT LEAST: It comes with a charger, but not complete. The round magnetic peice that sits on the back of your watch on one end of the cable and a USB C plug on the other. So unless you have a laptop that has a USB C plug on it, you have to buy an adapter that the USB C plugs into and then into a wall outlet or USB C F to USB A adapter converter.  Which should come with it, but does not.  I had to buy one as my laptop does not have usb c.

It comes with the main remote controller rounded square thing hub (I don’t really know what to call it, it’s a remote but looks like a hub) and a USB power cable.  Set their app up on your phone and it then walks you through the whole set up process to get all your devices linked, it’s fairly easy.  If it doesn’t have your device, it will learn from your old remote or you can input its specific frequency, pretty cool.  It has a nice user face and easy to understand system.  You can set up scenes and have them function at warranted times and on specified day(s).  It has a lot of flexibility.  You can also now use Sari with HomeKit, works well.  I use my controller to turn on/off my TV scenes, light scenes and automatic roller blinds.  Everything works well most of the times, Sometimes I have to repeat a scene a few times to get everything working correctly, and often for my automatic roller blinds.  I had them closing at 9pm but 50% of the blinds will be closed, I would have to send the “close blind” scene a few times to get them all closed.  I know have the blinds closing at 9pm, 9:01pm, 9:02pm and 9:03pm. That way the signal would be sent 4 times and it closes all the roller blinds 90% of the time now.  I’m to bothered to set more times up at this moment, like 9:05pm, 9:06pm, etc. (plus I shouldn’t have to), so I just deal with the 90% success rate for now.  A few other devices I have the same problem with but less frequently.  So, it’s nice product over all, but getting your linked devices to all properly line up and function correctly when needed, is a hit or miss.

663539,2,"Low cost switch, but don't believe the feature set in the listing.","While this may be a reasonable, low-cost GbE switch, I find the specs and documentation a bit lacking.  Here's a list of my issues with it:<br />1) The box indicates ""Smart Switch"", and the front label indicates ""Intelligent Switch"", but yet it is an unmanaged switch.  I am not sure when ""unmanaged"" became ""smart"", but this seems misleading to me. If you are looking for a managed switch, look elsewhere.<br />2) Both the description and the docs indicate ""PoE"", and the manual specifically states ""it also provides direct current power to the equipment"" -- yet the unit cannot receive power over the Ethernet line (I checked it with my own PoE switch) and the power adapter included is surely not capable of providing PoE to any downstream devices.  Another possibly-deceptive, or at least unclear, indication.  If you need PoE, look elsewhere.<br />3) High latency.  While I did not measure it, this switch purports to have latency under 150us. This is relatively high for a GbE switch, which is typically in the 50-125us range.  Again, the average person may not care, but if low latency is important to you, then look elsewhere.<br />4) The power input transformer provides 5V 1A (5W) through a standard 2.1x5.5mm barrel plug.  I suppose it MIGHT be possible to use a PoE to USB power adapter and use PoE to power this unit, but the use of a barrel connector instead of a standard USB port would make this more tricky.<br />5) The online listing shows ""5-16V input power"", but the documentation makes NO mention of this. If this piece of data is accurate, then I would expect that a 12V transformer with standard barrel connector, or a PoE->12V adapter could work to power this switch.  However, given all of the other misleading text, I cannot say whether such a configuration would work or not, and I wasn't about to test it on my own unit.<br /><br />All is not lost, though -- if you are in a small home or apartment and just need to add a few more devices at a very low price point, then this may be what you want.

730037,3,Warning: ROKU Does NOT PROVIDE Key Remote Recharging Cable & There are NO BROWSER Options,"The product has some great features.<br /><br />#1 But after using the item for only 3 months the lightly used remote stopped working--only to discover it ran out of battery power. I actually planned to watch a very important TV show that was ONLY being shown around the time when my remote died. I then tried to open up the remote to change the batteries which was impossible since this battery-less model remote must be recharged for 3 hours after it dies before reuse. On top of that after contacting Roku technical support I discovered even though they even provide everything else you need including private listening ear buds, they DO NOT INCLUDE the remote recharger cable. The tech support person said, it's ok sir you can use ""ANY"" cell phone charge cable. FALSE, the device only uses an ANDROID connection so if you are in the sizeable iPhone user population then you are screwed. When I mentioned this to their tech support agent, he says ""sir you can buy a Android charger cable at any store."" But that particular day was the LA Marathon race with gridlocked sidestreets so by the time I got a cable that important one time show telecast I wanted to see was overwith. ROKU could have probably had a short recharger cable manufactured in China for pennies, but due to their company's CHEAPNESS they instead inconvenience many iPhone user customers like me who may be so frustrated and aggravated they might not buy a future  ROKU product because of this. I will instead buy and Amazon or Apple product next time. So that extra 5-10 cents saving by NOT INCLUDING the required charger cord has cost them my lack of brand loyalty. When will corporations ever learn common business sense--especially in 2023? Ridiculous!<br /><br />#2 Amazon Firestick products allow for the option of using a Firefox WEB BROWSER and services such as Facebook Live which despite all the ballyhoo of Roku Ultra being supposedly better and offering more features than any similar product. Sometimes from my living room flatscreen TV (not my laptop or cell phone) I want to check a website or watch service from my church on Facebook Live and I can't. There is a Bluetooth option for AUDIO streaming, but apparently NOT VIDEO. To me this is a HUGE OVERSIGHT and INCONVENIENCE on behalf of Roku.",[],B09T4VZDYV,B0BK6QHTCP,AGPUTPT5GP6ELL4LVSE2F77CH6IA,2023-03-20 17:03:24.376,0,False,492
167044,5,"My Experience with Samsung 970 EVO Plus SSD: Pros, Cons, and Lessons Learned","I recently upgraded my Lenovo P15 with a Samsung 970 EVO Plus NVMe SSD and I must say, the experience has been life-changing. Before I made this purchase, my life was in shambles and I was on the verge of losing my job. But all that changed when I discovered this SSD.<br /><br />It all started when I was playing a casual round of Rainbow Six and my teammates started making fun of my slow load times. Out of curiosity, I started researching about SSDs and eventually found the Samsung 970 EVO Plus. I took a leap of faith and invested $200 in it, and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.<br /><br />As soon as the SSD was installed, I felt a change in my life. I was invigorated and felt like I was at a complete balance. I took charge of my life, joined a gym, and started eating better. I even made significant progress in my physique and social life. My dog was no longer sick, and I felt like a new person.<br /><br />The installation process was incredibly easy, and I was able to clone my HDD onto the SSD with ease. When I booted my PC through the SSD, everything went dark, and I felt like I was transported to a different world. It was a surreal experience, and I was left wondering why I didn't get an SSD sooner.<br /><br />A week after installing the SSD, I quit my job and invested in cryptocurrency, which made me millions overnight. I no longer have to deal with slow load times, and my life has completely changed for the better.<br /><br />However, I did face a few challenges during the installation process. The Lenovo site didn't provide complete instructions on how to install the SSD, and I had to do a lot of searching on the web to figure out how to get it to work. I had to disable the battery, go into BIOS, and change the boot sequence. It was a bit of a hassle, but it was worth it in the end.<br /><br />In conclusion, the Samsung 970 EVO Plus NVMe SSD has been a game-changer for me, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade their PC. Just be prepared to face a few challenges during the installation process, but it's well worth it in the end.",[],B07MFZXR1B,B08D7638C8,AECNKJZHN7HBJV2M4Q7SRRI7F5QQ,2023-02-17 01:35:51.934,0,True,492
276877,4,Quality budget dock that I recommend. Mostly does what I want it to do.,"This is the second dock I've tried for the Steam Deck. The first one was a bit of a disaster (although the aluminum case part was really nice on the competitor). So I'm mostly going to ignore the things that work great. I recommend this dock. Whether it's desktop mode or gaming mode, it almost always does what I want it to.<br /><br />So what did I have issues with? Getting it to run at higher than 60hz. I tried numerous HDMI cables. Some new and some old. All of which work flawlessly on my PC running 4k @ 120hz. I don't know why 1080p/1440p @ 120hz were giving me issues, since it's within the bandwidth specs of this dock.<br /><br />I could get it to recognize 1080p @ 120hz in the gaming mode. And I could even select 120hz in game settings. But it just would never run at 120fps. Gamescope would always lock to 60fps. This is with V-sync turned off. Allow tearing turned on. 120fps/off caps selected.<br /><br /> In desktop mode I could get it to engage 120hz and you'd have the telltale mouse icons being super smooth. But for whatever reason, I could not get anything to actually run at 120fps in gaming mode. And 1440p was just off the table. Maybe it's because the shortest cable I used was 10 feet. IDK. As I said, these cables all work flawlessly on my PC at 4k @120hz. So they're getting the full 48Gps there.<br /><br />Now is this important? I don't think so. How important is this really? The Deck doesn't have power to spare. I would recommend running at a higher resolution over hz in the Deck's case. And BTW, running older emulators @ 4k @ 60hz with the CRT Royale shader looks amazing on a 4K OLED TV.<br /><br />I generally prefer the CRT-lottes-multipass-glow shader when playing in handheld mode, but CRT Royale is built for 4K displays. It's also a pretty expensive shader. Yet the Deck could run older emulated 2D games at 4K with the CRT Royale shader and they look amazing on an OLED. So thumbs up on that.",[],B0BTJYY8MD,B0BTJYY8MD,AFPSGQX4ZIDW6BD7QTCO776742RA,2023-04-22 21:00:04.861,0,False,492
323427,4,Worked better than I expected,"Having tried two other cameras this one worked as expected. Without having the best camera out there, which is anyone's guess with the endless variety's to make a comparison to, this one works very well. I researched dozens of cameras, read reviews and watched Utube reviews, as we all do and settled on this product<br /><br />Pros: Easy to set up with the included instructions. Included cables to initially charge the internal batteries and all the hardware needed to mount. Solidly built. The IR has a roughly 25 foot coverage and the motion detection, after it trains itself is pretty good at around 35 to 40 feet. Internet connection remotely is very good with only a short delay to start downloading live feed or recorded segments. Notifications take about 30 seconds to a minute after detecting motion to hit my phone. Overall the remote function is very good. I initially bought 2 cameras to evaluate the quality. I was satisfied enough to buy two more. The solar panels kept these cameras charged sufficiently even after 4 days of cloudy weather and none of them went below two bars on the charging indicator.<br />Install micro SD cards in all the cameras and the hub if purchased. this will save you money not having to sign up with cloud storage service. 64 Gig video specific cards have plenty of storage and they are cheap.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Although the set up instructions get you through the start up well, they lack almost anything about how to navigate the features of the cameras and the hub if it comes with that. This is typical of any Chinese made product. A lot of trial and error eventually cements your learning curve.<br />There is no explanation what the SD card does that is inserted into the hub. That would be nice to know!<br />Although these cameras seem solidly built the adjustment screws and access cover screws can be easily stripped on the head. A Phillips head screw driver is included and works OK but someone in china over torqued the screws in a few locations and it took a regular size screw driver to get several screws loose  stripping the heads in the process. I had to replace them with similar more robust screws. Caution here is recommended.<br />The only other complaint would be rain water running across the lenses. Makes the camera useless. Mounting under an over hang of some sort seems better. A better cover over the top of the lenses would be an improvement.",[],B0B2PN9CMH,B0B2PN9CMH,AGCEJV2XAWWN2KC5IFV6ZIFRCLVQ,2023-01-30 14:52:29.609,1,True,492
659180,5,Solid T4 dock if you don't already use a T3 dock,"1. I am a big fan of Accell and there is nothing wrong with their product at all.<br />2. I recently picked up an Accell TB3 and TB4 to compare and I would have definitely kept the T4 if I had a good use case. For me, I run an MBP 14 M1 with a large single curved monitor, so the dual monitor thing is not a huge deal. I am what you would call a power business user. For me, the T3 works fine and I could not tell any difference in performance. My monitor is at best 4k, so pushing to 8k (something the T4 does for single) was not a deal maker or breaker. All this said, if you are a power gamer with a 6+ to 8k monitor, you'd want the T4. The T4 has an advanced SD card reader, the T3 does not. The MBP has an SD card reader + I have an external one, no real upside to that. Also, the MBP 14 has 2 other Thunderbolt ports, so that helps, if really needed. The T4 has 1 extra Thunderbolt port if needed (I don't). The T4 has slightly better video performance on paper. (DisplayPort 1.2 on the T3, can support up to 4K resolution at 60Hz, while DisplayPort 1.4 can support up to 8K resolution at 60Hz and 4K resolution at 120Hz.) While that is the case, I could not see any difference in my application use. It might matter in a super-high res monitor, or photo editing, yet for standard 4K, no real dif.<br /><br />Again no issue with the TB4 product, it is solid and the price is right considering other offerings for TB4. That said, at over $100 less for TB3 it is a much better value. I am simply not getting much extra bang for the buck on TB4. However, for a more standard MBA or 13-inch MBP users would be better suited by the TB4 for obvious reasons.<br /><br />TB3 - Accell Thunderbolt 3 Dock - Dual 4K at 60Hz, 70W Charging<br />TB4 - Accell Thunderbolt 4 Dock - Dual 4K or Single 8K, Max 96W, UHS-II Card Reader 2 x TB4 Ports",[],B09KZBD1KJ,B09KZBD1KJ,AHVQN4N5UGXL36FXUESPUM3RJX3A,2023-04-07 00:51:13.856,0,True,492
664738,4,Not really undetectable,"I’ve seen DIY projects to build mouse jigglers yourself, but they are cumbersome and really only practical for hobbyists. When I saw that they miniaturized this into a USB dongle, I knew I had to try it. So what are these useful for? Most work computers have a preset time limit as far as how long a user can be away from the computer before it goes to sleep and locks. And if the company uses MS Teams or any similar app, the user’s status will be set to “Away”.  My work computer is set to a very short 5 minutes and cannot be changed. It is frustrating to go get a cup of coffee or take a bathroom break to come back to a locked computer that I have to log back into again. A mouse jiggler solves this by moving the mouse for me, so the computer doesn’t go to sleep. This particular device has a power button and a movement mode button. The first 2 modes are not practical since the movement range is too great, but the last one moves the mouse cursor very slightly and is sufficient for keeping the computer awake. There is a series of LEDs that light up in a circular fashion, which rather annoying to me. You really don’t want to attract any attention to this device and people asking what it is for.<br />Some comments on this device being “undetectable”. Plugging this dongle into a USB port will automatically trigger Windows to install a generic optical mouse driver. Be aware that this does not make the jiggler “undetectable”. There are mouse loggers that can detect repetitive and sustained movements, so if you have this thing on and take a 2 hour lunch, you will be docked for taking the 2 hour lunch. There are truly undetectable jigglers out there (Eaxbux makes these as well) – they don’t even connect to your computer, and you just set your mouse on top of them. The movement is randomized, so just about impossible to detect. The only thing is, if someone walks by your desk and sees this, bingo, busted.<br />Overall, this is a useful little device to keep your computer awake, and there are some legitimate uses for it. It’s not a device for the truly paranoid though.",[],B0BJV2449G,B0C6PZJ72M,AH6L6UD7XFKAUVGQGTXH3QHSJBNA,2023-01-29 20:59:12.065,1,False,492
785570,5,Great sound quality and perfect for parties.,"[[VIDEOID:28740d9f4602e20aa7b0ab74ad80001b]] I am speechless.This speaker blew me away. I was really surprised at how great this speaker sounds. I knew it was a cool speaker, but I didn't realize that it sounded this good. We recently had a big party during the holidays and I got so many compliments on this speaker. Everyone wanted to know where I got it.<br /><br />This is the first large party speaker that I have ever owned that came with a remote control. The remote is simple and easy to use. I can pretty much control every function with the remote. It's packed with features.<br /><br />The RGB lights look so cool. The lights are nice and bright and colorful. It has several different light modes. My favorite is the music mode where the lights move to the music.<br /><br />The build quality is great. I will say that this speaker is kinda heavy. It has a carrying handle built-in to the back of it. Now, it would have been nice if it had wheels and a telescopic handle for moving it from place to place.<br /><br />Now for the sound quality. The sound quality is awesome. The bass sounds great and clear with no distortion. It has extra bass modes. To be honest, the speaker right out of the box sounds good even without the extra bass boost on. The mids and highs sound great as well. This speaker really gets loud. It has 160 watts of pure power.<br /><br />Battery life is pretty good. We had a New Years Eve party, and I had it playing at about 50% power with all the lights on, and when the party was over, it still had a battery left. I noticed that It has a battery saving feature. If it doesn't detect any sound, it will automatically shut down to save battery life.<br /><br />It also has dj effects. I really didn't use them because they didn't sound that good to me. But the sound quality makes up for the poor dj effects.<br /><br />Overall, this speaker is AWESOME! If you're looking for a party speaker, look no further. This is all you will need. So far me and my wife and I are really enjoying it. I definitely recommend this speaker.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jkq0ja29L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jkq0ja29L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jkq0ja29L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SN-5g6hZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SN-5g6hZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SN-5g6hZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71b24pyVQ-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71b24pyVQ-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71b24pyVQ-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uukmgdGNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uukmgdGNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uukmgdGNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B1N3WL69,B0BMR281FK,AHSA2ZAAFHZT6G7CODEA34CI653Q,2023-01-06 18:30:52.446,2,False,492

White and Aqua! Styled to look a lot like Apple mouse and keyboard. This makes it a nice compliment to a MAC setup.<br /><br />Price: At $15.00 as of March 2023, a great price!!<br /><br />In the box:<br />Just a keyboard and mouse. USB mini receiver is inside the keyboard battery compartment. No paperwork (we all know how to work a keyboard and mouse by now). Keyboard and mouse each require 2 AAA batteries (not included). Wireless is 2.4 GHz only. No Bluetooth.<br /><br />Mouse has scroll wheel and DPI button, which lets you change DPI (Dots Per Inch) with just a click of that button. There are 3 levels of DPI settings ranging from 800 DPI to 1600 DPI. DPI affects how far the mouse cursor moves on the screen in relation to how far you physically move the mouse itself. For my use the middle setting (1200 DPI) works well.<br /><br />Keyboard has rubber feet on bottom to help keep it from sliding around. Keys have nice springy feel. Instead of a scissor mechanism, the keys are capacitive (somewhat similar to mechanical keys in how they attach). The keys can be removed easily (to clean accidental spills) and put back on. If you have ever removed a scissor style key (or had one come off accidentally) you know how difficult it is to put it back on without breaking it. So this is a real plus to me! My only criticism is that this keyboard is not backlit. But for the price, that is a little much to expect.<br /><br />Sound: This keyboard is not silent. But it has a nice level of ""clickiness"" that I believe most people will like. It is quieter than my mechanical keyboard, which has Gateron brown switches (medium clickiness).<br /><br />Works well with my Panasonic ToughBook CF31 (Windows 10), FZ-55 (Windows 11), MacBook Pro (Monterey), Chromebook, and Raspberry Pi 4B.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714MGNeo48L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714MGNeo48L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714MGNeo48L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EAbFDycIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EAbFDycIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EAbFDycIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Zsj0Pyn7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Zsj0Pyn7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Zsj0Pyn7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KzrSbMqzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KzrSbMqzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KzrSbMqzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BVWK4PF7,B09PZ8W2ZG,AF7AUDVWWXCVUO6NMEWXYWZZ6AMA,2023-03-29 17:35:56.990,0,False,492

I was able to access the website, but the website did not recognize the router's hardware ID and such couldn't log me into the router. Not a great start. I'm experienced in home networking, so I was able to manually get the IP address of the router via the command line and connect into it that way, but your average consumer would've been stuck calling support at this point.<br /><br />Once logged into the router, I applied the firmware update it prompted me for, which seemingly didn't go over well. Speeds slowed to a crawl for downstream traffic, and I was forced to do a factory reset and go through the setup process again. This got the router working again, but the maximum performance it offered was unbelievably weak for an AX (Wi-Fi 6) router, actually slower than AC routers I've used.<br /><br />As the only device connected to the router, my system with an Intel AX wifi chipset ten feet away from the router maxed out at 340 Mbps down. For reference, the not-so-great Netgear router I've had for a few years and was hoping to replace manages 670 Mbps with literally over a dozen other devices connected to the network. That's nearly double the D-Link.<br /><br />Even if the performance were acceptable, the router is missing the incredibly basic feature of having separate SSIDs for the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks. Also missing is the ability to manually select channels if you're trying to avoid interference. The firewall page is very vague on what protection is being offered and there's no help manual on the box and if it's offered through the web interface, it's not easy to find.<br /><br />I guess technically this thing does work as a router so it's worth more than the 1 star rating it would get if it did absolutely nothing, but it really deserves a 1.5 star rating instead of the 2 that I'm giving it.

257102,4,Cute little laptop bag!,"This bag is for small laptops and tablets. I have an asus flipbook and it fits perfectly. But my HP won’t fit. I like that this is a compact bag, as I already have a couple laptop bags that hold tons of stuff. This one is perfect for your tablet or laptop, plus a couple notebooks, magazines, books, or files. Room for the charger and maybe a bottle of water, some pens, and has an internal pocket that will hold your phone and/or sunglasses. There’s a divider inside and one side has a little Velcro tan to hold it closed, which I assume to be the device section, but my laptop didn’t really fit in there. An iPad would fit in that part perfectly. It’s fake leather but it actually looks really nice and could pass for a much pricier brand. Except of course for the fairly large brand tag on the front. I’ve never heard of this brand before so honestly I’d rather not have the tag on the front at all but you’d have to be close to read it and I think the way I carry it my arm will cover it anyway. I love the quilted design, it gives it a classy look. And the green/silver stripe adds a touch of fancy also. There are external pockets on both sides and all of the zippers are high quality and move smoothly and quietly. This bag can be carried either by handles or as a messenger/crossbody bag. I do have one complaint about the strap, and that’s the shoulder pad. You can only slide it as far as the size adjuster, and because they have the slits cut small and not the width of the strap, you cannot side the pad over the metal size adjuster piece no matter how hard you try. So that really limits how long you can make the strap. (It also has the brand imprinted largely on the shoulder pad-this is unnecessary and detracts from the classy look). You can see what I’m referring to in my last photo. And that’s why I deducted one star. You could also use this as a purse or even throw some diapers and wipes in it for a classy daily use diaper bag. Overall it feels and looks like a high quality bag and I think I will get a lot of use out of it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RkDxpL9YL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RkDxpL9YL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RkDxpL9YL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71culZn4x7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71culZn4x7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71culZn4x7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gdb1flofL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gdb1flofL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gdb1flofL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZONZn5WNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZONZn5WNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZONZn5WNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B2C6DTVG,B0B2C6DTVG,AEM6W3ILBY2U4WLIT5AOKS53I53A,2023-02-03 21:32:22.348,0,False,492

For years, I've used a pair of Sony WH-1000 headphones, and now that they are quite worn, I decided to find a new option that was less expensive than top brand Sony. I've only had these for a week, so I can't comment on the longevity of the headphones yet. But otherwise, here are my pros and cons after 1 week of use.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- These have really good sound quality. I was not expecting sound to be so clear at this price point, so I'm very pleased about this!<br />- These are extremely comfortable for people with larger heads/ears, specifically, they fully cover my ears and have enough space around them to accommodate my many ear piercings.<br />- The case is slim and can be attached to a backpack, which I'm thrilled about, especially since I'll be travelling often with these.<br />- I really like the look/style of these headphones, and they look exactly as pictured.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The ANC isn't good, especially when wearing these but not listening to music. It is noticeable, low-grade white noise, which isn't the case for other, more expensive brands. So if you're looking for noise cancelling headphones while not listening to music, these are probably not the right option for you.<br />- I've tested the mic/voice quality, and it is not good; I won't be using these for phone calls and gaming without an external mic, which is fairly common with many over ear headphones anyways, so I'm not too upset by this.<br />- Although these can connect to 2 devices simultaneously, switching between devices leads to some poorer sound quality issues, like 1 second pauses mid-song, inconsistent switching between devices, etc. I have moved back to 1 device connection because of these issues and don't plan to connect 2 devices simultaneously in the future.<br />- Upon opening these, there is a strong, unpleasant plastic smell. Thankfully, it has mostly gone away by now.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase, since it checks most of my requirements for headphones without the price tag of Sony, Bose, or Sennheiser. I would definitely buy these again, as long as they have decent longevity.",[],B0BNL2QKZ6,B0BNL2QKZ6,AEHGEDYBZEM2JUHDHU527JJ7HR3A,2023-03-31 17:12:18.162,3,True,492
261671,4,Faster than EERO 6,"Have both EERO 6 system and this Google system which does not have WIFI 6. Oddly this one (the Google Nest) is faster by quite a bit than the EERO 6. Have not had it long enough to speak to it's tech support quality, or it's stability. But, when the EERO 6 was installed it was blazing fast for maybe a day (over 300 meg down and full 30 meg up). But within a day or 2 the system would slow to 160 or so down and 20+ up. Not terrible but this is where it would stay. Very stable but not the speed promised overall<br />The Google Nest however is a little slower at very top speeds depending on where I am receiving signal. So like the EERO 6 I would see fastest speeds (450/30) when device is closest to the Gateway. However the Google Nest Access Points show stronger/faster speeds 300+/25+ unlike the EERO 6 with 150+/20+ at the access points. So my informal conclusion is the Google Nest access points are faster and stronger than the EERO 6 while the ""base"" or Gateway unit of Google is a little slower than the EERO 6. But here to not by a lot. Topping out at 375+/30+ vs the EERO 6 Gateway topping out at 475+/30+ These results are based on an installation with the Gateway located in my basement oriented to the rear of my home and approximate center of the rear wall, one AP in a front bedroom at another end of the (long ranch style) home on main floor and the 2nd access point located at opposite end of home main floor toward rear of home.<br />Sadly after only about 3 weeks of use things went haywire. Not sure if it is a fault of the product itself or perhaps the reason it was a ""reconditioned"" product. They caused constant interruptions to service. Even knocking the modem itself offline. Leading me to believe the issue was Comcast. A tech came out, he checked signal at my cable end. Said it seemed to be weak. Installed a whole new line, confirmed a good strong signal. Modem, and router(s) were all reset and seemed well until about 10 minutes after he left. Down AGAIN!. Connected my old Unifi WAP and while slower everything is operating normally.

727076,4,"Easy, but use the right code!","Easy Startup when you use the correct code.<br /><br />The smart watch for men by Atevense is perfect for someone looking for an easy link-up to your phone.<br /><br />While I was doing the initial charging of the phone I read through the instruction book.  The instructions were fairly simple – scan the QR code and follow the prompts. I scanned the code inside the instruction book and to finish the registration too the app/website it wanted my credit card information! No way I was going to give them my credit card info. I thought I'd have to give away my brand new smart watch.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't give up right then. I was browsing around the watch menus and noticed on the opening menu an arrow that wanted me to scroll down. So, I swiped up and low & behold there was a QR Code on the digital watch display. Yaay, I was finally in business.<br />Don't make my mistake and scan the code inside the instruction book. Scan the code under the main menu on the phone!<br /><br />After I scanned the code from my phone and was taken to the Google app store (no credit card info needed there). Once I installed the app on my phone it immediately vibrated the watch on my wrist.  The vibration reminded me of  an an old controller rumble-pack. From there it wanted some basic information; height, weight, gender, age. It was that easy. From there I could use my phone or new watch to check my blood pressure, heart rate, blood oxygen level, how I'm sleeping, and how much exercise I've done including a calorie counter.<br /><br />Some more features on the watch allow you to access the weather and move through your phone's music playlist.<br /><br />There are also a bunch of different ways to set your screen. You can view just the time, or all of your health information, or time and weather – I'm guessing you can set up the screen any way you want. There are basic backgrounds, funky backgrounds, futuristic looking ones.  You could have a new/different looking watch everyday for quite awhile.<br /><br />Bonus: The page for the ATEVENSE watch lists the color as Black – but the tan/fatigue watchband was also included in the box.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EyZATRK+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EyZATRK+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EyZATRK+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eNGzEptRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eNGzEptRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eNGzEptRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fgzXOnEFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fgzXOnEFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fgzXOnEFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BRXSM33G,B0BX92M1Z5,AFQOTCWHOUNSIKPQ4P74PPGXOMEA,2023-02-24 00:37:10.063,0,False,492
835739,2,Lack of volume makes this a dismal choice for hearing impaired,"First, my unit arrived obviously previously opened.  The package tape was already cut, and the power supply cord was poorly re-wrapped and tied.  This unit has obviously been returned and resold.  The top of the unit is worn, and the bottom is very scratched and obviously used.  This item should not have been sent back out as ""New,"" but it was.<br /><br />This puts the whole transmitter under suspicion because it was obviously returned after being used for a reason.  One of the Amazon user comments is that the unit's volume diminishes over time.  This is the case with this used transmitter.  The broadcast volume is, at what I would rate as an older person with slight hearing deficiency, at 40%.  It needs a lot more oomph.<br /><br />Is it their matched receiver?  No.  Turn the transmitter off and the matching FM radios emit white noise at such a volume level that it hurts my hearing-deficient ears.  The receivers are not the problem.<br /><br />The broadcast sound (Bluetooth) is of good quality.  It just cannot be made loud enough.<br /><br />The second problem is that the Retekess transmitter/receivers start to break up within 10 feet, if there is an unobstructed sheetrock wall between them.  At 20 feet with 2 sheetrock walls, it fails to work entirely.  The setting on the power switch on the back makes no difference.  The combination behaves the same.  This transmitter has no volume and no power -- this compared to other offerings on Amazon that we own that broadcast 1-5 miles at similar stated power levels.<br /><br />The indicated matching frequencies of the paired Retekess broadcaster and receivers sometimes do not match.  Sometimes a .5 MZH difference will provide a noisy, but much higher volume response when the combination should not work at all.  Obviously, the internal electronics are not purely tuned.<br /><br />Since this unit is obviously a used, returned, item so, we have ordered a replacement.  Hopefully, it will be new, and work as advertised.  We don't mind getting scratched return items like this IF they work properly.  Simply put, this unit does not meet our expectations or our needs for communicating with hearing-impaired people in our church.",[],B091TPFWTK,B091TPFWTK,AGH5KWF6D67N5AOF47A27NSZISWQ,2023-03-21 07:12:59.492,1,True,492
126270,3,The ant shown is not an ANT145 but an ANT130(NEVER OWNED ANYTHING LIKE THE ANT130),"The RCA ANT145 has a dish center that looks like a small sat dish and a 2nd ring around that dish; this ANT130 only has a ring center. And, the ANT145 has more positions for the center knob to turn as well. I've owned a very similar RCA model to the ANT145 in the past: the only differences were it had no 2nd ring, it plugged into the wall(didn't pay any attention at the time but this probably meant it had a built-in amplifier), and you could choose the back coax cable for it(allowing there to be far less inference if you decided to use an average length cord of your own choosing than most soldered on cords or a very, very long coax if you wanted to move the antenna around[had a 25 ft cable]). Differences aside, my version worked well in a tree-infested area that was also 30-100 miles from almost all of the towers.<br /><br />We had no local stations(in the tiny town where I used to live): Macon, MS to Columbus, MS(WCBI--CBS), Macon, MS to Tupelo, MS(WTVA--NBC), Macon, MS to West Point, MS(WLOV--FOX). In addition, the PBS station was around 150 miles away: Macon, MS to Jackson, MS. It must have been a very strong signal, because it came in as clear as you could get before digital and as clear as the 30 mile away station(WCBI). You can check those ranges out to see that I am not lying. For some reason, we could not get the WTOK--ABC station in Meridian, MS(about 60 miles away from us then) with this antenna. The only time I remember ever picking up this channel was with an outdoor antenna setup and turning the pole manually or by using a special box that did the turning for you. Keep in mind, this was in the days before the many OTA channels you can access today(I am guessing that it was sometime within the 2000s decade) and you could only get the major networks at this time. Granted, I did own a very similar one to the ANT145(not the ANT130 that is shown), but 30-100 miles and 150 miles out for one station is not bad in the woods for an indoor antenna!",[],B00005T3A5,B00005T3A5,AHLU37C56LHEU5VLD3G2PEHOJIJA,2023-03-08 08:33:17.201,0,False,492

724250,5,Clear Diffusion Filter with No Noticeable Color Cast,"[[VIDEOID:6a0c20a2c7224d943fbed3f07d451a79]] In a world where we chase the ultimate sharpness in images and video, diffusion filters are a fun getaway from that rat race. This particular filter is, in my opinion, fairly ""low power"" in most situations, so you can safely add it without causing an overpowering effect like many other filters, especially in the budget section. This can be used for portraits to give a slight glowing effect and soften up some of that sharpness while maintaining image detail, or for landscapes to add some glow to any light sources in the scene, along with any variety of scenarios you might come up with. If you have the time, I'd recommend trying it out any chance you have and seeing if you like what it adds to the image. These filters are very subjective and what may work for one person may not for another, and in reverse as well of course.<br /><br />I found this to be most effective when there is some contrast and drama to the light. In the flat midday sun, it was actually difficult in my case to find any difference at all other than some mild softening of the image. However, in my night test, it added a wonderful glow to the various light sources, making the image much more appealing and less harsh.<br /><br />One of the best things I noted about this filter is what it DIDN'T do. I didn't notice any color cast or discoloration caused by this filter. Many other filters struggle with this issue but in anything from midday sun to nighttime darkness, I didn't notice any color shifting (and to clarify, I'm reviewing these on my calibrated BenQ monitor).<br /><br />Two side notes to mention:<br /><br />I now own several different items from K&F and I've been increasingly impressed with this brand of photography products. This filter is definitely going in the camera bag and I will be trying it out as often as possible.<br /><br />Additionally, this filter is packaged in one of the nicest hard cases I've seen. The smoke gray circular case stands amount amongst a sea of white square cases for my other filters, and includes a really neat rubber ""mount"" inside to hold a variety of filter sizes without it flopping around in the case.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Rl-KBQ5bL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Rl-KBQ5bL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Rl-KBQ5bL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715g1sIE0lL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715g1sIE0lL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715g1sIE0lL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71G3WjbpfxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71G3WjbpfxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71G3WjbpfxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BTYQQD6Q,B0BTYT81BZ,AGQL56G4RJBVXHYJVY2U2UULWZOA,2023-03-14 00:55:09.810,3,False,492
61564,2,Be careful of speed claims,"You will NOT get 10Gb/s on any of these ports although you MAY get close to 9Gb/s if you only use two carefully selected ports. Please read on to understand the limitations of these external ports.<br /><br />This card uses a single ASM3142 which supports (in theory) a maximum of two USB3.1 Gen-II (confusing numbering, but these are 10Gb/s) ports - I'll call these internal ports. On the board, each of these two internal ports are shared between 4 of the external ports. The 10Gb/s of the internal port is roughly divided equally between each of the 4 shared external ports (for that particular internal port) that are in use. Thus, if there are three (of 4) external ports in use, each will get roughly 3.3 Gb/s bandwidth. In practical use, there is bandwidth lost in the division process so each port actually works at less than 3Gb/s. Even with only one external port in use, you only approach 9Gb/s. When fully loaded (all 8 external ports across both internal ports), I only got ~2Gb/s on each device. Refer to the manual for which physical external connectors are connected to the same internal 10Gb/s port.<br /><br />I found the card easy to install, physically. Windows 11 recognized it immediately and installed the native Windows driver (the date on this driver is misleading but it is the correct driver). I first tested the speed of each port with nothing else connected to the card. Then I tested the speeds with various combinations of ports in use simultaneously. Regardless of the combination, I found a fair amount of bandwidth loss (10-20%) at the external ports which is probably typical of this chipset.<br /><br />A much bigger issue is the stability of the USB ports. Although the system never lost communication with the ASM3142, it frequently dropped the external USB connections. This did not happen with the same devices connected to ports on a card with an ASM3242 (different card). Sometimes the dropped connections reset, sometimes they didn't. Eventually (within 10 minutes) everything connected to this card just stopped working and was no longer recognized by Windows.<br /><br />After much tinkering, I gave up. I found this card much too unreliable in any configuration. YMMV.",[],B0BJPCVKDR,B0BJPCVKDR,AHITJ25MNRPIUIWGYFFESLCC5TNQ,2023-03-05 17:41:46.243,1,True,492

We use Mac computers for our engineering group and Windows for the regular business side.  We wanted to add a computer on a kiosk in the waiting room where customers could come in and look at films of some of our testing over the years.  So, it was important to have Wireless capability for the network and for the keyboard/mouse and that the form factor be small.<br /><br />When this became available, I decided to give it a try.  Here is what I found:<br /><br />1.  This is larger than I expected and much better build.  Guess I was expecting a cheap plastic box but was surprised by the build of this one.<br /><br />2.  It includes a VESA mount that allows you to mount this to the monitor.  We used a 4K 28 inch TV as it was the perfect size and it was inexpensive.  It was easy to bolt on and to run the short HDMI cable.  The only cable leaving the monitor was the power cord.  We used a wireless keyboard and mouse.<br /><br />3.  We did not put it into a case yet because we wanted to test it out first and then give the guys in the machine shop a lunch time project.<br /><br />4.  Now, comes the dreaded UPDATE cycle!!!

Regardless of how tightly I turned the screws, the shoe would ""twist"" whenver it was touched, so it made using the dot sight a pain, because I'd have to re-align it often.<br /><br />Then I saw this Smallrig half-cage, and when it is attached to the A7iv, it has an area in front of the normal A7iv viewfinder that has one 3/8"" hole in the center and a 1/4"" hole on each side of trhe center 3/8"" hole.  It was a bit unfortunate that the center hole was 1/4"", but I found a 1/4""-to-3/8"" adapter (it was Camvate) so I used that to mount a Smallrig cold shoe, and then the Nikon dot sight mounts on teh cold shoe.<br /><br />Works perfectly, and the dot sight is not too much off the camera compared to if the dot sight was mounted directly into the A7iv hot shoe, and it is stable now.<br /><br />The cage screw into the tripod mount on the bottom plate of the A7iv, but it also is designed so that it has a 2nd attachment point to the left side camera strap lug.  You have to remove the triangular ring from the left lug, and then remove the rearmost 2.5mm screw that is screwed into the cage side.  Then loosen the front 2.5mm screw and slide that part back until it contacts the front of the left lug and take the screw that you removed through the lug.  The whole thing is very stable.  You can then attach your strap through a slot that is on the left side of the camera, instead of through the left lug.<br /><br />It also comes with a tool that is magnetically attached to the bottom of the cage.<br /><br />Since this is half-cage, the door for the memory cards is accessible.  Same thing for the battery door on the bottom.<br /><br />The main ""con"" is that you have to remove the ring from the left lug.",[],B09P5BNKRW,B09P5BNKRW,AGCTIIIB3WVL3DR34UCNR6A3W2SA,2023-01-08 04:43:23.649,0,True,492
530752,4,"Good headset, with some quirks","Ordered this headset as a replacement for one my microphone broke on. I don't game much, but I am on a LOT of Zoom calls throughout the work day.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the long cord, with a cable wrap included. It offers plenty of length and I love that it is able to be organized well. The cord is heavy duty and seems to be well designed.<br /><br />The headset seems to be of a good build quality. The microphone comes in loud enough to hear and is easily configured to fit you. The best part is people don't complain when I talk during meetings anymore...it's good at isolating sound out. I work in an office with 7 other people and have customers come in and out during the time and the microphone has done fantastic at keeping it to only my voice for the most part. The fit for the headset works well for my head and requires no time to get setup as it customizes automatically for your head. My one complaint is the ear pads are a bit stiff and take some getting used to/breaking in. I've had others that are much quicker to adapt to my ears, but these aren't as large so my ears aren't always fully covered which may be the reason they don't fit so comfortably.<br /><br />This headset claims full 7.1 surround sound....hard to believe since it only has 2 speakers. It does appear to have better sound quality than others I have used, and some surround sound effects to some degree. One thing that is cool is you can adjust the front, back, side, center, and sub levels with the provided inline control. Here you can also mute the mic and/or adjust the volume as a whole.<br /><br />Overall, I think these headphones fit the bill for a good set for Zoom calls and even gaming. The cord could be an issue potentially if you don't plan for it...but if you want wireless headsets then it's not fair to compare it to a wired pair. I do recommend making sure the fit works well for you....I'm not sure I could wear these all day long but have easily worn it for 3-4 hours in a day without issue. For the price, you won't find a better set. I recommend these headphones to anyone looking to get something of good quality but doesn't want to spend a lot of money.",[],B0BTHTK125,B0BTHTK125,AG6BXIXRKSN64D42VCTR3L72ZZXQ,2023-03-29 12:16:47.783,0,False,492
366017,2,Misleading Information in Production Description,"While the device was easy to setup and connect to my wireless network, it doesn't correctly match the description - WiFi to Ethernet Adapter - at least not without other baggage.  Let me explain.<br /><br />There are two operating modes of the device:<br />1) WiFi extender<br />2) WiFi access point<br /><br />In the extender mode, it attaches to your existing WiFi network wirelessly and then re-broadcasts its own network.  While in this mode, you can attach a wired device to the ethernet port.  That's fine, but I really ONLY wanted to attach a wired device and not broadcast another network on both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz which adds more congestion to the airwaves.  You can ""hide"" the SSID for both of the re-broadcasted extended networks but there is no option to turn them off.  Furthermore, there are no adjustments allowed for channel selection or channel width - I guess it just picks whatever it wants.<br /><br />In the access point mode, the ethernet port is connected to your existing wired network and then it acts like another access point in your house.  OK, that might be helpful for some people but I already have multiple access points so that doesn't help me and is not why I purchased it based on the description.<br /><br />But the biggest issue is that the wired ethernet port is limited to the older ""Fast Ethernet"" standard of 10/100 Mbps.  That is fine for a printer, and even for a TV, but not for other devices where you might actually want to take advantage of the fast WiFi speeds.  So whether you use this as an access point or as an extender just know that any network traffic going over the  wired port will be capped at 100 Mbps.  Doesn't make sense to support the AC1200 standard on the WiFi side of things and then create a bottleneck at the wired port. It really makes no sense as Gigabit ethernet chipsets for wired connections have been around for years and cost next to nothing.<br /><br />PROS:  Easy setup.  Affordable price.<br /><br />CONS:  No controls in the web interface to adjust how the device is working to disable unused/unwanted features.  Wired port is limited to 100 Mbps of throughput.",[],B0118SPFCK,B0118SPFCK,AE2O5BWPYZYMFFNGL2NTLW2HKWBA,2023-02-25 22:55:49.019,1,True,492

We have an 8 year old and 12 year old so reliable communication is absolutely necessary.<br /><br />First: the range is a complete lie. We were lucky to maintain 4 way communication up to 300 feet. The 1.6 kilometer claim is simply absurd. Maybe in a desert, with a clear line of sight, but not in a forested region with hills.<br /><br />Next, one of the fixed microphones failed completely after only 3 days of use. What the heck? I'm on a snowmobiling vacation and I have one helmet with no Mic.<br /><br />Next, there was never a time when all of us could hear each other with saying. ""What?"" ""Say that again"" ""Did you hear me?!!""<br /><br />My old Sena suffered from crackling sound and refused to update, and the majority of reviews suggested that Cardo was the best. NO WAY. In real world use, on the trail, in snowstorms, I can say that all four of us were very disappointed, and that's putting it mildly.  keep in mind, that's just for the 4 way Digital Mesh Communication, which is all we care about.  Listening to music and taking calls, etc., mean nothing when the most basic function fails.<br /><br />I've had to factory reset 3 times in 4 days just to keep a semblance of communication,  and my finger-tips are sore from how harsh the buttons are to press trying to achieve the factory reset.<br /><br />I feel I was completely duped out of nearly $1000.00.<br /><br />Anyone that wrote a story, a review, or magazine column extolling the virtues of these communicators for snowmobiling either never used them for that purpose for more than a few minutes under perfect conditions, or is was simply disingenuous. Either way, their journalistic license should be suspended and or revoked!<br /><br />I should have followed my gut and upgraded with the latest Sena, or maybe Uclear.<br /><br />I would absolutely NOT recommend these communicators to anyone, even the people I don't like.",[],B07MYB95SX,B0B88DKBB2,AEKDJYDX2Z5N3KC5JTDIBY6GXLAA,2023-03-04 00:28:43.571,0,True,492

Well if you want a head unit in your car/truck that work like an android tablet then this is the one you want! The Atoto S8 Ultra Gen 2 is pack with a lot of features and the touch screen display is very responsive. This is the best of the best car stereo out there folk!! You can spend up to $1,000 - $2,000 on a known brand car stereo like Sony, Pioneer, Kenwood, Boss, etc. but you won't find anything like what the Atoto S8 Ultra Gen 2 has. What make this unit quite unique is that you have the ability to access to the internet and you have the ability to download pretty much anything you wanted! You can download app like Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video & so much more. You can even play game on this thing! This unit will make your old/new car act like a smart car.<br /><br />This stereo + the CA-AEC02 was a gife for my father's truck. My father said he loved it. That great which is what i wanted to hear =). I also love it and now my sister also wanted one for her car. I will start recommending it to more friends and family members. I think it is better than a lot of top quality known brand car stereos out there. You're pretty much restricted to what you can do with them but with the Atoto S8 Ultra Gen 2 they gave you the freedom to fully download/customize what you want on it which is what I really like. If you want a head unit that act like a smart car then you got to go with ATOTO! You won't be disappointed!<br /><br />Now I heard the S8 Gen 3 will be release. I'm excited. I hope it packs with a lot more ram, better cpu & gpu. If the S8 Ultra Gen 3 come out with an Oled 4k display than it is an instant buy for me. I believe this could be the #1 brand car stereo for the foreseeable future.

383739,4,Lot's of handy pockets in front and back.  Lot's of room inside for long weekend or flights.,"I really love this backpack, but it's not the perfect laptop travel backpack.  It is a larger backpack that would serve many purposes for someone needing to carry a lot of things comfortably.  They have really designed this for the regular traveler.  It is perfect for a long weekend away or plane, train, bus trip.<br /><br />The front panel has 3 very nice sized pockets designed for travel documents, books, medicine, hand sanitizer, etc.  Each side has a pocket for cold or warm drinks that are lined with silver insulation material.  (Genius!)  The front zip open section folds out flat and is an open section for clothing, etc.  It also has an elastic cross-strap to hold all of your clothes down securely.<br /><br />There is a nice sized pocket for a USB Powerbank in the front section which you can connect to on the outside via a USB cable.  Unfortunately, it only has a USB-A connection on the inside by the Powerbank and a USB-A connection on the outside.  Oddly, it looks like the outside connection has a location for a USB-C port, but it hasn't been installed.  (See photo.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, the smaller back section, which is designed for your laptop, does not zip all the way down and open up flat like the front.  I think the TSA requires you to have a backpack open up all the way with the laptop visible.  Otherwise, you have to remove your laptop when going through scanners now.  (I could be wrong, I haven't flown since pre-Covid.)  This section though is very large and easily fits my 15"" laptop, my 12"" tablet, my headphones, and some of my accessories.  I'm sure it would fit a 17"" laptop like the description states.<br /><br />Overall, I still like this backpack, even with its faults.  It's the perfect size, comfortable, and holds a lot of things for a trip.  It appears to be very well made of quality materials.  I also think it is priced well when compared to some of the others out in Amazonland.  I hope to see them come out with a newer model in the near future that has USB-A and USB-C connections and the laptop section can lay out flat when opened.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7193wDBKjyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7193wDBKjyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7193wDBKjyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fwZaaJPHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fwZaaJPHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fwZaaJPHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zlQvnyo6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zlQvnyo6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zlQvnyo6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/815wHS2jFuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/815wHS2jFuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/815wHS2jFuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81DlV4ShrAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81DlV4ShrAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81DlV4ShrAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81tsjoIvkgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81tsjoIvkgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81tsjoIvkgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B63PX1JL,B09SB1R1D1,AFS7VS3EUKQG5KFAMEQDEO5H5GEQ,2023-01-08 05:36:49.365,1,False,492
105692,5,Great Security Monitor for the Price,"[[VIDEOID:6d3560b5ffaf0381bb53f82c4a96484b]] I like this bulb security camera (2-pack) because it was super easy to setup, install and operate. I like the app -- even though it is a bit rough at times -- because I was able to figure it out without any documentation. Setting up the camera was pretty much a no-brainer and I've been running it for couple of days with zero issues (except for those of my own making via the MANY settings in the app).<br /><br />I was able to get it on my home wifi (I have blended 2.4 & 5 gHz, so not sure which band it is on at any time) and downloading photos and videos from the app is seamless and fast (they reside on the 128gb micro-SD TF card I had laying around (the max size it accepts) and these download very quickly from the camera on the back porch to the other side of my house where I am typing this.<br /><br />I will say when I opened the rubber waterproof hatch to insert the TF card, it looked like I was doing brain surgery in there as there were visible circuit boards, which I didn't want to see -- and it was not clear how to insert the TF card, but I figured it out eventually.<br /><br />So far the only thing I do not like is that it does not integrate with my smart home (we have Apple, Alexa and Google), so I have to use the app to access photos/video...but as mentioned above, the app works okay for that, as we are really only interested in what has happened (e.g., people at the pool) rather than receiving *urgent* alerts, which the app does not provide (as far as I have found so far).<br /><br />I also like how the camera tracks movement very well (there are yellow boxes around people it is tracking -- see video) and seems to have almost infinite ability to see/record up, down, and around.<br /><br />I am currently using only one of the two cameras, but like it well enough to be thinking where to install the other.<br /><br />UPDATE: It does do alerts on my iPhone...it pays to keep playing with those settings in the app!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YMEQKttML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YMEQKttML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YMEQKttML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YO-mEXCFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YO-mEXCFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YO-mEXCFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gpUmSlfqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gpUmSlfqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gpUmSlfqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HkFnZ7CpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HkFnZ7CpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HkFnZ7CpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BJJHSXH3,B0BVBK2W1L,AFYCCNGPYJKUCSZWW2FDRATIEULA,2023-02-04 20:08:43.138,0,False,492

I am not a super tech savvy person, but there are little things that I look for in a computer. I want it to be touchscreen, have a keypad, have a backlit keyboard, and enough speed and memory that I am not dealing with having to delete things all the time or dealing with crashes. That is what I thought this computer would be. I have bought 3 laptops off of Amazon and never had an issue like this.<br />Main cons-<br />- Who thought of putting the charging port there? The cord is constantly slipping out and I have to do weird maneuvers for the laptop to even charge. This is an HP design flaw and it is awful. I can't blame this on the third party who did the upgrades, but it is an issue with my purchase.<br />- It constantly freezes and I have to shut it down and restart it.<br />- Constantly needs to update and these updates take forever.<br />- The battery has no life. Once unplugged it lasts about an hour. I am sure before the upgrades it was better. This is one of my main issues for upgrading a computer past its ability.<br />- If it dies, it takes forever to turn on. I have had a black screen multiple times and have to keep shutting of and restarting to get it to eventually come on.<br /><br />This leads me to the seller who performed these upgrades. Why? Why make these upgrades that you as a professional should know that a computer like this cannot handle. It is honestly shameful and I can't imagine a lot of people are happy with your company. It's one thing to make upgrades that actually enhance the computer, it is another to make it seem like more of a machine than it is possible to be.<br /><br />I am returning this and I have gone to the HP site and built my own with the current config of this one and only paid $100 more. SO WORTH IT.<br />I will not buy a computer of off Amazon again and I think Amazon should really look into some of their third party sellers.<br />Look at the ratings for this and that should answer you question.<br />Also, yes, I know I should have read the reviews.

588783,5,Works As Advertised,"As a part-time podcaster, I sometimes work ""on-location"". I needed an internet connection for a remote production... but of course, the closest ethernet jack was across the street! Adalov's 5.8G wireless bridge solved my dilemma. Adalov says this bridge has a range of up to almost a mile. That's much farther than I was prepared to test. But in all cases, the transmitter and receiver work best ""line of sight""- meaning they should be able to ""see"" each other, with no obstructions in between. For my setup, that simply meant second-floor windows. This kit is 'plug-n-play', right out of the box- the two transceivers come already paired. I say transceivers because each unit in Adalov's kit can be the transmitter, or the receiver- with just the flip of a switch. The bridge components get power via PoE (Power over Ethernet), and in-line power injectors are included- but each needs an AC outlet. An important note: There are two specs provided, regarding data/throughput speed over the bridge. The transmitter and receiver can ""talk"" to each other at up to 450mbps, but at the ethernet ports which complete the bridge- on either side, max data speed is 100mbps. So, your data speed using the bridge is 100mbps. However, that's enough bandwidth for streaming at 4K... on as many as four devices- simultaneously! For my operation, I connected each end of the bridge to ethernet switches- one supplying my internet connection, the other allowing me to connect several devices at the receiving end. Everything worked flawlessly. As I mentioned previously, the bridge is 'plug-n-play', out of the box. If signal strength appears low, there are 8-channels the bridge can operate on- each easily selected via a simple button push, on each device. Of course for ""power users"", the bridge is configurable for IP address, network domain, user name and passwords as well. Lastly, the transmitter and the receiver are weather-resistant, however the power injectors are not- so for permanent installs, longer ethernet cables than the ones supplied with the kit (for use between the transceivers and the injectors) will likely be needed. To sum up, this bridge works as advertised!",[],B0BVLYXVV1,B0C6K6W89Z,AE5RZ4YAQ4LSRNZZ7ZHQYDLPY2TA,2023-04-08 02:43:11.542,8,False,492
816443,5,Excellent wireless bluetooth headphones,"I regularly used wired headphones when I wanted to privately listen to music on my phone or tablet, and since I've done so for ages, back to my days long ago on a portable radio, cassette player, or digital audio (MP3) player, the dangling wire never bothered me. As such, I'll honestly admit that I viewed these kind of wireless devices as frivolous devices of extravagance. Especially considering the ridiculous prices certain brands are marketed as. However, I like gadgets, so when the opportunity came to try these out, I certainly seized the chance. So, what can I say now? I'm a huge fan, these are fantastic, and at the price point these sell at, it proves you don't need to spend ridiculous amounts of money for a good pair of wireless headphones. Actually, for the price of a really good pair of wired headphones, these are very impressive for what you get.<br /><br />The sound quality is very good. Of course, you have to trade-off something to get this kind of portability and freedom of movement, so you are not going to get the kind of broad sound you can get from an excellent pair of wired over the ear headphones. But considering the size of these, wow, you come surprisingly close. Despite the claims of excellent bass response, I have to temper that with while they sound great, excellent bass you can feel, not just hear. That's the one area where headphones this small just are not going to bend the laws of physics, no matter what the price or marketing department tells you. But for zoning out to your tunes while working, well, these are top notch.<br /><br />My only complaints with these so far are that the controls are a little overly sensitive. I see other have made the same comments and maybe this is something they will be able to correct over time. I find the controls are intuitive, but it sometimes misinterprets a single, double, or triple touch. Given the small size, I know this must of been quite an engineering challenge to build these and get the good performance and nearly invisible controls all into this package. The tiny little instruction booklet will certainly get lost, so I reformatted a copy from their website, along with the missing instructions for the ear-tips (pads), and uploaded a copy here.<br /><br />I'm now a convert, and these are highly recommended!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711R0ng+X7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711R0ng+X7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711R0ng+X7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BDQNBMZX,B0BRL5KJ96,AH4VBRJIVL62M5Z4PYWKYPN7G65A,2023-01-09 04:23:03.996,0,False,492

It took about 1.5 seconds to start charging. This is about 3x longer than any other charger I own, including 3rd party manufactered ones. I cannot attest to the long term reliability of the item. The fact that it worked for the 5 minutes I tested, as well as the general functional useful nature of a single cable to charge both my phone and watch while travelling, are the only pros of this charging cable.<br /><br />The magnet in the watch charging pod is weak, I would say about half the strength of the standard apple charger. If used while travelling, and if the cable is required to fight gravity while plugged into an available outlet location at whatever location you're staying, it seemed to me incredibly likely it could become dislodged.<br /><br />The length of the cable is technically 6', from the absolute tip of the usb-c charger, to the absolute tip of the watch charger. However, the lighting cable end is only 71.5 inches in total length, because the magnetic watch pod extends a half inch past the end of the lightning cable. As a comparison, when you buy an apple cable, and they advertise that it's 1 meter in length, that doesn't include the connectors. You actually get just over a meter in actual, usable, cable length.<br /><br />Overall, because I received a clearly used item, and due to the lack of strength of the magnet in the watch charger, I wouldn't recommend buying this item.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BNK+s6nTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BNK+s6nTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BNK+s6nTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09TR8ST19,B0C1ZG1D83,AHEYGJBRKLTXNBLJQGH5SZSUNYIQ,2023-02-11 20:13:38.602,1,False,492

877040,5,Looking for a Raspberry Pi?,"I found some software that fills a personal need, and which recommends 4 cores and 4GB memory, and decided to build a small system using a Raspberry Pi. But if you're here, I'm sure you know what the market is like for Pis.<br />Renegade is comparable to a Pi, and possibly even better in some regards, as a tiny home server. I paired it with a 128GB Samsung MicroSD (a bit overkill for the application; Raspbian Lite OS image is under 1.5GB), a 5.25V / 3.5A micro USB power supply (a bit overkill for this board, but I wasn't going to wait to find out later if there are power stability issues), and a compatible case.<br />From unboxing to first Raspbian Lite boot took around 30 minutes, and most of that time was spent getting the board installed correctly in the case - and also getting the board out of the anti-static bag without breaking a pin. Connected with ethernet, an initial ""sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade"" took only a few minutes, and I was able to install Docker from its repo without any issues.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, it's recommended to have a good working knowledge of Linux because the official OSes are all Linux distros and you can do a lot with that knowledge alone. The website and general support seem to have improved a bit since some of the reviews here but it is still subpar to Raspberry Pi, and there is still definitely not as large of a community behind it.<br /><br />I have more to do with this project but so far I'm very satisfied with my purchase of the Renegade at 1/4 the current price of a Raspberry Pi 4B. I've also bought another board to tinker with and am already planning to buy a few more for running a k8s cluster on dedicated small hardware at home, rather than just tinkering with kind on my gaming PC. But having 1 or 2 of those 8GB models would be pretty nice, too.<br /><br />P.S. Amazon: The ""Touch Screen"" feature rating is a very poor choice for this product.

771931,2,"Worked for 11 Months, made a zapping noise when plugged in and burning smell followed","I had this for adapter for 11 months. I’ve been using it for a Hollywood styled make up mirror. I was very happy with it’s performance and the length of the cable for my setup. The adapter worked well up until recently.<br /><br />I had been rearranging some cords around my desk when the mirror the adapter was hooked up to began to flicker like a strobe light. I did some trouble shooting to determine if it was the cable or the mirror malfunctioning. When I didn’t touch the square, ribbed area of the cord coming out of the unit, the mirror lights worked fine. When moving it slightly, a metal clipping noise can be heard (and felt) and the mirror lights began to flicker again. Trying to move the cable around and the ribbed area didn’t fix the lights while they were strobe-like; I had to unplug the adapter and replug it back it to test it more.<br /><br />I speculated if the wiring to the circuit board was knocked loose. This unit doesn’t come with screws so opening it up isn’t easy. While still troubleshooting, I tried plugging it into a different outlet. When I plugged it into the mirror, I heard a subtle “zap” noise and could smell plastic burning. I freaked out and turned off the outlet from my breaker box before approaching it. I threw it away because it was making my house smell bad. I tried searching for a way to contact the company to see if they’d send me a new one for free but I couldn’t find anything. Amazon makes it pretty difficult to contact sellers unless it’s from a fairly recent order.<br /><br />I’d say this might be one of those “you get what you paid for” moments. It was a cheap adapter for a small amount of usage. I’d expect a cord like this to last a lifetime with proper care which it was given. The construction of the housing could use some work along with accessibility to the components. I guess it would make sense for a cheap product to never be opened and only closed once upon manufacture. It was working fine up until recently and I was hoping I wouldn’t have to make a yearly $10 purchase to keep my make mirror functional.",[],B00Q2E5IXW,B0C1YHZNH9,AGZCLQCMB44B2ITOC3OSMG7UGBKQ,2023-01-16 09:46:02.401,1,True,492
166184,5,Great Keyboard - Nice Connectivity Options,"I have to say first impressions of this keyboard were not great. It comes in a flimsy cardboard box with some thin plastic end caps for protection. The included cable and dongle were in a smaller flimsy box inside, no manual was included. The box got a little squished in transit and the dongle was just rattling around inside and could easily have exited the box and become lost! I'm all for minimalist eco friendly packaging but this keyboard and it's accessories were not adequately packaged.<br /><br />Having extracted it from the poor packaging the keyboard is quite delightful. The white keys and silver metal looks great and match the metal case of my Gigabytes Aero laptop perfectly. Connecting was super easy, just plug in the included dongle and it just gets recognized by Windows and just works. To connect via Bluetooth you just press the #1 or #2 Bluetooth key and it goes straight into pairing mode. Switching devices (you can connect 3) is really easy, you just press the appropriate key at the top right of the keyboard.<br /><br />The construction is sturdy, the keyboard has some weight to it but not excessively so. The scissor type keys are light and positive, it's a nice keyboard to type on. Backlighting is nice, it lights up the legend and the outline of the keys. It took me a while of trial and error to discover that you can change the backlight color by pressing the ""Fn"" key and the dedicated backlight key. Backlighting can be off or one of three levels. After 30 sec of inactivity the backlighting turns off to save battery.<br /><br />The keyboard is charged from a USB-C connection, a USB-A to USB-C cable is provided.<br /><br />One little word of warning, I had to re-type this review after accidentally pressing the key on the top right hand side of the keyboard. This sent the page to a new blank tab... hitting back didn't recover my text! I'm not quite sure of what this key is supposed to do since it didn't open a new tab. This was really quite annoying.<br /><br />I very nearly deducted a star from my review due to the inadequate packaging and the lack of any instructions (I searched the web and didn't find any either).

953268,5,10 months... still satisfied,"I bought my first R3 camera almost 10 months ago now, right after they came out and not long after a driver backed into my new car at a red light (and ignored my horn because, as she said, ""People honk all the time so I just didn't pay any attention to it""). In that case, the at-fault driver admitted fault, but I realized how easy it would have been for her to lie and make me look like the guilty party. So I ordered my first Rove dashcam the next day and have since installed them in each of our family vehicles: two R3s and two R2-4Ks.<br /><br />I've been very satisfied with this camera system. I've rewired a couple of times to get the wiring path I'm most comfortable with in my car. Our other R3 even wired nicely into our old Honda Odyssey with sufficient cable to find a hidden path from back to front. All the cameras have stayed in place well through very hot and very cold weather. The video quality is pretty good. I mean, it's a tiny dashcam, but it's good for what it is. Recently, a truck going the opposite direction on a 2-lane highway dropped a rock on my windshield, and I was able to pull the footage just fine except...I couldn't get my phone's app to connect to the dashcam's Wi-Fi. I ended up having to pull the SD card and get the file from it with my laptop.<br /><br />I emailed the company earlier this week for help and heard back within 24 hours. Alphie was very helpful. He asked for a screen recording of the problem I was having, was able to diagnose the problem right away, and helped me fix it (turns out, I was using the old app, not the new one--not a difficult problem to fix but certainly was not obvious to me). He continued the conversation through to its completion, even responding to my final email where I gave him feedback on the product.<br /><br />So far, I'm glad I chose Rove dashcams for our cars. These devices are worlds better than the old dashcam I tried to use years ago and finally gave up on it.

279136,2,"Nothing but problems, problems, problems.","I knew what I was getting into with this watch. I didn’t want a full smart watch—I’ve had an Apple Watch in the past and it just wasn’t for me. I wanted a fitness tracker that could accurately track heart rate, sleep, and my heart health. In theory this watch should be perfect, but I’m four months into owning this, and it’s been nothing but problems from day one.<br /><br />First of all, as many others had noted, the heart rate tracking is unbelievably off. My personal trainer actually laughs at some of the numbers it gives me. 10 minutes on the stair master? 72 bpm. Driving in the car on an empty road? 190bpm. 15 minutes on the rowing machine? 82 bpm. Lying down reading a book? 145bpm. A set of PR squats? 68 bpm. I’ve tried wearing it on the other arm, wearing it on different spots on my arm, cleaning the sensor, changing the tightness—nothing but incredibly inaccurate readings. This inaccuracy on a simple measurement like heart rate makes me question the accuracy of the ECG—which was a real selling point for me.<br /><br />The other infuriating thing is how buggy the connectivity to the app is. This isn’t my first FitBit, and I’ve grown to really appreciate the app over the years, but I can only use it if my watch actually syncs—which it almost never does! I lose connectivity to the app every 2-3 days, and it just sticks on “Sync is taking a while. Sit tight” for literally ever. Days if I let it. The only way to reconnect it is to remove the device from the app and my phone’s Bluetooth, and then do a factory reset on the watch itself—less than ideal, obviously.<br /><br />Because my watch almost never syncs, I can’t see any of my sleep data. So all the reasons I purchased this watch aren’t functioning for me, which means I’m basically just wearing it now as a $300 “dumb” watch and that really grinds my gears.<br /><br />After many loyal years, I think I’m done with FitBit after this one.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41uQiMct45L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41uQiMct45L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41uQiMct45L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619eozzBPlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619eozzBPlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619eozzBPlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B4N2T7GL,B0BGK8R2SG,AGT5WRBP6IYGVGCJLDQ6F2UXVAZQ,2023-01-23 01:50:51.590,0,False,492
410961,1,This fancy new ATX 3.0 PSU was dead on arrival,"I was excited to finally get my hands on this unit as it was one of the first ATX 3.0 PSUs with the 12VHPWR port to power the 4000-series Nvidia GPUs without the clutter of adapter dongles, to come to market from a normally very trusted brand in the PC component world (MSI).  I've had MSI motherboards, graphics cards, laptops, and they've always been well made and reliable after years of use, so I expected the same from this PSU.  Sadly, this was not the case.  Perhaps MSI quality control has gone down, or maybe I've finally struck some bad luck for once.  This PSU would not even power on after installing it on a new build.  I should've tested it before spending hours on the build but since I had so much faith in MSI as a brand, I didn't and that was my bad.  I did not buy this from amazon but rather from a reputable b&m computer store who tested this PSU when I returned it and confirmed it was indeed dead out of the box.  So sad.  I had high hopes for this beast.  On the positive side, I will say that this MSI MEG Ai1000p looked very well-built and was nicely packaged and included some decent cables including the 12VHPWR stamped with ""600W"" on the connectors.  It was also dead silent when I turned it on, but that's probably because it was just dead :)<br /><br />Anyhow, I didn't want to roll the dice with MSI on a PSU again so instead of getting a replacement of the same model, I decided to try Silverstone HELA1200R and beQuiet DarkPower 13 1000W.  Both were in stock at amazon and delivered quickly so I got a chance to try both.  Unlike this MSI unit, those other 2 PSUs worked like a champ out of the box.  I decided to keep the DarkPower 13 over the HELA1200R simply because it seemed better built, was a lot quieter even under full load, and was slightly more efficient with a 80 Plus Titanium rating versus the 1200R's Platinum rating.  The 1200R might have higher wattage capacity, but at 1000w the DarkPower 13 already seems to provide ample juice for my specific gaming build (7950x + 4090 with just mild overclocking).",[],B0B433KXLJ,B0B433KXLJ,AF36E5EWU4MLLZBRN62PMQZVM2ZA,2023-03-15 18:58:46.723,0,False,492
858885,5,"I thought I made a mistake ordering this, but now I love it!","[[VIDEOID:9518666ad4d8e42e4283407d03cf5a4a]] I originally ordered this little side monitor for a smaller laptop I have to get a little more screen real estate. After I received it, it dawned on me that the laptop I wanted to use is a 2-in-1 style that can fold up to be used as more of a tablet. The mounting plate for the back of the laptop would interfere with closing the laptop up for use as a tablet. It still closed mostly on a test fit, but felt odd being partway open. Oops, I thought.<br /><br />Then I realized this little monitor can be used as a self-standing monitor, making it very useful for me. I can use it with several different computer setups I have whenever I need some extra screen. Since it's USB powered, I can even use it in my campervan.<br /><br />One issue I had is that for the life of me, I can't remove the baseplate (has the double sided tape) from the monitor arm. I see how it slides in, but it won't come loose even with a pretty good amount of force. I don't want to really force it since I don't think the hinge would take it. If it's some sort of intelligence test, I failed miserably. There's even a video on how to remove it, and it slides right off and back on again in the video. Mine won't budge. I'll look at it again with fresh eyes later. Fortunately it doesn't matter anymore now that I'll be using the mount/hinge assembly as a stand.<br /><br />The angle of the monitor can be changed by moving the mount/hinge in or out as desired. Pretty slick! If the monitor is flipped/rotated over to move the ports to the other side, the image flips automatically. It comes with excellent documentation and instructions but nothing about removing that darn baseplate.<br /><br />This monitor will come in very handy in my little photo studio and can be set on table next to a client so they can see what I see in my computer when shooting tethered (camera is controlled by the computer).

317533,4,Great bang for buck unless you want top production value,"The Nisheng 1080p camera comes with a monitor clip, mini tripod, USB cable, USB-A (female) to USB-C (male) adapter, adhesive privacy cover, and a paper manual. They're organized securely in a custom plastic frame in a white box with basic graphic of the camera and is attractive enough to give as a present.<br /><br />Installation is plug and play, couldn't be easier. The camera delivers more than good enough picture quality. You can let it automatically manage the settings or you can dive in, disable it, and do it yourself. I opted for the latter as I fine-tune it better as lighting conditions change throughout the day. It can compensate for backlighting. Color reproduction/auto white balance is satisfactory. It is fixed focus so you have to move to where it is optimal if you want to look crisp. It has a pretty decent range from close to 5 feet from it. Surprisingly it's capable of 60 FPS. You'll want hardware encoding on your computer to take advantage of that (pretty much any Intel machine made after 2015, or if you have a gaming-oriented video card).<br /><br />There is no way this has 80 degree angle of view; their own example meeting room picture shows no more than 35 degrees. I'm estimating it somewhere between 35 and 40 degrees. So it's fine for one or two people and possibly an intimate third, but get something else if you want to run larger group meetings.<br /><br />The privacy cover is an adhesive affair. It's obviously not as good as if it were designed into the camera itself but it works well enough.<br /><br />The microphone quality is surprisingly good. It's a condenser of course, and it picks up everything in the room. It's on the bright side. It's easy to exceed its range so keep the input setting low (it was on 22 by default).<br /><br />The mini tripod has two height settings. It can support the webcam and it has a standard 1/8"" mount but it can't support a contemporary phone. The clip is hinged to accommodate most monitor situations.

419212,2,Great Dream Turned Into Nightmare,"Looking at this case you would think the thermals would be fantastic - not. Started with a i7-11700K in a MSI ITX B560 MB. Using 2 -120mm Noctua 1800rpm fans on top and 120-15mm on the bottom because that is all that would fit. Got the unit to post but at idle it wouldn't go below 55° C with fans at 80%. Changed the 2 Noctua 120mm on top to their Industrial versions which spin at 3000 rpm and that got it down to 51° C at idle. Only found 2 coolers that would fit because the PCIe 3.0 (why 3.0, that's a different subject) has to wrap around the 92mm 15mm thick fan which obviously blocked the airflow - but the be quite & Noctua gave same temps.<br /><br />OK start over - ripped the unit apart and went to a i5-11600K processor. Completely reassembled and now it idled at 49°C. I should have prefaced this with the dictum we deliver our builds at - they cannot idle above 35° C because that will usually translate to an acceptable temp under heavy load. Now under moderate load, this unit shot up to 76° in a few minutes.<br /><br />Obviously, this case will never leave our shop this way. So just for our own volition we ripped it down again and equipped it with a Thermaltake Ultra 240 Liquid unit. Leaving the i5 processor this got the thermals down to 38®C but by doing that we lost the two exhaust fans on top so there was only one 120mm 15mm thick fan intake. Now the processor temp was ""acceptable"" but the board temp went crazy.<br /><br />We then took the same components and installed them in a Sugo Mini-Cube. Posted and immediately idle temps were under 33® C. So now we could change the noisy 3000 rpm fans for some reasonable 120mm's. The Sugo case only has 2 fans but they can be full width 120's.<br /><br />Bottom line - they tout great German engineering - think they might try some simple German testing before releasing a product.

590719,5,Very good sound at a value price,"I received the LARKSOUND 2.1 Sound Bar with Subwoofer<br /><br />I was happy to receive this sound bar to improve the sound of my 43” TV in the bedroom. (see pic)  The TV sound was OK, this sound bar is much better. To be clear, the sound is not audiophile quality, but not every TV requires audiophile sound and the price that they can cost. This sound bar is a good value.<br /><br />Installation was easy. In my case, the sound bar sits neatly on the shelf below the TV and the subwoofer sits in the corner on the floor.  Assembly of the sound bar is easy, it has two halves that connect by a single wire and then slide together with groves in the housing.  The subwoofer connects via a single wire and RCA-type plug to the sound bar. No additional power is required for the subwoofer.<br /><br />There are multiple input options available: Audio jack, USB-A, Bluetooth, optical and HDMI.  I am using the HDMI ARC output from the TV to the HDMI input on the sound bar.  This allows the sound bar volume to be controlled by the TV remote and the sound bar turns on and off automatically.  I also connected the sound bar to my Amazon Echo via Bluetooth, and can easily switch between TV and Echo using the included  sound bar remote to switch inputs.  Input type is indicated on the sound bar with different color LED, for instance, Bluetooth is blue.  There are different sound options, selectable by remote, including: Standard, Movie, Music, Night, 3D. (see pic)<br /><br />Set up took less than five minutes, simply connect the parts and plug in.  Wall mounting, of course, will take longer to drill holes if required.<br /><br />The package includes the sound bar, the subwoofer, a remote control (see pic), an audio cable, an optical cable, two optional wall standoffs for extra space behind for wiring, mounting hardware and wall template and a user guide. The remote requires two AAA batteries, not included. An HDMI cable is not included.<br /><br />I’m very happy with this sound bar and look forward to watching movies with it.

404548,5,Really nice Bluetooth speaker for my PC,"I don't really like wearing headphones except when I'm on Zoom calls or gaming on Discord with friends. For that reason, I prefer watching videos and listening to music over speakers - but the onboard speakers for most monitors tend to be garbage.<br /><br />Before I bought this sound bar, there were almost no reviews on here, but each one that *was* published was positive. So I took a bit of a chance and purchased this one, since the sound bar I had at the time which was USB-powered + Aux connection only was quickly fizzling out.<br /><br />That was July last year. I've been nothing but impressed by this little sound bar since then! I'm no audiophile, but to me, the sound quality has been consistently good. I've used it while watching Netflix, playing casual games (I don't play shooters or games where the directional audio really matters), and listening to music while I work.<br /><br />Easy to set up and use, with the volume knob right at my fingertips to turn sound up or down. It can get pretty loud; I keep it usually at 20%-30% volume, and turn it up to maybe 60% max. It also fits perfectly under both of my monitors, even the one which is a bit lower. Sometimes (like with any BT speaker) I need to manually reconnect it when I restart my PC, but oftentimes it automatically reconnects.<br /><br />The one ""con"" I'll note is that when it starts up, it lets out this pretty jarring dial tone like a phone trying to call someone, which annoys or startles my partner every time. ** I did see on someone else's review, though, that you can just connect the USB to a power strip to eliminate this ""wake-up"" chime which is caused by turning the soundbar on - by plugging it directly to an outlet, it will always stay on. I've found this isn't true for me: My unit is always plugged into the USB port on a power strip, but connects via Bluetooth, and still sounds every time I turn on my PC. Might work if you connect via aux cable though!<br /><br />For $60, I'm not sure you can get much more value for money with computer speakers/sound bars. It's a 10/10 recommendation from me!",[],B09XV53W67,B0C9PJ9L36,AHW7OLDAXXKQ2M23Q2MZDIOXP4HQ,2023-01-20 07:13:44.198,5,True,491
899083,5,Awesome portable projector,"[[VIDEOID:3932ee658c98b5c592f2afff099087a]] Taking it out of the box, I was surprised by the quality of the case. I love the faux suede material, and I really like that every accessory has its own place. It keeps everything organized and accessible. It also includes everything you need to get going right away.<br /><br />The included power bank is really handy. I have actually used it to charge my other devices when traveling. It will power the projector for a while, but I noticed it seemed to drain quickly. It will easily charge my phone from a very low battery with charge to spare. If you’re planning to watch a movie, I would recommend plugging it directly into an outlet with the included power cable.<br /><br />When I turned it on, my first impression was that it was really bright! Even with lights on in the room, I could still see the screen clearly. I didn’t apply any filters to my video or pictures so you can get a good idea of how the room lighting affects the projection. If you’re in a small and very dark room, there is a setting to dim the brightness. You can adjust the focus with a small dial on the side. It’s really clear, and the picture quality would be better if my walls were flat instead of textured. Connecting the projector to my FireTV with the mini HDMI cable was easy. There is a remote in the carrying case, but the touch-sensitive menu buttons on the projector are also handy in case the remote isn’t nearby or you lose it.<br /><br />The audio is about what you would expect from a small device, but it’s really easy to connect it to a separate Bluetooth speaker. I actually prefer to set a speaker closer to where I am sitting.<br /><br />I have another projector that I can use for fun movie nights outside to project on the side of the house, but it’s big enough that I was always worried about breaking it when we would travel. I don’t have these concerns with this one. I can put everything in the carrying case and toss it in my bag and go. It is also ideal if you’re wanting to project something in a smaller space. Definitely recommend!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Cr8GNe3NL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Cr8GNe3NL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Cr8GNe3NL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fcZdJMMDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fcZdJMMDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fcZdJMMDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rxuXshU2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rxuXshU2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rxuXshU2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xb6BiAlJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xb6BiAlJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xb6BiAlJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KU8YdbOwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KU8YdbOwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KU8YdbOwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BGKMTL1L,B0C3B28D48,AF3K7I2I3WGDX7YPSJPDFURARXRA,2023-01-11 19:23:51.482,3,True,491
556091,5,Niche beats I pad,"There’s really 2 categories of competition when comparing this. 1.  Ipads 2. e ink devices.<br /><br />Vs iPad, the writing feel, eye strain, and battery life (4-5 days), and distractability are the main advantage the boox has over an I pad… essentially every other category from processing power to ux I pad wins…<br /><br />Its more of a paper note pad/ book replacement with lots of enhanced features over a basic notebook. You can look at it all day without eye strain and use it in the dark with its front lit lights. It’s super nice. It really does feel like paper. It can do all android capable features but is not as snappy as you might as expect from an i pad. The user interface is not bad… it’s not great as there’s no apparent tutorial on how to use it within the tablet itself<br /><br />Vs other ink tablets<br />Boox is the most robust in features over the other main competitors. Within the notes app you can input hyper links to websites, and voice recordings, video. It has a back light which I feel is necessary, a camera (which is pretty crappy actually in terms of resolution and focus ability) the fastest writing latency of all competitors at this time, I don’t find myself using the keyboard a ton nor the camera… with the camera theoretically if you take a picture with your phone and sync it with the tablet you can import a photo. The keyboard is very good but when you type, you might type 10 words and they don’t immediately show up, But then they all show up at once after you kind of take a half second break. It doesn’t bother me. It has also never failed to type what I have imputed on the keyboard but something to keep in mind.<br /><br />It was a no brainier to go with boox primarily for the backlight. Between the note air 2 and ultra tab, I liked the idea of the keyboard and especially camera, but the main selling point was the fastest writing speed of the ultra tab.  Looking back I really only use it for hand written notes so I likely could have gotten away with the note Air 2… but then again it’s only about $100 less so not a bad deal",[],B0BDRF66D2,B0BDRF66D2,AE6NVNG5II3JOEKOUDKR3PFHYW7Q,2023-01-09 22:16:06.494,3,False,491
744074,3,Functional alternative to disposable air cans.  Accessories arrived damaged or missing.,"BLUF:  Assuming you receive a truly new unit, this is an okay option at the mid-to-low end of the price range for this type of product.  Forego this specific model and opt for one with a better suite of attachments and suction, which (IMO) is a must-have feature available in similarly sized products<br /><br />**The unit I received appears to missing one attachment and another is cracked (see pictures).**<br /><br />Between environmental impacts and the potential for abuse, I moved away from disposable, compressed air duster cans a long time ago.  Since then I’ve used a combination of detailing attachments on vacuum cleaners, soft bristle brushes, and most recently cleaning gel to get the jobs done.  I don't necessarily need the same force seen with compressed air cans, but it has to be enough to effectively clear debris from the nooks and crannies of my keyboard, computers, consoles, etc.<br /><br />This PGROUP duster performs well enough most of the time.  For scenarios in which it comes up short, one could argue that a different tool would be a better approach.  I don’t think you’ll be disappointed if you choose this product, but better options exist.<br /><br />This offering from pgroup is similar (and some cases effectively identical) to current products from Opwulo, Qindlkar *Amazon’s Choice*, ZLLOO, TriPole, Yomile, KENSOSO, etc.<br /><br />Experience:  The unit powers on with a long press of the single button and operates continuously at the lowest setting.  Short press the button to cycle up to the next speed (three sppeds, low, medium, high).  Turn the unit off with a long press or by cycling past the max speed setting.  The led work light is on whenever the unit is operating and effectively illuminates the work area (if you're too far away for it to help, you're probably too far away for the duster to make a difference).  The accessories snap into place (functionally, not so much audibly) and hold with friction; push or pull to attach or remove respectively. USB-C charging.  More than enough power to get through numerous cleaning sessions.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419IlaEIFSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419IlaEIFSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419IlaEIFSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51kTjTIllpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51kTjTIllpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51kTjTIllpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613NIkbrGKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613NIkbrGKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613NIkbrGKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61h2PMw-48L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61h2PMw-48L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61h2PMw-48L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710l5wH-vXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710l5wH-vXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710l5wH-vXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CdHdfPcyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CdHdfPcyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CdHdfPcyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71npdE3REmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71npdE3REmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71npdE3REmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BM3S5H6K,B0BM3S5H6K,AGZVSMCFKJ4ZBG6RGS5EJCWOCQ7Q,2023-01-09 03:53:00.777,0,False,491
741692,4,Not a 3255 chip but still great.,"We have been using this amp to for dance parties and it's very good, very loud.  I think it's the best under $100 2.1 available right now.<br />I do have two main comments that could be considered negatives.  One, this one does get hot. In our warm environment,  it sometimes shuts down when played loud.  We first put a small 6"" fan on it to cool the case and that works well, but you have to make sure the fan is on also.  We now have drilled holes in the case and it can ventilate and release the heat better.  Fosi should consider passive ventilation or even installing a small fan.<br />The other is the actual chip used.  I believed the publicity that this amp came with TPA3255 chips.  3255 chips accept up to 48 volts though that also depends on the capacitors' rating.  I had planned to get a higher voltage supply and power this at 42-46 volts for the full power of the 3255.<br /><br />BUT this amp is strictly limited to 36 volts which is the power specification for the 3251 chip that is the lower wattage sibling to the 3255.  It is still a very good chip and still more power than the other chips used in these class D amps except the 3255.  To me, the power input ratings and the output specifications all point to the fact that this is a 3251 based amplifier.<br />In addition Fosi does have two other amps (at least) that it advertises as 3255 based amps and those ones are, in fact specified to work with their 46 volt power supply while this one is not.  They also have the power output specifications of a full 3255 amp.<br />Again, nothing wrong with the 3251, it's a very very good amp.  But I do not think wrong for Fosi to pretend that this is one chip when it is almost certainly the lower power version.  I have asked on forums and also here and Fosi will not answer.  The two chips are the same pin configuration so it's possible that Fosi designed the amp to work with either one but then kept the price lower (40+ v power supplies are expensive!)  or the heat production lower.  Please be honest Fosi!  We love your products and want to trust you.",[],B09YNBHR73,B09YNBHR73,AG6CUVMOBT3ZFEKAMYXRFEACHYQA,2023-03-16 18:40:48.121,0,False,491
544147,5,Intel Arc A770 4k@120hz 10bit HDR10,"After having some issues with HDMI and my LG OLED C1, I read that using the displayport is a better way to go. Since TV's don't have displayports I grabbed a DP to HDMI adapter I already had and gave it a try. After a few weeks with no issues I decided to find a better adapter that did 4k@120hz. I received it today(3/2/2023) but so far it seems to be working great.<br /><br />With my LG OLED C1 I can get 4096x2160@120hz 10bit HDR10.<br /><br />One thing I did notice when I tested using 2001: A Space Odyssey 4k remaster was that Plex is telling me I have 5.1 surround Bitrate-2197 kbps. While the TV only seemed to recognize 2 audio channels in the HDMI diagnostics hidden menu. I also confirmed this with Aliens (1986),5.1 24 bit DTS@1509kbps, installed on my pc and using VLC to playback. This could be windows shenanigans since I haven't paid for dolby, but without a proper surround setup I cannot confirm.<br /><br />**Edit: Turns out the surround issue is due to windows NOT the adapter. You can think Microsoft for its extremely poor implementation of audio, although without testing I can't say that Linux does it any better. Also while playing around I did notice some audio skipping, I couldn't figure out what was causing the issue since it was intermittent. Then I remembered another review that mentioned the adapter getting hot, so I slapped a few raspberry pi heatsinks I had on the adapter. The skipping issue went away almost immediately. I also checked the firmware and found it to be up to date, the utility Cable Matters has on their website made checking/updating the firmware very easy. I still give this adapter 5 stars since it does everything its advertised to do, although it could do a better job of cooling.<br /><br />Edit 03/20/2023: I'm now using this with the cable matters Active 8k HDMI Fiber Optic Cable 300047-BLK-15M. The adapter and cable are still getting 4k@120hz VRR 10bit HDR, but now with a 15m/49ft cable.

684639,4,A good secondary monitor with minor problems,"Overall, I'm pretty happy with this monitor. I use it as a secondary monitor on my large desktop PC (I have an ultrawide as my primary). This sits conveniently next to the larger screen. Setting it up was as simple as plugging it in and extending my desktop in Windows.<br /><br />I do wish the brightness was a little better. Sometimes it feels dim and could use better contrast (I have both set to max and it still needs more). I haven't tested the built-in speakers yet, but in my configuration I have little need of them.<br /><br />Here's the odd thing... there's no power button. It seems to rely on your PCs power settings or on the fact you're going to shut the PC down. I virtually never shut down my desktop. There's simply no need unless I have to do a brief reboot. I just turn my primary monitor off physically before I go to bed. But, I can't do that with this monitor. I have to physically unplug it. Minor inconvenience. It comes right back when I plug it back in.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great convenience to have this screen sitting off on the side when I'm playing a game on the big screen. It's nice to just be able to mouse over and read a document without having to alt-tab out (which many games aren't too happy about).<br /><br />There's no real mounting solution for this monitor. I believe the expectation is that you're going to just use the magnetic case that came with it and stand it up like you would a tablet. I suspect that works for most applications, just don't expect to be able to stick this on a VESA mount or anything like that.<br /><br />I received this for free through the Vine Voice program, but I can tell you I wouldn't pay the asking price for it ($189 as of this writing). It feels too expensive for what you actually get. There are similar products on the market right here on Amazon that also have IPS panels and are $60-70 cheaper.<br /><br />I know that sounded like a lot of complaining, so I want to emphasize that I still believe this is a solid 4-star product. I wish they would reduce the price a bit, but I can definitely recommend this for certain configurations.",[],B0BQ3659KB,B0BYYMRRJC,AGWZUZ2BHKVFNBJFFMHEOTICWPVA,2023-02-22 19:02:52.973,0,False,491
687786,3,Occer Compact Binoculars,"I purchased these compact Occer binoculars on Amazon a while back. These particular binoculars have been the top selling binocular on Amazon for a very long period of time. That fact alone got me interested in buying them. I have a very large collection of binoculars at home. I live in the California high desert in a beautiful scenic valley with spectacular views. This dark sky area I live in is also ideal for astronomy.<br />These come with a very nice carry case and the two rubber eye cups that come with the binoculars are attached to each other, which is a good idea, less likelihood of them getting lost. These come with a thin economy style neck strap. These binoculars have these rotating eye cups that extend outwards as you twist them. I've never seen this feature before on binoculars, I think it's mainly for eyeglass wearers. The eye cups can be extended out for quite a distance from the binoculars body.<br />My first impression of these Occer binoculars is extreme disappointment with the magnification. The Chinese manufacturing companys love to exaggerate magnification claims on these economy binocular models. I'd say the true magnification on my binoculars is only about 7 1/2 power, nowhere near the stated 12 power placed in the Amazon ad. I make this claim judging from the magnification that my other binoculars provide. I bought another new pair of compact binoculars around the same time I bought these Occers. This other set was around the same price and are a bit smaller in size than the Occer brand. I prefer this other brand over the Occers set because of the increased magnification they provide. Sadly this model was discontinued right after I bought them.<br />The Chinese are so advanced now in binocular manufacturing that it's hard to go wrong buying an inexpensive set of binoculars with BAK4 prisms. All these BAK4 binoculars sold on Amazon provide excellent image clarity and detail. The image quality from one brand to another is negligible due to the high quality standards the Chinese now have in their manufacturing process. All these different binocular brands with BAK4 prisms provide excellent image quality that was not available on cheap binoculars many years ago. Now if they could only be a bit more honest on the true stated magnification in their ads, then they would hit a home run!",[],B0756BXDTX,B0BQRNFHCV,AFDT36FWMJUKC5XA57MLBD6ZRWWQ,2023-02-26 17:36:48.730,42,True,491
494182,4,Great for keeping an eye on package deliveries and pickups,"I send out a lot of packages each week and usually I will schedule a pick up. This means that I will usually place my packages on the front porch so that they can be picked up during the day. Similarly, there are times when I receive a package, but have no idea it’s arrived for hours because the package delivery notification doesn’t update. So, I’ve always been worried about leaving packages for pick up or from delivery to me out on the porch for too long for fear that someone might take something. So, I was excited to get this wireless camera to be able to keep tabs on the front porch area.<br /><br />This was very easy to install on the house and similarly it was easy to set up on the app. There are a bunch of customizable options on the app about how sensitive you want the motion sensor to be, notification options, etc. The motion sensor is very very sensitive!! I had to put it all the way down to the lowest sensitivity because I was getting motion notifications several times an hour in the beginning. As it is, I still get notifications whenever my neighbor’s car leaves the driveway or at nighttime when car lights pass by. However, I easily fixed this by positioning the camera a little differently so that I could customize the location of the sensor.<br /><br />When I get a notification of motion, now I can go into the app and take a look at the picture that was snapped to see what the motion was. Very helpful in determining if there is an issue outside and in ensuring the safety of my packages. However, I do wish the picture would be taken faster. Sometimes I’m getting the tail end of someone leaving the front door. I can set up the app to allow for video storage but I haven’t done so.<br /><br />One thing I really don’t like is that there is a bright light that will go on during motion sensing - it seems to only go on when it’s a certain level of darkness. I have not found a way to deactivate this but would love to. I assume it gets very annoying to my neighbors at night, and probably also disorienting to anyone coming up to the door.<br /><br />Overall though, this is a great camera that provides exactly what I needed to keep tabs on the front porch area.",[],B0BHNLXZPP,B0BHNLXZPP,AGMUMHQLUEVQFIR7SAUSH5MN37UQ,2023-01-04 22:13:04.509,0,False,491
901669,1,"Xtrasaver Inc. is Selling These with Ancient Inputs --> D-Sub, DVI, only one HDMI","Xtrasaver Inc. sent me a refurbished/""renewed"" one of these - price was right...<br /><br />What arrived looked new! Only, it had the wrong base, square instead of curved. Only, it had only one HDMI input (standard female), instead of 2. Only, it had a DVI input, and a D-Sub input.<br /><br />Only, it didn't come with a Display Port input. None.<br /><br />So, what if someone wanted to take advantage of the two HDMI inputs from two sources, and share them on the one screen - which is a feature for this monitor?<br /><br />Easy, just time travel to when Fry's still existed everywhere, to when they carried connectors and cables of all types and many eras of electronics, and get yourself a D-Sub cable. Or, perhaps you're still running video cards with DVI connectors?<br /><br />Then maybe you can use the dual input feature, maybe?<br /><br />Otherwise, it ain't gonna happen. Because, Fry's is gone and Methuselah moved on from D-Sub decades ago.<br /><br />So, I'm returning this. Am taking pictures, while at UPS so I have a witness, of the monitor and the accessories. Am also taking pictures using the packaging used to deliver it to me. So, if Xtrasaver tries to claim they got it with things missing and or damaged, from me or my packaging job, I got my evidence to counter.<br /><br />Amazon has already stepped in on this and we're both waiting for them to get the return, and promptly refund me.<br /><br />There's new one's available, with the correct inputs and features, for like 30 bucks more. I went for it. It ships from Amazon. Am confident all will be well with the new one. Am not so confident Xtrasaver will refund me without a hassle, but Amazon said they will be contacting them, to help make sure I get my money back...<br /><br />D-Sub inputs... who here misses VGA graphics?

834578,1,Shipped unprotected .. 2 legs indented .. did not fit my light .. no instructions.,"When I ordered this had a list price of $39.99 with $5 off (for a final cost of $34.99).<br /><br />You’d think if the manufacturer had any pride they’d put some packing around this but they just put it into a plastic bag & stuck that into a thin cardboard box, & that’s how it shipped.<br /><br />Once opened, some parts were rattling loose in the box, and there were no instructions or anything else to reach out or know what parts should be included — the box was not fully sealed by the time it got to me.<br /><br />I pulled it out, & found where the parts fit, then upon extending the tubes noticed where there was a big indent on one of the tubular legs.<br /><br />It still opened & did not seem to make it any more wobble or unsteady. Then I looked at the other two legs & another was less obviously indented — so 2 of 3 tube-legs were crushed in, I can suppose during shipping, but there were no obvious paint flecks — so possibly it was sent out that way?<br /><br />I later tried to mount my streaming light, but the “dual” fitting on this tripod had “dual” male ends, unfortunately just like the tripod fitting on my light is male — so I can’t even use this without going somewhere else to find an adapter that fits the tripod mount to the light attachment.<br /><br />This is lousy performance of this manufacturer to ship its product with no protection to speak of & not include any help or other info inside with the product. Not taking the obvious step of packing it to protect it is just tempting fate and the resulting suffering of the consumer who is then expected to re-pack, ship it back, order another.<br /><br />Disappointed customer on this end.<br /><br />I’d look for another tripod..<br />..from a manufacturer that tries to protect his product;<br />..tries to put sufficient adapters in to fit typical devices you’d expect it to attach to;<br />..and has the minimal sense of duty to put written materials in the box so you can know if everything is there (at least).","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZVjEkRvML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZVjEkRvML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZVjEkRvML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cMhXhyCuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cMhXhyCuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cMhXhyCuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wSfYaBC7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wSfYaBC7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wSfYaBC7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BGHRKFK1,B0BGHRKFK1,AGOJATIYVQVYV2TCAJHF3B4BLCAQ,2023-01-18 20:21:33.091,0,False,491
176901,3,Disappointing,"I have so many Samsung devices, that when my fourth fitness tracker from another company died I decided to give Samsung a try. Here are the pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />==============<br />-The Samsung name.<br /><br />-It has many more features that I will every use.<br /><br />-The design feels sturdy and I expect it to be durable.<br /><br />-It is attractive enough for a smart watch.<br /><br />Cons:<br />==============<br />-The battery life sucks. Even in battery saving mode, the watch gives you a maximum of a day and a half of charge. Mind you, I don't really do anything other than look at the clock, my heart rate, and steps. I do not answer the phone with it, or send messages, etc. My old fitness tracker, which granted had fewer features, would last upward of a week doing the same thing.<br /><br />-Sleep tracking is a joke, because again the battery sucks.<br /><br />-You cannot remove unused apps from the watch. Electronics manufactures love to load smart watches, phones, PCs with stuff you don't need and will never use. Considering these things often work in the background and use energy, it would make sense to be able to remove them.<br /><br />-It is incredibly thick.<br /><br />-There is no way to know by the packaging whether you are getting a US or international version. Found that out the hard way with the first one of these I bought. Try registering an international version in the US and you will see why this is an issue... though I would argue there should only be one global version for something like this anyway. There is no reason why the end-user could not just install the region specific software they need.<br /><br />-The US version has a shorter warranty (1 year) than if you live in the EU (2 years). Hey, either your device will last two years or it won't. Give us the same guarantee you give others. Given the issues I have had with Samsung products over the years; washers that throw baskets through walls, Note phablets that catch fire, and a monitor that started black screening about a month after the warranty expired...

5839,2,"OK hub, very limited I/O offering","I've used one of these side-mounted hubs on my Macbook Pro ever since they released the dual TB3 model. However, when I moved to the new M1 Macbook Pro, the old hubs covered my Magsafe charge port, making them much less useful.<br /><br />This is the first hub I've used that gets around the Magsafe port with a cutout, in order to offer the same side-mount functionality. It passes through one USB4 port and uses the second to provide HDMI, ethernet, and USB-C -> USB-A conversion.<br /><br />However: the overall experience is quite limited - it allows for 4k@60Hz HDMI, a single USB2.0 port, and a 1GbE link. That's 18Gbps+0.480Gbps+1Gbps, respectively, or ~20Gbps bandwidth usage while consuming a 40Gbps port. While it's expected that this hub runs at the USB 3.2 Gen2x2 20Gbps spec, the consumption on this hub is not appropriately maximizing the IO. 2/4 USB-C data pairs can be utilized to send a 4k@60Hz signal, offering the necessary 20Gbps of bandwidth via Alt Mode. That means 10Gbps of bandwidth is still available from the USB-C port, and it is allocated here for a USB2.0 port and an ethernet link. The USB2.0 port is connected directly to the USB-C dedicated USB2.0 pins, so the only thing connected to the 10Gbps link is a USB3->Ethernet adapter chip (the AX88179A).<br /><br />All of that is to say: this is really *not* a ""hub"". There is no USB hub chip inside. It's simply taking one USB-C port and dividing its lanes into an ethernet chip, a HDMI, and a USB2.0 port with no hub controller. This means the overall bandwidth is very limited, and the functionality of the ""hub"" itself is minimal. For the price, I'd expect an integrated hub chip that exposes, at bare minimum, an additional USB3.0 port instead of a USB2.0 port. Instead, a 10Gbps USB3.2 lane is entirely being dedicated to a single, 1Gbps ethernet link.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41N+qfZuTSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41N+qfZuTSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41N+qfZuTSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41f2ikn21RL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41f2ikn21RL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41f2ikn21RL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mljw7LrEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mljw7LrEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mljw7LrEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BMTFC9D6,B0BT9TJF2C,AGAAXD7WO2UNJTOROMSTILXLI24Q,2023-01-05 00:49:29.387,0,False,491
178029,5,"Really nice folio slip case, but a tight fit even for an Air","I have a lovely new MacBook Air and am not ready to hide it with a hard shell. But, in most briefcases or packs, without protection, it kind of slides around in the slot. Plus, it's really hard to get a good grip on it when taking it in and out of a bag. What I wanted was a slip case, one not too padded, because my briefcase has a padded slot, bu something protective w/out a lot of bulk. This is perfection.<br /><br />These folks sent this product in one of the most impressive packaging I've seen. The folio even comes with its own drawstring pouch (which you can use to store it, cover it, or use alone for you Air). If the folio stands up as impressively as the first impression, they've made a customer for life.<br /><br />It's zippered on 2 sides only and my Air slid in and was a nice tight fit. It's got a very nice feel to it without creating bulk. It also provides better gripping when moving the Air from case to desk. The felt inside is smooth and tight. Won't pill or shed. This is not a heavy duty padded slip case. It's a folio, meant for something you slip into something else. When you zip it up, it's a nice snug fit. It easily slipped into my briefcase slot and kept it from moving around.<br /><br />Honestly don't know what I'd use the slots inside for. Things would need to be slim and not capable of denting the Air. But, it's a plus that they're there in case a need ever comes up.<br /><br />WARNING!<br />If you have a MacBook Pro, get the next size up. My Air...without a shell or casing, was a snug fit. A Pro might be really tight in the 14 inch version. I have a shell for my Air that hasn't been installed yet and just putting the shell in this was a real stretch.<br /><br />This folio is classy. Smart, practical, and having this makes me question even putting a shell on my Air..  My iPaid Air, with protective case fits in this, making it a safer way to tuck it into backpacks and briefcases.  I'm actually keeping the box it came in, too.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21CJj2BjpoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21CJj2BjpoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21CJj2BjpoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21DuFzvYYcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21DuFzvYYcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21DuFzvYYcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21Ogt3mAlKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21Ogt3mAlKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21Ogt3mAlKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21dNy3uC7YL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21dNy3uC7YL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21dNy3uC7YL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21kWFmq1cNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21kWFmq1cNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21kWFmq1cNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31i4HEBUUQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31i4HEBUUQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31i4HEBUUQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41jF2h0ND5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41jF2h0ND5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41jF2h0ND5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BDDBNZTL,B0BKH7VTX1,AERVBDCJE3FQCZSVV3KIHAY3VCNQ,2023-01-13 20:48:55.168,0,False,491

395582,5,Whole lot of space with a pretty good microphone.,"5 stars are usually reserved for products that go above and beyond or just do just one thing to me that makes them more then what I thought I needed out of the product. I knew I needed a voice recorder to make a journal. Didn't expect having a voice recorder with just having an idle shut off. Yes, the idle shut off is what's getting the five stars here.<br /><br />I won't lie that I'm a very forgetful person. So I do forget I leave devices on and go out the next day to realize I have electronics ready to shut off. The idle shut off is just a nice feature for people like me. It's been 3 weeks since I gotten the device and so far it never needed a recharge thanks to this feature. So if you do finish recording, hit save and forget to turn it off or it turns on in your pocket it'll shut back off after a while.<br /><br />Now, other then just one good feature the microphone is surprisingly good. It does catch a lot so if using in lessons it should pick up your instructor even at the middle of the class depending on the room. I also do like that it comes with a 48 gig card. With just voice data that will take a long time to fill up and honestly since it's just a microsd card holding all the data you can just buy a bigger card if you so happen to get this one full. The card even comes out easily.<br /><br />As for playback, this device is actually decent if not a bit loud. You'll hear every bit of what you were trying to record and of course the background noise.<br /><br />For the negatives. There will be white noise in your background but if you're going for a voice recorder at this price I feel it's sort of expected. This also can be remedied a bit with even free audio software and a few minutes of your time if you're willing to edit. In short, if you want 100% clear audio with none of that static noise in the background, this may not be for you. If you just need something to note things down, or use for lectures then this is fine.<br /><br />In short, for 30 dollars this is a great voice recorder.

994018,2,Oh BlueParrott,"I've used the BlueParrott B260-xt & xts since 2009 or so. I'm a trucker and I fell in love with the B250 because it was the 1st headset I wore where I could very clearly hear all phone calls as if I were on a landline phone. No matter how loud the truck was (for those who know, think PTO on and on high or check the engine with the RPMs high) I could hear the person on the other end with no problems and vice versa.<br /><br />Now enter the B450-xt....<br />The earpiece is amazing, you can wear it all day long with no problems. The problem is that it's entirely too quiet. If you have the volume maxed out, the loudest your environment can be is that of the inside of a passenger car with the windows up, air on low,  radio off, driving 50MPH. Anything more than that and you'll struggle to hear the person in the other end. Add to this, the fact that your mic volume is also low, so they'll struggle to hear you at times even when their sitting in a quiet house.<br /><br />For truckers or anyone who works in loud environments, I cannot ever recommend this headset. Maybe it has something to do with Jabra buying out Vxi BlueParrott, I can't answer that, but Jabra has never been trucker friendly.<br /><br />I will give the B450 credit where it is due....<br />The earpiece sits over the ear and is extremely comfortable.<br />The cushioning on the head strap is very comfortable as well.<br />The battery life is beyond amazing. Charged it to full and after almost a week it's still over 50%. I use my headset to talk about 5 hours per day, 5 days a week.<br /><br />The bad....<br />The mic volume is too quiet and people can't hear you as well as other headsets.<br />The speaker volume is way too quiet to use in noisy settings.<br />The mic boom is rather short and only reaches the outside corner of your mouth.

They were almost fully charged upon receipt and I haven't let the case go below 80% before charging it again.<br />The case is small and compact - not bulky in any way. I carry a medium/large sized bag at any given time and it would get lost inside it!<br />The sound quality is crazy for it being the price that they are. I'm pleasantly surprised with that. No static, very clear. I use them on phone calls/zoom from time to time and haven't heard any complaints which is weird because with my JBL headphones I get feedback from people that they can't hear me or it sounds very low on my end. Weird!<br />I do have two gripes with these earphones.<br />First, while it's not a huge issue, it's kind of annoying. How the earbuds are placed in the case is just odd to me. I'm used to most earbuds being placed with the long portion (where the connectors are that enables it to charge inside the case) inserting into the outermost part of the case with the part that goes into your ear toward the middle part of the case. Oftentimes I find myself inserting the earbuds in the wrong way once I'm done with them when they do NOT go into the case that way!<br />Second issue is that the sensors that allow you to change songs/end calls/answer calls/pause music just SUCKS. I hate to say it like that, however, it's true.

144410,5,Worked great to cool M2 NVMe enclosure,"Pros:<br />• Worked perfectly for cooling an M.2 NVMe drive enclosure<br />• Thermal tape adheres well and appears to have good thermal transfer<br /><br />Cons:<br />• Fins could be a bit thicker, and not have slits to increase surface area<br /><br />I am using this heatsink on the surface of an ACASIS TBU401E Thunderbolt M.2 NVMe external drive enclosure.  This enclosure has a SK Hynix P41 NVMe SSD in it that gets quite warm.  The ACASIS drive enclosure is generally excellent other than its thermal performance. It was getting rather hot with the high performance P41 SSD and was concerned with thermal throttling and degraded lifetime of the drive.<br /><br />This heatsink has lowered the temperature considerably.  I should have taken before and after temperatures, but I didn’t. It does feel considerably cooler now though. The heatsink is warm and so is the rest of the drive.  This indicates the heatsink is doing exactly what was hoped for; it is efficiently removing heat.  The thermal tape is working well transferring heat from the bottom cover to the heat sink, and physically retaining the heatsink as well.<br /><br />The ACASIS drive enclosure has a thermal pad between the M.2 SSD and the bottom cover. This transfers heat from the drive to this cover modestly well, but that cover isn’t large and there is relatively poor thermal transfer from the cover to the rest of the enclosure housing.  The result is that only the cover serves to remove heat from the drive.  Adding this heat sink to the cover substantially increases the thermal mass and surface area.<br /><br />The size of the heatsink matches the size of the SSD reasonably well, and fits easily and neatly on the cover of the enclosure.  Overall, it is a good fit.  I could have used a few more millimeters on each side and height, but this works well and looks relatively neat.  This may reduce the portability of the drive, but for my application it is being used in a fixed location so not an issue.<br /><br />This works very well with this M.2 drive enclosure, and will likely work well for other similar external M.2 NVMe external drive enclosures.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xk43YRNOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xk43YRNOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xk43YRNOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0948TKWLS,B0948TKWLS,AE7DZ3XTVG6DTUFU2KBE52MDPL4A,2023-03-11 18:48:43.451,0,True,491
914364,5,Awesome Thunderbolt Hub with a huge power supply,"Wow, thats a big power supply! But it does provide 60Watts of charging to your connected laptop.<br />I have been looking for a Thunderbolt hub for quite some time since I have added a TB card to my tower.<br />I was pretty concerned at first with this device as it provides 60 Watts of charging power to your connected laptop, Yet my TB card provides 90 Watts of power to connected devices. My concern was with both components pushing power towards each other, is something going to ""spark"", well short circuit. After a few emails with the seller, they confirmed  I would be fine. Still being wary, I connected first to another system to make sure nothing would happen. Everything worked on all systems tested as speeds were not impacted by adding this hub. I was able to achieve 20-28Gb/s out of the 40b/s theoretical max speed. Not to bad, actually very great. The max I was able o achieve was 2972 MB/s which is screaming fast and about the max speed on the external NVME drive I had attached. When testing speeds this fast, your bottlenecks become the speeds of cables, physical hardware, NVME drive, external enclosure. Any one component can reduce your overall speed at Thunderbolt 40Gb/s. Hooking up 2 external NVME drives to 2 separate ports on this hub and doing my file test consisting of 25 gigs of data I was able to achieve the following: Copying to both external drives at the same time about 700-800 MBytes/s. Copying from both drives at the same time to my computer . up to 1800MB/s for one drive, and around 1200MB/s from both drives. So there was a little drop, but you have both drives dumping a total of 75 gig onto my one internal drive which can only write so fast. The copying from one external to the other external resulted in a max of 500MB/s with a low of around 200MB/s. So performance was slower transferring port to port on the hub. I would have liked to seen a bit better port to port speed but there could be multiple reasons for that. Only thing they could have changed would be to switch the locations of the power cord and On/Off Button, and maybe some holes in the bottom for mounting, Overall this is a great Thunderbolt Hub and works perfectly for my needs and performs very very good","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6126idk40VL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6126idk40VL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6126idk40VL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KT2Gx1n-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KT2Gx1n-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KT2Gx1n-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tFbg0GMNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tFbg0GMNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tFbg0GMNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7114lyx6w-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7114lyx6w-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7114lyx6w-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715tT82LwBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715tT82LwBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715tT82LwBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71v5BuZgeCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71v5BuZgeCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71v5BuZgeCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B458QQDM,B0B458QQDM,AHVWYDCMZ5XHJ7K45FIKQ5HZ2FRA,2023-02-09 23:06:06.339,0,False,491
131102,1,Inaccurate on multiple functions; terrible battery life,"Okay, I gave this three weeks to win me over.  Not impressed.  I’ll give a rundown by function:<br /><br />The step counter is terribly inaccurate.  Usually it overestimates (by a lot), but at least once it underestimated.  In my pictures, the pedometer I’m comparing it to is one I know is accurate, that I wear on my ankle at all times.<br /><br />Blood pressure measurements are way off, and not in a consistent or predictable way.<br /><br />It does receive text messages, but doesn’t make use of its huge screen to display them.  The font is tiny—smaller than the font I have on a watch with a much smaller screen.<br /><br />The battery barely lasts 2 days.  3 if you’re lucky.  The first time it actually lasted only 1 day, until I changed some settings (made it dimmer, told it not to check my heart rate as frequently, told it to leave the screen on for shorter lengths of time).  It doesn’t give you any warning that the battery is low, but turns off vibration mode, so any alarms you have set won’t do you any good.  Then—unless you frequently check the battery specifically—one time you’ll look down and not be able to get the screen to turn on.<br /><br />The charger itself is nice.  It has a strong magnet, so it attaches easily and doesn’t get knocked loose.<br /><br />The sleep tracker doesn’t match what other watches get, though I can’t be sure which one is right (as far as deep sleep goes).  This watch always gave smaller amounts of deep sleep.<br /><br />Scrolling is difficult enough to make the preset timers pretty useless, unless you only need one of them.  Also, the lowest time it has is 20 minutes.  I often need 5 minutes, or 1 minute.<br /><br />Its shape, size, and the location of the buttons make it uncomfortable to wear, as the buttons dig into the back of your hand.  It’s a little more comfortable if you wear it on your right wrist.  Since most people wear watches on their left, this is a poor design.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61B2DFtRuoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61B2DFtRuoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61B2DFtRuoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ECKTKT3JL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ECKTKT3JL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ECKTKT3JL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HStUsQ05L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HStUsQ05L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HStUsQ05L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Hy1789lWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Hy1789lWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Hy1789lWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PCwSWn7bL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PCwSWn7bL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PCwSWn7bL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nwewuZFxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nwewuZFxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nwewuZFxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713XZSiKrmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713XZSiKrmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713XZSiKrmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B5SZ5YKP,B0B5SZ5YKP,AGIJKXQIDMWK3T3MNR26SZBAYWYQ,2023-02-04 20:00:59.591,0,False,491
839778,4,Works great on the 2023 Subaru Crosstrek,"We had been using a standard USB-A cable to connect our iPhone to the vehicle so we could use Apple Car Play. It was a pain to deal with the excess cable. Also, when it was connected via USB-A, Apply Car play would often disconnect when we drove on bumpy roads. I think this was due to the weight of the excess cord and using the phone, each pulling on the cable while it was connected to the car.  Could we use a shorter cord? Absolutely, but we didn't want to deal with multiple cords. Since switching over to wireless and using this wireless adapter, we have had no issues with Apple Car Play disconnecting.<br /><br />We read review after review and were worried about the quality. We decided to try this CarPlay Wireless<br />Adapter and we have to say we have had great results with it. We use it with an iPhone 14 connected to a 2023 Subaru Crosstrek.<br /><br />We use it mostly for the Apple Car play navigation feature. We primarily use Waze and Google Maps as our navigation apps. Both work exceptionally well. We also listen to podcasts and music. Both work great. We have not noticed any issue with a longer-than-expected wait period between songs. The fact that it is wireless also took care of our issue with what to do with the excess cable.<br /><br />If we were to pick one negative comment about this adapter we wish it was a plug-it-in and forget-about-it type product. Our family has both Apple and Android users. You cannot leave this wireless adapter plugged into the car if you wish to connect an Android phone to the car at the same time. This adapter overrides any Android connection function. When we want to connect the Android phone to the car we need to unplug this adapter. Once the adapter is disconnected only then are we able to connect the Android phone to the car. You can leave it connected if you wish to connect different iPhones. It's a minor inconvenience but nothing that would change our minds about our purchase.<br /><br />We have only had this for a short time so we gave a rating of four (4) since we have no idea if this adapter will last or not.  However, if it performs as well as it has been we would not hesitate to give it a rating of five (5).",[],B0BBG4QRPX,B0C999QJR6,AEBV5SWSS6COKMAHF67HFTHWWTHA,2023-02-21 22:19:52.301,14,True,491
453129,4,Decent enough mp3 player,"This little device delivers in some ways, but is lacking a bit in others.  It is small and lightweight, thought it seems to be pretty sturdy and not too flimsy, so I’m hoping it will last a while. The instructions included are kind of minimal, so you need to have a basic knowledge of how to upload music from a computer. I simply slapped some mp3 files into the folder, so it was definitely easy enough. At first I didn’t think they came with headphones, but they were in the bottom of the box so I’m glad I checked. They are earbud style headphones that actually fit pretty good in my son’s ears. The sound isn’t exactly high quality, but for what you’re paying for, it’s decent enough. My son knows he’s not allowed to listen to this above a  volume 10 as it does get quite loud, but I told him I prefer he keeps it at an 8. He uses this mainly for his workouts. He likes to run on the elliptical and usually uses his tablet for music. He is too young for a phone, so this was a great alternative for him.<br />The player comes with other options such as audio recording, which can be handy, or photos. Honestly, most of the menu seems quite pointless to me. And when you click between menus, what you think you should be pressing by intuition ends up being the wrong thing, so I find myself backing out of to the menu by accident quite often. This is probably the only real frustrating thing.<br />For what it is, it works just fine at this time. It is definitely not what you’d expect from a high end mp3 player, but I think it is great for kids or just someone looking for a cheap music player. Oh and be aware, it doesn’t play on any internal speaker or through Bluetooth, so you have to use an output source connected through the auxiliary jack. The radio also works surprisingly well and it’s nice to be able to preset my son’s favorite stations. I will also say, the device came fully charged and he’s been wearing them almost daily for a week and it still shows as full. I didn’t have high hopes for this mp3 player, but I am more than pleasantly surprised.",[],B0BDKG742T,B0BDKG742T,AEZNOU7HR7T33FD3MJODDE2R23UQ,2023-01-03 02:30:42.108,1,False,491
759010,4,It should be called a balance maintainer and only used on previously-balanced packs.,"So if you have a string of eight cells and you're buying a balancer, the expectation is every cell in the pack will be at a very similar voltage than the rest of the cells in the pack.  That's not what this does.  In fact, the first cell relative to the second cell could be 0.1 volts lower and the second cell relative to the third cell could be 0.1v lower and so on all the way to the last cell.  A pack that reads 2.79,2.88,2.97,3.06,3.15,3.24,3.33,3.42 won't trigger this balancer to even turn on!  This balancer would work okay on a well-balanced pack to maintain it, but it absolutely will not balance a very out of balance pack.  I will be returning it.<br /><br />Update: after extensive experimentation and reading the data sheet for the IC that controls the voltage threshold for starting and stopping balancing, it became clear to me that this IC was developed and optimized for lithium ion, not lithium iron phosphate.  As such, the triggering mechanism works better at slightly elevated voltages.  Setting my BMS to terminate charge when the first cell hits 3.8 volts did two things.  1. It caused larger voltage differentials in my 8s pack.  2. It caused the IC in this balancer to trigger reliably at the end of charge and start balancing.  The result is much more aggressive balancing and better performance overall.  So, if you want this to work, try slightly overcharging your lithium iron phosphate cells to 3.8v for aggressive balancing then set your cell cut off back down to 3.60 volts after the pack is balanced for longevity.<br /><br />I don't see this as a terrible thing, considering the absolute Max voltage on lithium iron phosphate is 4.2 volts and the cell only stays at 3.8 volts for perhaps one to two minutes at the end of charge.<br /><br />I am adjusting my rating and considering keeping this.  The chip manufacturer should consider altering the detection algorithm and threshold so it works better for lithium iron phosphate at the lower cell voltages.  Also worth mentioning, this chip supports two amps.  I don't know why they didn't enable it.  Perhaps heat dissipation or reliability.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618T31aLGaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618T31aLGaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618T31aLGaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71A4kwoqjdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71A4kwoqjdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71A4kwoqjdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09MSDLD2Q,B09MSDHPNN,AHDW4R62FBRN3EGEVT3DVK6JVTQQ,2023-02-26 00:47:56.820,1,True,491
902869,5,"Solid, High Speed Splitter with Power Adapter!","FIDECO 7-Port USB Hub, USB 3.2 Gen 1 Data Hub with Independent On/Off Switch<br /><br />First I am going to start off and say, this is my favorite USB splitter to date! The product comes in a sturdy, weighted aluminum case. This weight allows it to sit neatly on your desk without flipping over if you bump a cable. The only thing that could make this case better is a rubber grip on the bottom to prevent it from sliding. The bottom surface is smooth, so it can easily slide with a finger push.<br /><br />One great feature about this product is it comes with its own power adapter. I have gotten splitters that have a jack to connect to a power adapter, but they never actually came with one. I am very happy this is included in the package.<br /><br />This was very easy to connect to my computer. I plugged it into the USB-C port on the front of my desktop and it was ready to go right away.<br /><br />To test its functionality, I plugged in 6 USB thumb-drives and a set of desktop speakers. Like expected, each of the drives showed up on my computer and were fully functional. On top of the thumb drives being plugged in, I was playing music with the speakers. This handy device is also providing the power for them.<br /><br />I really like the individual on/off buttons for each USB slot. Because I like to use these to power my speakers, I use the push button to turn off the speakers. That way the volume level is always set on my speakers and I just turn the power off to it.<br /><br />One thing I have to note that you as the consumer MUST know about. I plugged the power adapter into the splitter, and then plugged my speakers into one of the ports. The speaker immediately responded by playing a buzzing sound. I then connected the USB-C cable to my computer and the buzzing almost went away and you can only hear it when there is nothing playing. To me, this indicates that there is possibly noise on the internal buck converter or maybe some grounding issues. I do not believe this will have an effect on your devices, but it does affect speakers when they are plugged into this product.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this product and recommend it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714dTtFvIPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714dTtFvIPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714dTtFvIPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B5RDR4ZM,B0C2PCKXTS,AHFGPIGYA5FZBKLZEWKCUJDPNQVQ,2023-02-17 03:15:22.664,1,False,491
229638,4,Complete background kit at a reasonable price.,"This is a nice background stand kit that comes complete with two stands, a sectional crossbar, 6-spring clips, two sandbags and a convenient carry case that can hold everything except the sandbags when they're filled with sand.<br /><br />The medium-duty stands work fine for holding up a background and you can raise them as high as a little over 7'.<br /><br />Because the cross bar contains individual sections, it can be configured to three different widths: 5', 7½', and 10' which is nice because sometimes when you go on location, there isn't room to set up a 10' wide background, especially when all you need is 7' or less for your backdrop.<br /><br />The sandbags have a wide opening on the top which is very convenient for filling with sand, or water bottles, or rocks, etc.<br /><br />Here's a sandbag tip if you want to fill them permanently with sand as opposed to filling them with rocks or water bottles when you get to your photo destination<br /><br />Start by getting two Ziplock 1-gallon freezer bags and fill the bags up with as much sand as they will hold and still let you zipper them closed.  You can then put the Ziplok bags into the sandbags and pull the drawstring closed.  It makes for a much cleaner sandbag that is essentially double walled now and there is no chance of the sand ever leaking out of the bag through the seams or out of the top which doesn't close completely with that drawstring.<br /><br />The sandbags are shown suspended from the lower sections of the light stands where the leg tightening knob is.  To get them to work as shown, you will need to forcibly open the large metal O ring wide enough to get it around the lower pole section. Then you will have to bend it back perfectly into its original position - tight against the other side.<br /><br />It takes quite a bit of fussing to get the two sections to mate up perfectly again but it's worth the time because you're going leave these rings on the stand permanently. Once you get the two sections to mate tightly together, secure the sections together with some gaffer tape.  That is because the weight of the sandbags will have a tendency to separate the rings where the split is.",[],B0BYMKDZ3K,B0C3XLDTPY,AHC5VRYWOIUH5VPCUA5CJREX5DKA,2023-04-27 04:48:43.155,0,False,491

209216,5,"An Extremely Durable, High Quality DisplayPort Cable","This is a shockingly durable, rigid, high quality DisplayPort cable that will work great for whatever your needs may be. The cable is an adequately acceptable length that is able to easily reach from my wall mounted monitor all the way down to my Gaming PC that is sitting in a roller cart on the floor. The cable comes packaged using two velcro strap style cable organizers that you can remove and then use to organize the cables from your PC or elsewhere. The outer sleeve of the cable is a very durable, braided nylon that isn't loose at all and fits very snug against the cable itself. I tried scratching it and it was not able to tear up the nylon fibers which is good enough to me on that end. As far as the connectors go, it is a locking style DisplayPort cable, so if you prefer the ones that don't lock, then it may not be for you. The button to unlock the cable for removal is my only real complaint about the cable as the button sounds loose when you are setting it up for the first time, and you can't really feel it/notice when you press it in, so you can't always tell when the cable is ready to be removed or not. Aside from that, it does connect and lock easily, and it works well. The connectors also have a respectable amount of protective rubber that travels down the cable enough to where it should work incredibly well at preventing the connector ends from fraying, splitting, or snapping off from the rest of the cable.<br /><br />From a performance point of view, the cable is easily able to deliver on everything it promises- up to 4K at least as I don't own any displays that are higher resolution than 4K to test. However, I was easily able to get the full 144Hz refresh rate out of my monitor, and there were no display issues, distortions, or intermittent disconnects like I was experiencing with my old cable. The cable just works. Additionally, the cable fully supports 10-bit color, and while this may be a placebo effect, I think my display actually looks more crisp and sharper than it did before.<br /><br />Overall, I don't have any complaints about the cable other than what I previously mentioned about the locking tab button as the cable is extremely well made and works flawlessly for my needs. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality DisplayPort cable.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LxTAv5loL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LxTAv5loL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LxTAv5loL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ScTuink9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ScTuink9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ScTuink9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61S6xxnoINL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61S6xxnoINL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61S6xxnoINL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B8SG1WWN,B0BX5LQQSJ,AF7SO6JG76JZKBKRBXAVQJOJBPHQ,2023-02-06 07:30:30.778,0,False,491

It also feels WAY more robust and sturdy.<br />I love the front facing number to let me know which computer is active at any time (vs LED's on the top of the switch that I may or may not be able to see).<br /><br />The built in hot keys (which can be on mouse or keyboard) are really nice and allow you to mount the switch in a location that the button is not necessarily convenient to touch.<br /><br />Be aware that default the switch has a hotkey of pressing right control twice to hotkey switch.<br />If you want to turn off the beep you hit rctrl rctrl b enter and the switch will stop beeping.<br />However... it's important to know that the command is really (and not listed in the instructions as)<br /><br />Hotkey, Hotkey, [command button], enter.<br />So to stop the beeps if you did the command to switch the hotkey to scroll lock becomes:<br />scr lk, scr lk, b, enter.<br /><br />I didn't know this and it was a cause for thinking my switch wasn't working.<br />Which brings me to the seller and their customer service!<br />Explaining the issue to the seller (and the lack of the instructions not mentioning it), I had just assumed my box was not registering the keyboard commands, and the seller I think wasn't understanding the hotkey switching worked but the keyboard commands weren't (not realizing I had switched the command to scroll lck.<br />so my ONLY critique would be to update the instructions a little to point out the commands are related to whatever your hotkey is currently set.<br /><br />They pretty quickly responded to my questions and we were messaging through amazon.<br />The seller then said they would send me a new box because mine wasn't working.<br />They made a youtube video showing it working, they mailed it priority so it got here in two days.<br />Really the best customer service I ever had on amazon.",[],B0BPHNDLNC,B0BPGVGR1J,AEBB4KM3D4BJAA6ZEE2A7XK3AD6Q,2023-01-23 17:48:58.892,4,True,491
386489,2,Disappointing product from CCA,"I’ve used cca iems for a long time and have fallen in love with how balanced and crisp their sound is. I use the CCA C10’s and they fit every need I have, expect one… Versatility.<br />I was stoaked to find out they had a new pair of truly wireless earbuds and I was confident that if they sounded remotely close to as good as their wired counterparts I would love them. Sadly that wasn’t the case.<br />These headphones are rough around the edges and you can tell they are still trying to figure things out. The way the headphones pair to eachother isn’t very smooth. There is a couple milliseconds of lag between the two ears. The right ear plays just slightly but noticeably louder.<br />The sound, is disappointing. It’s the sound you would expect from a pair of 20$ ear buds. Very lacking in the mid section and lacking depth and soundstage. The bass from the 10mm driver is fine and the armature driver designed to play the high end does a good job at playing the high end but that’s it. There should be at least one more driver to fill in the mids.<br />For any mainstream headphone at this price I wouldn’t be surprised with the sound being bad. But for this product to come from cca is surprising. When I first ordered a pair I was so let down with how they sounded that I thought that something was defective with the pair I had, so I sent them back and othered another pair. Sadly I was wrong and they’re was nothing abnormal or broken. That’s just how they sounded.<br />The one thing that I love about them is the comfort, extremely light and ergonomic. Designed to fit the shape of an actual ear instead of looking cool, and they do a great job of that. I can wear them for +8 hours and don’t experience any fatigue.<br />I have hope that cca will continue to improve them and smooth out the kinks. I think the concept they’re going for is phenomenal, and I know that CCA is capable of making an excellent sounding iem. This first attempt at a fully wireless design had the right concept, just poor execution.<br />I would wait for future models to come out before purchasing these.",[],B09FZCQTF1,B09FZCQ1FB,AF6KSFUDYMVJ4M73JXBDXZBTRPIA,2023-03-29 18:42:24.321,0,False,491
790667,5,Ideal for bedroom use,"I was in the market for a 32 inch television for my bedroom and discovered that TCL had two full HD tvs, a Roku and a google tv set.  As I already had a Roku Streambar, which I was going to continue to use as a soundbar, It made sense to go for the Google TV.  Adding weight to the decision, the Google set comes with an ethernet port and the Roku doesn't.<br /><br />How does the TCL 32S356 perform?<br />Picture - The 32S356 comes with a full HD panel and the picture is sharp, clear and bright, I am very pleased with it.  The tv is best viewed straight on as the colors are less bright at an angle.  The tv also picked up when accessing an HDR10 source and informs you that it is running HDR.<br />Digital Tuner - Although this carries less weight on my part as I am using the tv for streaming, the digital tuner appears to be excellent.  It picked up all the major channels and more subchannels than I was aware existed.<br />Streaming - I'm familiar with the Google TV service, my downstairs television has a Chromecast with Google TV streaming device.  I knew that the TV would access every streaming channel I use.  I find the TCL tv to be very responsive.  Initial setup takes a while as you will have to download the current software and download any apps that you're installing.  Once set up, the tv starts quickly and apps load very quickly.<br />Sound - As I had mentioned at the top, I was planning to use the Roku Streambar as a sound bar.  Using the HDMI ARC port, setup was painless.  The TV immediately sensed that it was connected to the Streambar.  I then disabled the soundbar to try the internal speakers.  It's here that the tv falls short.  That said, the internal speakers are adequate, with sufficient volume and clear audio. The frequency response is where the speakers fall short, with no bottom end, the speakers sound a bit tinny.  Without a soundbar, the tv would still be adequate for viewing, but the tv really benefits from an external soundbar.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with my TCL television.  It does everything well and is the perfect fit for a bedroom.",[],B0B4PW231T,B0B4PW231T,AFH6IZ6LTUJAB3QLLC7SIIVEZZHA,2023-02-17 16:32:34.892,0,True,491
708786,5,Great Sound Bar for the price.  Great rear speaker flexibility.,"This is a great sound bar! The flexibility of the removable rear speakers helps this stand out from the rest of the Dolby Atmos sound bars out there. In addition, you can calibrate it to your room. This helps customize it to your room and helps make the sound even better<br /><br />Sound - It is awesome. My home theater sounds like it is surrounded with speakers. The bass is powerful, and even at the default of 3 setting can be overwhelming at times. I don't know how it could be better. The rear speakers sound solid and can be charged via USBC cables or plugged in to the bar to charge. This offers great flexibility since you don't need to have an outlet near each one.<br /><br />Connectivity - No issues whatsoever with the bluetooth connectivity. I love the way it powers on with the TV or streaming device, and can control the volume with any remote. All speakers, including the bass, connect via bluetooth. No need for wires.<br /><br />JBL App - Very easy to use and helps make set up a breeze. You will be using this bar within minutes of installing. It also helps with any updates that are needed. You will probably have one when you first connect.<br /><br />Remote Control - Kind of basic, but the truth is you don't really need it much. The App has a virtual remote as well.<br /><br />Installation - Very easy and all of the brackets you need are included if you are mounting it. I had it attached to the wall within minutes. The JBL app makes the other parts of the installation a breeze.<br /><br />Look - I think it looks great and makes for a clean and expensive look. No cloth covers over any of the speakers, which in my opinion look cheap and can get dirty or rip.<br /><br />Overall - You will not be disappointed with this purchase.  The JBL Bar 1300 or 9.1 are great as well. The downside on the 9.1 is no App connectivity. It is cheaper than this one, but you give up some of the better sound due the additional speakers.  The 1300 is a bit of an upgrade to this one, but there is a cost for the upgrade.<br /><br />Great sound bar for the price range Better than the others in this price range.",[],B0BQPPMBJG,B0CBCQHMHD,AGMMMQGJBGPJKPEMLZZKG6BAK3GQ,2023-03-30 16:20:06.445,0,True,491
670636,4,"Good budget dash cam, but cable is too short for my vehicle","This is a good budget dashcam that is pretty easy to use and install. Unfortunately for myself, the power cable (uses your cigarette lighter) isn't long enough for my vehicle. Measuring out the cable, it came in around 11'2"". For most people, that is probably adequate in length. However, the car I am installing in only has the cigarette lighter power on the back of the console, and the cable length isn't long enough to be able to run it and hide it. That's why I'm knocking one star off of the review.<br /><br />The app itself is pretty easy to use. You simply connect to the camera via WiFi on your phone, and you have access to live video, ability to change the resolution, and how long the video loop is (1, 2, or 3 minutes).<br /><br />It comes with a sticker you place on your windshield that you can then mount the camera to. That way, you aren't attaching it directly to your windshield, so you avoid getting adhesive mess on your windshield.<br /><br />On the top of the camera is an ""open and close"" option (a pic is included of it). That allows you to slide off the plastic piece that has the adhesive that sticks to the windshield. That's a neat feature in case you want to remove the camera and place the camera in another vehicle - however, that would require an additional plastic piece with the adhesive (extra adhesive pad is included, but not the plastic piece that would be needed to mount in another vehicle) and an additional power cable for it.<br /><br />In testing the video, when viewing live, it's not as clear as when going and looking at the recordings themselves. The audio with the video picks up sounds really well. There is an option to turn off the audio in case you don't want it recording that.<br /><br />In order to use the parking feature, you'll have to purchase an additional wiring kit to hook it up directly to your fuse box. So, no parking feature with what is included in the package.<br /><br />Overall, good budget dash cam. I do recommend checking the length of cable that you'd need to make sure you can install it to where the cable is hidden. And, that length of the cable is the only reason I'm knocking one star off of it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ME2ponRuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ME2ponRuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ME2ponRuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YnsVjLJOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YnsVjLJOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YnsVjLJOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ac-TdLt6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ac-TdLt6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ac-TdLt6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oJ0lm7FYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oJ0lm7FYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oJ0lm7FYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kkL0-00mL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kkL0-00mL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kkL0-00mL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VUDMY7aYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VUDMY7aYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VUDMY7aYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BZHHVTNC,B0C4PLDZVC,AEN5NXPAJT2FI34V7WTX3UQGAS3Q,2023-04-15 14:28:51.112,0,False,491
867845,4,Great sounding earbuds to me,"This was my second purchase of these buds because when on sale they beat out every other set that I have tried for volume/headroom and sound quality. The app is basic but these just sound great for a bluetooth set of earbuds imho. I bought a set last year and really like their volume and sound quality abilities. I never use any noise cancellation etc so that never matters to me only sound quality and volume/headroom level abilities. The first set are very reliable as far as quickly connecting to my phone and sound great. I wanted a second set for a new tablet that has low bluetooth volume with the earbuds and headphones that I tried with it and I prefer to use 1 set of buds or headphones per device just to keep things easy. I ordered this new set when it went on sale and connected them then did the update etc and noticed that the left bud was at 20% after around 15 minutes of use while the right bud was at 97%. I tried resetting them every different way that I could find on the Klipsch website but nothing fixed the problem. I contacted Nick from Klipsch support and he was very helpful and to keep this as short as possible ended up sending me a brand new left bud without asking me to return the one that I had. That was refreshing and it came in a few days so I connected it and it did the same thing. What are the odds of that? I contacted Nick again and again he was very helpful and sent me a brand new set including the box, case, cable etc. brand new, never opened. He said for me to try these and make sure that I had a fully functional set of earbuds then send back the original buds, case, box etc with a shipping label that Klipsch paid for. The new set came in a few days and to my delight works great!. I boxed up the defective left buds, the functional right bud, case etc. and shipped it back to Klipsch in Arkansas. When the first bud did not function properly I was dreading having to deal with customer service which I assumed would consist of someone in another country who could not comprehend what I was saying and vice versa, being ignored, put on hold for hours etc. but this experience was the exact opposite of that and I could not be happier with the result.

(I find it odd that the bass gets richer with the ACN on)<br /><br />I think the Audiodo personalization is very cool. (I wish it was available for PC)<br /><br />For my PC, I looked in “Microsoft Store” and found a free utility called “FxSound” that is a “volume booster, bass booster, better sound quality, or an easy-to-use Windows EQ.”  The music from my Amazon Music app, version 9.4.2.2420, is quite a bit richer with this on (using the “Music” preset).  Bluetooth can be a little tricky so the other thing I like about “FxSound” is that it pops up any change to your sound output, so you know when these are connected correctly.<br /><br />Besides my PC, I use these with my big screen TV using the Bluetooth built in to my “Fire TV Stick 4K Max”.<br /><br />To switch back and forth successfully, I find that if I disable Bluetooth on my PC, have these powered off, get in to my home screen for my Fire TV, then turn these on, after a short delay it pops up that they are connected.

959438,5,Sturdy protection for the Kindle Scribe,"First part is on me, I saw ""leather"" and I didn't see ""PU leather"" not that I would know what ""PU leather"" anyhow.  Now I know; the PU stands for polyurethane - or plastic to us non-chemists.  I don't mind that it's not genuine leather, I feel like it may hold up even better than some leather I've seen.  The only downfall is when I first got it, I had to air it outside for a day because it did have a strong odor to it, but it did dissipate.<br /><br />If you're here, then you probably have a Kindle Scribe - don't you love it!?  Unfortunately, I do feel as if one drop and it would be borked forever so a case is important to me for this device.  As soon as I aired it out, I found my Scribe to fit very snugly in place - it's not going anywhere or falling out.  That being said, it goes Kindle > this plastic > ground if you drop it.  I'm not sure if it would protect from a drop, but definitely would from scratches on the screen, maybe even save the screen from a direct hit.<br /><br />The outside plastic cover has a crosshatching pattern probably meant to replicate leather, good lighting, it looks kind of plastic.  However, it does look like it is going to be easy to keep clean.  The inside of the cover is a nice soft felt that rests against the glass screen.  I really like the auto-wake when you open the lid and sleep when you close as I'm not the biggest fan of the side button that does the same.  All in all it seems very durable and looks like it will last a very long time.<br /><br />The plastic channel that holds the pen allows for the magnet to hold the pen in place well, however, there's only a small hole on the backside of this channel where you're supposed to ""easily"" pop the pen out.  I have fat fingers so it's not that easy.  I have found that I can get my fingertip in and roll the pen onto the screen with my thumb in one swoop.

709995,2,They won’t stay in my ears,"On the surface, these seem like good earbuds. The build quality is nice enough- all the materials feel high quality and everything functions as advertised. Pairing with any device is easy and instantaneous, and it functions flawlessly with everything I have tried.<br /><br />Sound quality is pretty good, not great and not terrible. There is a barebones app that gives you some basic EQ functions, and it has a game mode where it allegedly reduces latency (in exchange for what, they don’t say) but I can’t tell a difference from the regular mode.<br /><br />Phone call quality is sub par. For some reason I have a lot of connection issues while trying to make a call, the audio quality is poor and the microphones are pretty weak.<br /><br />So here’s the thing- no matter what I do, these simply won’t stay in my ears! If I put them in and even move a little, they fall right out, never mind coughing or trying to talk to someone on the phone. I genuinely don’t understand how these are expected to stay in place, they have no rubber canal inserts or clips or anything. I think the biggest culprit is that they have a satin finish, which is a lot more slippery. I’ve had better experiences with earbuds that have a glossy finish.<br /><br />And when I try to adjust them, it activates one of the touch controls, so I’m always inadvertently skipping songs or changing something else. The touch controls themselves are ok, but when you constantly have to adjust the earbuds every five seconds to prevent them from falling out, the touch controls are a huge problem.<br /><br />I think the biggest thing is that at $50, you’re in the same price range as earbuds from brands like JBL, JVC, Altec Lansing, Skull Candy etc, and within striking distance of earbuds from Sony, Beats, Belkin, Apple, and other recognizable brands that will deliver a better experience.<br /><br />My personal advice would be to put this money towards another product, especially something from a more recognizable brand with better localization for the USA.

The phone app based on the Play page seems similar to the Wifi Depstech endoscope I have.

It is digital enhancement (FINALLY that sci-fi trope of ""enhance... enhance..."" comes to life!) for better or worse. Still seems like a good resolution at fully zoomed in, but will still it the same walls cameras might for zooming when digital v. lenses.<br /><br />I really did expect MUCH lower quality for $40.

149295,1,WYZE App not working in Android 13,"READ THIS review and you'll see why I rate this camera 1 star.<br />Since WYZE created their first cam, I purchased 5 and liked them UNTIL several things happened:<br />1. Frequent app service outages which prevented viewing.<br />2. Now I am running latest Android 13 on a Pixel phone and the WYZE app won't even open. Did several searches for solution and found this (see my screen capture).<br />3. Despite using the protective shells/housings to use V1 and V2 cams outdoors, they didn’t last.<br />4. Purchased a V3 cam and by then WYZE had become a huge success. Good for WYZE but seemed to slow down their server(s) so viewing live images took longer.<br />5. Then the security breach exposed millions of users so hackers can see video feeds. Took 3 YEARS for WYZE to fix that known problem. Thus, I removed my remaining 3 working Wyze cams from service in 2022.<br />Decided to give WYZE a 2nd chance in 2023 and purchased this Pan V3. Here is why I will NOT use it for my home:<br />1. Design of the mounting bracket would force me to drill more/new holes in exterior wall.<br />2. Design of the plug (L shaped end) would force me to drill a wider diameter hole through an exterior wall.<br />3. Camera lacks internal rechargeable battery. My current DCT cameras can record 24/7.<br />4. Zoom range on my DCT and Hawkray cameras is better. I also tested Dzees which is virtually same as these 2.<br />See my photo comparing them.<br />5. Less motion detection “false alarms” with DCT and Hawkray cameras.<br />6. MOST IMPORTANTLY, VicoHome app for DCT and Hawkray cameras has NEVER had outage or security breach so I am sticking with these trusty cams for exterior security.<br />As I said above, can't even get the WYZE app to open on latest Android so unopened Cam Pan V3 is being returned to Amazon.<br />Hope this review helps someone so I’ll know I didn’t waste my time writing it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31CUMrQUljL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31CUMrQUljL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31CUMrQUljL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LdWUkFMeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LdWUkFMeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LdWUkFMeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B9TWY11Q,B0BVW3V6FR,AH5A4ODVLGRFCCMHNJUBKM2HVYXQ,2023-01-19 00:20:05.866,15,True,490
657627,3,Compatible with wide range of devices,"I ordered this keyboard case for my iPad Air 11”.  The iPad slips into the cover’s rubber protective enclosure.  When my iPad is in place, there are some gaps where the rubber doesn’t completely enclose the ipad (ill fitting). Nevertheless, it seems to hold it in place firmly enough that it isn’t going to slip out.  They keyboard itself is removable and thin.  It attaches to the case magnetically with a firm grip.  The keyboard layout is pretty standard, but has some nice features like function keys that perform IOS functions like copy and paste, as well as audio controls: stop/play, forward/back, vol up and down.  It also has an escape key to exit an app, and a delete key that deletes characters forward (many keyboards only have a backspace key.  It also has arrow keys, but no touchpad for navigating around the document. The keyboard has a power switch to save battery life and a caps lock indicator, which is handy to know why your passwords aren’t working.  The keys are easy to type on, but some of the keys are a little finicky and don’t always register.  The keys are also a bit too noisy-the clacking sound would be distracting if taking notes in a meeting, for instance.  The keys are labeled with decals that look like they could peel or wear off over time.  Since the keyboard is removable, you can just use the case by itself, or take the keyboard along inside the case - it’s thin enough.  One issue is that the location to put the keyboard for closing the case isn’t the place where it needs to be to tilt up the screen and type, so you have to reposition the keyboard when you are ready to work, and move it again when you are ready to pack up.  That’s a little inconvenient.  Finally, there’s a storage spot for a stylus or Apple Pencil in the case, but it doesn’t allow the Apple Pencil 2 to recharge from the iPad when they are both in the case.  Overall, this is likely an adequate keyboard case solution for many folks.  I find some of the shortcomings listed here to be annoying and the case hasn’t yet won me over as a fan.",[],B0BJZMMY2Z,B0BJZMMY2Z,AFAIVD6I7HFYFEIQE6XPQXEZI4QQ,2023-02-23 00:06:58.945,3,False,490
594758,4,Jicjocy Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth Active Noise Cancelling Earbuds Good value Decent Sound.,"The Jicjocy Wireless Earbuds are a great option for those looking for a good value Bluetooth earbuds with active noise cancelling capabilities.<br /><br />What is Jicjocy Wireless Earbuds?<br />The Jicjocy Wireless Earbuds are a set of Bluetooth earbuds that connect to your device wirelessly and allow you to listen to music, take calls, and more. They feature active noise cancelling technology that helps to reduce ambient noise for an immersive listening experience.<br /><br />How does it work?<br />The earbuds connect to your device via Bluetooth and can be controlled using the touch controls on the earbuds themselves. The active noise cancelling works by using microphones on the earbuds to pick up ambient noise and then generating sound waves that cancel it out.<br /><br />What's to like?<br />Fit and finish is nice, making them feel comfortable in your ears and stays in ear properly.<br />Sound quality is quite decent and it is good for listening to music and taking calls.<br />They fit comfortably and stay securely in your ears.<br /><br />What's not to like?<br /><br />Slight lag when watching videos, it can be frustrating if it happens when you want to enjoy something with no distraction.<br /><br />Active noise cancelling, it can sometimes amplify or create unwanted rumbling every now and then due to how it works. They can be exhausting with ANC on, as you can't hear it, but your ear drums will feel it.<br /><br />The touch control is different on each side of the ear piece, so if you lose one you might not be able to activate certain features.<br /><br />The battery life during use could be a bit longer, at least you can charge one and still keeping use one on long chats.<br /><br />Conclusion:  I would give the Jicjocy Wireless Earbuds 4 stars. They offer a great value for their price and decent sound quality, but there are a few downsides, such as the slight lag when watching videos and the active noise cancelling can be a bit hit or miss. Despite these drawbacks, they are still a solid choice for anyone looking for a pair of wireless earbuds with active noise cancelling capabilities.",[],B0BNHZGXV6,B0CCLR6GCC,AGLQUWUA2QAR3WPXYOFTQ73OSP4A,2023-01-10 07:44:34.317,0,False,490

Turning on the unit takes roughly 3 seconds to get to the home screen. Then once you hit the Record button, it takes 9 seconds before it starts to record. Subsequent recording after bootup and after the first recording drops down to 3 seconds.<br /><br />The menus are hard to use because the controls are the up/down buttons on the right side, the play button is ""OK"", and the stop button is ""BACK"". The screen is not the best quality as the contrast of the screen is lacking, and the actual graphics used in the program are of lower quality. It's pretty ugly, honestly, compared to some of the other crisp OLED screens I've seen.<br /><br />I like how the recorder feels in my hand, as it feels nice and solid. It is not a touch screen, so you are at the mercy of the annoying button assignments. I also constantly have to turn the unit around to find the on/off switch, as both sides of the recorder have the same three buttons and I can never remember which side it is on.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quick and intuitive way to record meetings or your classes, this recorder is not for you. It is just too slow, and awkward, and the non-touchscreen is just plain ugly.

32196,4,"Not really for music, but very comfortable.","The Trucker Bluetooth Headset is a bit of a surprise. When I ordered it, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. So, let me walk through what I discovered.<br /><br />First, the Trucker headset is very comfortable to wear, even for an extended period. I have a big head, but the headband fits me well and is comfortable. The clamping pressure seems just right it is strong enough to keep the headset on your head, yet the sampling pressure isn't so great that it becomes uncomfortable. The ear pads are also very soft and comfortable. However, note that the ear pads do not cover your entire ear. That means two things. First, it is easy for this headset to fit your head. Second, they do not isolate you from your surroundings. For gamers, music listeners, or people working in a crowded office, these are not for you. However, if you say work from home and you want to maintain awareness of what is happening around you, these would work well.<br /><br />This headset uses a current Bluetooth standard. That means they are easy to connect to your phone or computer. Moreover, I've never had them disconnect when I was using them. Very expensive earbuds and headsets can't say this.<br /><br />The final thing that impresses me about this headset is that the controls are easy to reach and intuitively placed. For example, the volume controls are two buttons, one is placed on the earpiece in front of the headband mounting, and the other is placed on the earpiece behind the headband mounting. It is doubtful that you are going to engage the wrong control on this headset. Again, not all expensive headsets have all of their controls so carefully placed and easy to use.<br /><br />These headbands are almost entirely plastic, so they are probably not the best choice for children or folks who can be rough on their hardware.<br /><br />The sound quality of this headset is a bit disappointing for the price. Don't get me wrong, if you intend to use these for online conferences, classes, TV listening, or phone conversations, this headset will handle all those situations well. But they are not for music. I know several earbuds and headsets that sound much better at a lower price. I use them for teaching classes online all day, and I like them.",[],B0BRY32C7T,B0BWDZ2VKL,AGZ75YPRRS3C7UZP32XVQQT7RVYQ,2023-03-08 19:18:22.982,1,False,490
874819,3,Solid when they work BUT..,"I got these for Christmas 2022 and have been using them since. The sound is above average to great - but you're used to that if you have any Bose products. I appreciate there are 2 removable attachments for each ear to configure to get a perfect fit. I live in a busy city so I don't use the noise cancelling very much (to be aware of my surroundings) but I have used the feature on flights and it's great.<br /><br />OK, we're done with the positives.<br /><br />From day 1 I've had connectivity issues with these. I think since they were a Christmas present I overlooked the shortcomings but 4 months later I can safely say they completely dropped the ball here. It's to the point where I have a mental Klondike bar if I can get both buds to connect on first try. The audio quality will falter randomly but too often even though my phone is mere feet away - simply unacceptable for the Bose name.<br /><br />I already had to send them in for repair as the audio on the left bud just gave out and after hours of painstaking troubleshooting and frustration I sent them in - to be fair to Bose the process was pretty seamless and I was only without the earbuds for 7-8 days.<br /><br />The app is buggy garbage - it's completely useless in trying to regain connection. One is better off toggling Bluetooth in the phone settings and trying to reconnect there. The app doesn't tell you how much battery the case has left so I just have to remember to charge the case every so often (I believe there's a physical light function to tell you how much battery is left, but c'mon for a premium product they can do better.) Did I mention the app is garbage? The features that are available to you are also pretty buggy but the absolute worst part is that the app does work a lot better when you have good data connection (think 5 bars 5G or good wifi) which leads me to believe that the app is too busy scraping data off your phone to be actually useful to your BLUETOOTH headphones.<br /><br />I hate to say it, but looks like I'll be buying airpods next time I'm in the market which honestly might be sooner than later if Bose doesn't release significant firmware/product updates to these.",[],B0B4PSQHD5,B0BFW3RLZ7,AHUH7ECPBPZAIJYJX7IZ7OQWF5MA,2023-04-18 14:09:08.331,0,False,490
924726,5,Read this if you are having issues with Bluetooth 2 disconnecting,"I love this head unit. I bought it to replace the stock nav that came in my 2007 Hummer H3. It is exceptionally priced and has given my 16 year old truck more features than a brand new car.<br /><br />The only issue I had was with Bluetooth 2. Whenever I paired my phone (to get internet), or my OBD II dongle to use the torque app, it kept disconnecting. Everything would work if I unpaired / repaired the device, but the moment I restarted the car (and thus the head unit) Bluetooth 2 would refuse to connect to my already paired devices. To get them to work again, I would have to unpair and re-pair them, which was super annoying.<br /><br />I should also say that Bluetooth 1, which is used by the head unit for phone calls, worked fine. So I could make calls and stuff, but any extended functionality that you would get from Bluetooth 2 wouldn't work.<br /><br />I finally got fed up, and went to Atoto's website. I registered my head unit and figured I'd try to read a detailed manual about it in case I missed something.<br /><br />Then I found that they have firmware updates on their website. Super easy to download and install, and they keep a whole change log of what fixes each update implemented.<br /><br />So I downloaded the most recent update for my head unit, installed it, and that fixed everything. That is the solution here. Updating the firmware from the Atoto website.<br /><br />I figured it must be software related because if it was the hardware, Bluetooth 2 wouldn't work at all. But it does work, it just doesn't reconnect. With the software update, it does reconnect now and all is well.<br /><br />I can finally use Bluetooth for internet (not a hotspot like I was doing), I can finally connect to my OBD II, and I can finally start on other projects I had put on hold because of the Bluetooth issue. I plan on installing Bluetooth controlled LED cabin lights and a dashcam with Bluetooth event viewing. All possible now that Bluetooth 2 is working.<br /><br />So if you're stuck like I was, go to the Atoto website and download and install a firmware update.

Didn't know what it could really do.<br /><br />Shortly after this arrived at my doorstep, I plugged it in to my Samsung Galaxy mobile phone. The phone acknowledged the device. I inserted a USB thumb drive and was able to view its contents. Then next thing I did was hook up an HDMI cable from this device to my TV while it was still connected to my phone... then the magic really happened.<br /><br />On the TV screen was the Samsung DEX display!<br /><br />What does this mean? It means that using this device through my phone gives me the ability to treat my phone as a desktop-based computer. All I needed to do was connect a USB mouse and keyboard to the device's USB ports, and I'm using my phone like a desktop computer. What an amazing capability! I then connected an active ethernet cable to the RJ-45 port to test network capabilities. Although I don't think you need to do the following, I put my phone into Airplane Mode to shut off all WiFi and carrier data, hoping to be sure I was only relying on the ethernet connection for my network connectivity for testing purposes.<br /><br />IT WORKED!<br /><br />What's more, I plugged my phone charger into the USB-C port provided on the hub, and my phone started to charge. So now, with a few added components, like a portable keyboard/touchpad combo, an HDMI cable, and my phone charger (if desired), I can turn my phone into basically a Chromebook. This works great for on-the-go presentations with Google Office, etc., or just to simply use my phone from the convenience of my TV screen.<br /><br />I'm certainly going to take advantage of that feature in the future.<br /><br />I then plugged the hub into the USB-C port on my Windows laptop. It gave me a notification about having an HDMI video port. I suppose that means in a pinch that I can use the adapter as a 4th video output other than the laptop's built in screen, built-in HDMI output, and built-in VGA output. It also reads SD and MicroSD cards along with USB drives.<br /><br />This is a rather versatile USB-C device.

469200,2,"This product will be going straight into my junk box, or more likely, into the trash can.","Back in the 1970s, when I was around 10 years old, I mail-ordered a miraculous TV antenna that plugged into your home's electrical wiring and converted it into a house-sized antenna. That was, of course, a gimmick product. It's sad to find out that those cons don't go away; they just get repackaged into a different form factor. This TV antenna is the current version of that whole-house antenna.<br /><br />You need to know that I live only three miles away from the broadcast antenna tower of the local CBS affiliate and about six miles from a PBS repeater transmitter. These stations are so close that just putting a paperclip into the TV's coax antenna-in port is often all that is needed to get reception.<br /><br />For testing, I put the antenna in a window on the top floor of my house. I connected it to my TV antenna-in port, plugged the ""amplifier"" into a USB power source, and set the TV to work scanning for digital channels. After the first scan was completed, it detected ZERO channels. I changed the orientation of the antenna and began the channel search again. After the second scan was completed, it again detected ZERO channels. As an experiment, I eliminated the ""amplifier"" and was finally able to get the stations to come in. What gives? Why does it work better WITHOUT the amplifier? The listing gives this warm tip: ""Please switch the amplifier to ""short range"" if your house is very close to the broadcast tower (within 35 miles)."" Sorry, but there is no switch or button anywhere on the amplifier module.<br /><br />I decided to pry open the case of the ""amplifier"" just to see what's going on in there. This doodad is described in the listing as ""SMART SIGNAL BOOSTER AMPLIFIER 450 MILES - This HD antenna built-in Smart IC Chip Powerful Amplifier Signal Booster."" Sorry, but there are no integrated circuits at all in that little module. Just some surface-mount resistors, capacitors, and a few triodes.

594481,4,"Excellent radio!  Small frustrations  (tuning knob, external antennas)","This radio is fantastic in so many ways!  Build quality (other than tuning knob) is great.  The user interface is well-designed:  logical and sophisticated.  Autoscan in each band, saving memory presets for all detectable stations (with just a few false signals bleeding over from other frequencies).  It's easy to switch between memory recall (""VM"" mode) and non-memory tuning (""VF"" mode).  Reception with internal antennas is great in all bands, though some signal overload is evident with external antennas.  Sound quality is great:  some bass, good clarity, fair treble.  Selectable bandwidth setting in all but FM band (very useful for marginal signals).  Stereo/Mono switch for FM (when using earphones; stays Mono with internal speaker).  Displays signal strength and signal-to-noise ratio for all radio bands (and signal-to-noise responds nicely to bandwidth or Stereo/Mono settings).  Bluetooth speaker mode works well.  Haven't tested microSD card playback, but that's also a nice feature.  Rechargeable 2000 mAh 18650 Lithium Ion battery provides hours and hours of use.  USB-C charging.  The amber display can be set for constant LED illumination without impacting battery life terribly.<br /><br />My main disappointment is the tuning knob, which is too small in height and diameter (hard to grip and turn effectively) and rubs against the cabinet.  It is programmed as a fast/slow tuning knob.  Turn it slowly for fine-tuning, faster for standard radio band frequency increments.  Given that it's hard to grip and turn smoothly, this fast/slow design is awkward.  The backward / forward buttons on the 4-way controller also do fine-tuning and more effectively.  I usually avoid standard tuning (""VF"" mode) and instead let autoscan set memories, which in ""VM"" mode one can move between with the tuning knob or the backward / forward buttons.  In ""VM"" memory preset mode, the awkwardness of the tuning knob is less critical.<br /><br />This radio also lacks squelch, useful for shortwave and AM, as provided on more expensive XHDATA radios.

Just to have a Second pair of earbuds as back up I thought I would try these out. I was beyond pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />First of all the case is awesome! It has an indicator on the front that will tell you how charged the case is or how charged each  earbud is which is super handy. I have small ear canals and the skins that were on the earbuds originally fit perfectly which is a  Nice, because I usually have a problem with earbuds being too big.<br /><br />Another problem I usually have is that while talking to people on the phone they always seem to hear the background noise like the train or the street car or the street sounds when I’m walking down the street but not with these. The sound is great not only while listening to a conversation, but participating as well as those in the conversation say that they hear me perfectly.<br /><br />Music sounds pretty good in these as well. If you’re a casual music listener who just likes to put on your favorite playlist and jam out while you’re working out or walking down the street I don’t think you’ll have any problems with the musical sound on these. If you are a musical connoisseur and like your music to be clear with a luxurious rounded sound and booming bass you might not like this so much. I find myself desiring more out of the music aspect of these earbuds, but for the price you really can’t complain at all. They do the job.<br /><br />TLDR:<br />Great for phone calls<br />Grateful working out at the gym<br />Waterproof and durable<br />Plenty of earbud skins to fit different ear types<br />Battery life is long and charge is pretty quickly<br />Noise canceling works well<br />Not the best for music, but they will get the job done.<br />Great back up earbuds or great if you’re looking for a good pair of earbuds on the cheap.<br /><br />Will update in time as usual!",[],B0BRRN8CN5,B0BRRN8CN5,AHTDKLLKARAL3THKDBBESKTUYGEA,2023-03-09 07:42:15.375,0,False,490

I can listen to them for hours.<br />Other advantages of Beyerdynamic DT 1770 Pro:<br />- they are very comfy<br />- noise isolation is very good<br />- wide sound stage<br /><br />Apple AirPods Max and Apple AirPods Pro are good wireless headphones for iPhones and they have balanced sound. I use them on the go.<br /><br />SENNHEISER HD 660 S is a good pair of open headphones and enjoyable too.

309367,4,Right earbud battery is only good for 3 - 4 hours. See the update 2/27/23,"These things fit just fine and the sound is great. I don't usually mess with ANC and could care leass about the heart rate monitor. I get that from my watch or I can just take my pulse.<br /><br />My problem is that the right earbud battery is very short lived - lasts for a little under four hours. The left earbud is good for 6 - 7 hours. I wanted to wear these to bed with Pandora playing to help with my tinnitus, but the right earbud dying usually wakes me up around 2AM.<br /><br />I didn't even open the box until a month and a half after getting them, so I can return them. I guess I'll use them to watch videos on the laptop while the wife watches TV.<br /><br />Actually, the best buds, I have found, that sound great and have good battery life are Samsung's Galaxy Bud+. Unfortunately Samsung doesn't make them anymore.<br /><br />Update - I was contacted by a tech from Anker, who offered me a replacement set of earbuds. I accepted those and received them within a couple of days. There was a definite improvement as the new pair's right earbud lasted about 6.5 - 7 hours. I noted that once the right earbud died, the left earbud had almost a quarter of battery life left. I reported this back to Anker and came to find that was as it should be. They have tested the earbuds to 8-9 hours, more using the charger. But - the right earbud has the heart rate detector in it. So, it will eat battery faster than the left earbud. If you don't care about the heart rate monitor, don't use the LDAC sound/Spatial Audio/soundcore Wellness mode. Your earbuds will last longer.<br /><br />While this was happening, the original pair of earbuds received a firmware update.<br /><br />So, due to Anker's willingness to work with me on this issue, I'm adding a star, and since I have found the method for extending the battery life, I'll add another star. If I actually get the 8-10 hour life, after turning off the un-needed features, I'll probably  kick it up to 5.",[],B0B9M552J4,B0BGZLR2BR,AEBG276XUZAL5EI5HHO5SSHX46OQ,2023-02-16 14:05:00.812,9,True,490
743145,5,Best Zip Tie Tool That I Have Owned,"Over the years in my business, I have used thousands of wire ties. I have used other Zip Tie Tools with varying degrees of success. Many is the time that I have reverted back to my trusty needle nose pliers and wire cutters. After familiarizing myself with this Superun Zip Tie Tool, I really like the way that it functions. It is narrow and well designed to work in tight spaces. It works well on a number of widths, from tiny to large wide zip ties.<br /><br />How to use the tool: This tool operates like a pair of pliers or wire cutters. There are 2 handles, a long and a short, on one side of the tool. The other side of the tool has a single long handle. To use the tool, first wrap the zip tie around the item. Then insert the zip tie in to the binding end of the tie and slightly hand tighten it. The 2 handle side of the tool, is the same side where the end of the zip tie, is inserted in to the tip opening in the tool. The tie end will slip through through the slit/opening, past the cam gear teeth that will grip the tie. Then squeeze the 2 long handles together, to tighten the zip tie to the desired amount. (Do not over tighten) Once tight, the remaining waste portion of the zip tie can be cut off by depressing the short handle. Note: The short handle moves the cut-off blade. Be careful not to accidentally squeeze the short handle while gripping the two long handles. If done, it will cut off the zip tie before it is tight.<br /><br />I will offer a few other tips on using this tool: If your zip tie end is inserted in this tool correctly, it really locks on to the tie. It will in fact, hold it so tightly that one can stretch and break the zip tie. You have to get the feel for it to avoid over tightening. Also, whenever possible, insert the end of the zip tie in to the tip of the tool, as straight as you can. The cutter will of course cut off the zip tie at the same angle that it was inserted in to the tool. Angle cuts will leave a sharp point where the zip tie was cut. The sharp angle can be easily corrected with wire cutters or scissors.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful.",[],B0BC184T32,B09XB3J7SS,AGWTOGJS4RXLFKPV3SH3RH25LYMQ,2023-01-22 21:42:59.077,1,True,490
478220,4,Nice lightweight unit - tablet or keyboard mode,"I have a couple of these keyboards for my iPad and they are all pretty good.  No one knocks it out of the park the way Apple does but then again, I can buy 6 of the reasonably priced ones or ONE Apple keyboard. Not everyone can afford a $300 keyboard so...I have two of these.  What I like about this, other than price, is that it's light.  My backpack already weighs a ton so I downsized from the 12.9 in Pro to a 10 in Air to save on weight.  Some of the keyboards I've tried almost bulk up the Air to the weight of a Pro which defeats the purpose. This one is light.  It was a no brainer to get connected to the air, charges using USB-C (believe it or not that's huge because so does the Air...and some companies are still using the very slow micro-USB which also requires another cable). I like that it has a tablet mode (i.e. turn, flip and lay flat) and also a keyboard mode (stands like a laptop) because I find myself needing both and the keyboards that lack this feature mean struggling the iPad out of the case...and then having to store the case...which is doubly annoying when traveling.  Anyone who has been on an airplane in the last 5 or so years gets it.  The seat in front of you is only ""far enough"" when you are in the Economy Plus section so this is great for the rest of the plane.  I have two complaints: first, unlike the other unit I have this one is likely going to scratch from being put in and out of the bag.  The other one I have has a coating that will prevent that.  The other one however also has a right shift key that is half the size of a normal one so thats why I replaced it with this one.  The second thing I dont care for are the little brackets they use to hold the iPad in place.  Typical cases use compression into a rubberized fitting.  This uses two little rotating brackets.  I dont think they will ever break (too small with too little exposure) but I would prefer compression only.  Overall I am glad I made the switch and will likely use this one going forward.  Its worth the price unless you really want to spend $300 with Apple.  It's a win.",[],B0BRKRVMN6,B0C3ZSMH21,AGVWL3IMABWTK2J6YBR4T4HXBW2Q,2023-03-30 12:55:23.590,0,False,490
169838,2,Lots of issues with this TV,"I got this TV with such high hopes. I’m a huge Amazon fan and was excited to get a firetv and saw that the reviews were mostly positive.<br /><br />Unfortunately— I started having issues upon setup. You are able to select your Amazon account as the account you will use during setup before you purchase the tv, so I was expecting an easy set up process. This was not the case. It kept telling me that an account was already connected, but when I went into the backend it said that Amazon account was my own. I ended up on live chat with Amazon customer service for around 1 hour troubleshooting the issue. I was told it was something that wasn’t accurately set up on their end. Either way— very frustrating.<br /><br />Once the tv was set up, I started noticing more issues. The Home Screen often doesn’t load the preview images or app images (as seen in photo). Some of the apps have major issues that I never had with my Roku. I constantly try restarting the tv, making sure the apps are updated, the tv OS is updated, and have tried clearing the cache or the data for apps that aren’t working correctly. I’ve tried installing and reinstalling apps. I have Fios Wi-Fi and it works perfectly for streaming on other devices in my home and I have tested the speed multiple times before to make sure it’s fast enough.<br /><br />Peacock buffers terribly to the point where I can’t watch episodes because it is so bothersome. On my Roku upstairs (connected to the same Wi-Fi) I have no buffering issues with Peacock. Paramount+ simply does not play any movie or tv episode, just attempts to load, and then gives an error message. HBO Max will crash occasionally, and sometimes has the same buffering issues as Peacock. Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+ and Hulu never have any buffering issues at all. Which is baffling.<br /><br />Overall, I give the smart features 1 star because of the above experiences. I just want the tv to work and play the episodes on the streaming apps that I pay for.<br /><br />The picture is the one thing I would give 5 stars. When it’s working— the 4K is stunning.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xpi3ZdK-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xpi3ZdK-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xpi3ZdK-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08P3QB66R,B0971YMVC8,AG2AXZCONLY76B55EDLWMT37TCTA,2023-03-24 20:02:57.779,2,True,490
120784,3,"A fine cable for DIY jobs, but not much else.","I'm going to start by saying that if you're planning on buying this cable just to extend a regular 9-pin USB header, don't even bother. There are plenty of proper 9-pin header cables that will just plug right in without any fuss. In fairness to the people who gave this thing one or two stars because they had to break a pin off in order to use it on a normal header: I don't know who would actually need a 10-pin header cable - unless the sole reason is to modify it.<br /><br />What this cable is great for; is resolving issues caused by OEMs who like to use annoying proprietary components. For example, you want to connect a new motherboard to a pre-existing front-IO board with an old cable, but you can't because the pinout isn't standard, this will resolve it. However, it's going to take a little work. You're more than likely going to have remove and rearrange the pins to make it work. In my case, I used two of these cables to connect a new Gigabyte motherboard to the factory FIO board of an Alienware Area 51 R2. It was chore of popping the pins out with a small flathead screwdriver and triple-checking to make sure they were all lined up with the original female-to-female cables but in the end, it worked.<br /><br />What I really dislike about these cables though, is the design. The manufacturer opted to separately jacket each half of the wires, with makes the cable unnecessarily bulky. I assume this was an attempt to make identifying both halves of the cable's wiring easier, since they are the same colors, but this was frankly a terrible solution. Also, the cable is just comically long. I know there's some people - like myself, who enjoy building out of really strange cases, but I've never found myself in a situation where I needed almost 4 feet of header cable. This all makes routing these cables needlessly messy. They could make it a third of the length and I'm sure it would be fine for most people.<br /><br />In closing, if you deem it suitable for your project and aren't afraid to get your hands dirty, this cable will work for lack of a better solution. The build quality is fine and the price is decent, but the design could be a whole lot better.",[],B06Y663F3S,B06Y663F3S,AGC3K7H7LC33NJHJSW5MTWUTBHWQ,2023-02-25 02:07:29.809,0,True,490

I looked up the price today so I can comment on it's ""value"" and I am genuinely surprised at how cheap it is! I've had cameras over $100 that didn't perform half as good as this!<br /><br />To set it up, all you have to do is download their app, make a login, and have the camera scan the QR code in the app and it's setup! Super quick and painless! And putting the camera up on the porch consisted of drilling 4 screws in so that was super easy! Comes with a template to help you mount it perfectly straight or whatever but I didn't use that and it still looks good.<br /><br />Functionality- this thing spins all the way left and right (wont spin in circles but it does reach all the way to each side.) Then it's range of looking up and down is really good too. I posted this on a porch post out front and I can turn the camera to the left and look down to see when Amazon delivers my packages now! Truly impressive the coverage this one camera has!<br /><br />Night vision has like 3 different modes- one of them I think it keeps the spotlight on (which is BRIGHT) and I can see my car in full color/crystal clear from a few feet away! Another mode is just black and white with the IR lights on. And the other mode is black and white but it switches the spot light on and goes to full color when it sense motion.<br /><br />I need to see if it has a sensitivity setting because the on bit of annoyances is that as is- it catches motion of bugs and everything under the sun so I look at my phone and have 30 alerts at any given time from the camera! Hopefully I can fix that but even if not, I am happy with the camera for the price point!<br /><br />Picture- it auto starts off in standard def but you click that icon and it switches it to HD which is MUCH clearer!!<br /><br />Overall I'm truly amazed by this and will be buying a few more to cover my current house and the house we're remodeling.

636430,5,"Awesome Speaker; I’d Give This 6 Stars, If I Could","I’ve had the Marshall Stanmore III Bluetooth speaker for about a month and wanted to give it plenty of use before writing up a review. I gotta say, it’s awesome! By far the best Bluetooth speaker I’ve tested and reviewed. I have past experience with Marshall amplifiers, so I had certain expectations for this speaker - this speaker definitely lives up to the Marshall name.<br /><br />The speaker is the perfect size for a bookshelf or a bedroom. According to manufacturer specs, it’s roughly 14”x8”x7” and weighs in at a hefty 9 pounds, holding one (1) 50W and two (2) 15W amplifiers. It appears to be well made and has the same look and feel as my Marshall amp. The exterior is a soft feel/touch plastic; the front has the fabric liner covered in a plastic mesh; and trimmed out tastefully in gold and the Marshall name. On top, the gold/brass dials and on/off switch look just like the Marshall amp toggles. The bottom has rubber “feet” which provide a nice sturdy base and prevent and rattle or vibration. Overall, this looks like a piece of art; truly well done.<br /><br />So how does it sound? It’s perfectly balanced, with clear highs and mids. The bass has that punch that you can feel, without sounding harsh or distorted. Overall, it’s such a clean sound. Volume-wise, this speaker definitely has the juice to shake the walls. I truly have no complaints about this speaker.<br /><br />There’s a Marshall app which connects to the speaker and provides some more finely tuned features; based on the speaker’s positioning, distance from the wall, etc. A cool feature, but I don’t really use it. Once you have your speaker set and tuned to your liking, I don’t really see for the app.<br /><br />The speaker itself is a little more costly than other comparable Bluetooth speakers, but I’d say this lives up to the price tag. The sound is incredible and the look has a type of class and style that makes you want to show this speaker.<br /><br />I think this a fantastic speaker and would definitely recommend it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610ltcTXv3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610ltcTXv3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610ltcTXv3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rFaB-pojL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rFaB-pojL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rFaB-pojL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81848+bNdlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81848+bNdlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81848+bNdlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81TUDzGyqjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81TUDzGyqjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81TUDzGyqjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09HTFCR59,B09HTVQ6CX,AHS6V5O3NSNIRE6BLVT7QDM27UNQ,2023-02-17 16:30:10.635,0,False,490
51798,4,"Affordable NOAA Radio and Flashlight, would not use phone charger","I recently learned of NOAA radio and wanted to have one on hand for emergencies. This little device is great! Not only does it have a NOAA radio, it also has AM/FM radio and a flashlight. It can also be charged by sunlight or hand crank in addition to a standard USB C charger.<br /><br />I've been using this flashlight when I walk my dog in the evening. The wrist strap is nice, it means I'm not too worried about it slipping out of my hands. However, buyer beware, it appears to be housed in cheap plastic and feels more like a kid's toy - I'm not convinced this device will last, particularly if it did drop. It's got three LEDs and they are bright enough. Only one mode too - it turns on and off, no modes or strobe lights, which I really appreciate. I used it two nights in a row as a flashlight without charging, but I'm not sure how long either the radio or flashlight would run in an emergency.  Also the manual was a little unclear - it said something about using the hand crank 3-5 minutes before use. Like once? or every time I use it? Seems like a lot, but to be safe I hand crank for 30 seconds or so while leaving.<br /><br />The battery charging indicator light is confusing too. If you're using a cable, the light flashes when charging, but the light remains solid when you use the crank or solar. I think most devices use a flashing light to indicate charging, so that just makes it confusing, but I suppose it it blinked, it might make it look like the solar/cranking is going on/off/on/off, so maybe that was intentional.<br /><br />Left on a kitchen counter in sunlight, in charging indicator light was on. I fully charged with USB after I first received it and now am trying to rely on the crank/solar to get a better understanding of how it works/how long it takes to charge/run out.<br /><br />I wouldn't rely on this device for charging other devices. The battery is 2000 mah, so not enough to charge all phones to 100%, it's good for an emergency like if you need a few % to send a text or place an emergency call.

The battery life seems fine under normal office use - using it for number-crunching simulations kills it quicky, as one would expect, so no real complaints there.  The keyboard is a little firmer than I would like - I've been spoiled by IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad keyboards - but it's better than many laptops I've had or tried.<br /><br />My biggest complaint, honestly, is that the keys I hit most often are starting to get that partly-polished, shiny look. It's not finger oils; I clean the keyboard every so often, and the polished portions remain and are getting larger.  It's not yet a durability issue, but it's not a great look and I wish it weren't happening so fast.<br /><br />Overall, there are other options that come, let's say, 70-80% of the way to this thing's capabilities at around half the price; but they probably weigh more.  If you can do with less ram, storage space, and CPU and GPU power, you probably don't need this machine.

775725,5,Good Working Binoculars with 8X Magnification and 9-10’ Close Focus Range,"One of our granddaughters is fascinated by our binoculars when we visit and birdwatch in her Florida back yard. She has a pair of toy binoculars, but they are probably more discouraging than helpful. These pink Boosigant Compact Binoculars are both cute and functional 8X magnification binoculars with a surprising close focus of 9-10 feet. They are lightweight, sized for small hands, and protected by a rubber coating. The eye pieces have wide and soft cups. The focus wheel is a little stiff, but will probably loosen with use; nonetheless, they are easy to adjust. Both focus and color look good. The accessories are less impressive, but still helpful. The strap is difficult to thread through the ring on the binoculars without unraveling it (I used tweezers) and it’s a thin strap all the way around, though the binoculars are so lightweight that a thin strap is probably fine. The barely-big-enough storage case is made of a thin and stiff neoprene-like material with a belt loop and a hook-and-loop closure that will keep dust from the lenses and focus mechanism. There are instructions for adjusting and focusing the binoculars, but none for attaching the strap. If you’ve not attached this type of strap before, see my instructions below and the photos. I think my granddaughter will love these binoculars and they work just like her grandmother’s.<br /><br />Instructions for threading the strap onto the binoculars: 1) set the binoculars on a table with the eye cups up, 2) pull some slack in the part of the strap that is already threaded through the buckle so there’s a loop sticking out of the top of the buckle, 3) align the strap so that the bare crossbar of the buckle is facing toward the binoculars, the loop is facing away, and the loose end is hanging down 4) thread the loose end of the strap nearest that buckle through the bottom of the loop on the binoculars (i.e., up toward the eye cups), 5) thread the same end through the bottom of the buckle and over the crossbar, underneath the loop you made earlier, 6) leave a little of the loose end free and tighten the straps in the buckle, 7) repeat with the other side.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dHJrblwdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dHJrblwdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dHJrblwdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oeHAsGnkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oeHAsGnkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oeHAsGnkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BVHGLZMQ,B0BXKBMZF8,AHQGVAYHVD4U3BJXTGQYRFQTXM6A,2023-04-14 20:22:47.058,2,False,490

Tons of compliments at the office are guaranteed (speaking from personal experience)<br />✅ NON-SLID. has 5 silicone “grips” at the bottom. anyone who says otherwise must’ve already lost theirs.<br />❌ SIZE. “full size” is referencing the numeric keypad, which would typically not be present on a compact size keyboard. While this not a tenkeyless keyboard, it is also NOT full size! Some alphanumeric keys have been dramatically reduced in size (Space bar, Shift, Caps Lock, Tab, Enter, and Backspace) and additional layout modifications will put this keyboard in the same range as “75% compact” but with a numberpad.<br />❌ LAYOUT. I don’t know what type of evil designer must you be to come up with the idea of placing the Delete key in exact location of where the Backspace key would located on any standard keyboard???<br />As someone who’s already had to go through the pain of relearning how type, I can tell you that muscle memory takes time and practice, and there is absolutely no reason why anyone should be forced it upon themselves to learn a new typing method when you can just buy a differed keyboard instead of this atrocity.<br />❌ STIFF KEYS. surprise mode sticky keys- all keys but at random times. expect the unexpected by pounding on each key you type.<br />❌ DELAYED RESPONSE. very bad for IM users or anyone who takes frequent breaks between sentences<br />(30 second or longer)<br /><br />Mouse:<br />✅ REDUCED NOICE. not silent per se, but a muffled click is still better than “clicking” click.<br />❌ NON-ERGONOMIC.

943655,5,A welcomed added sense of security,"The 2-pack of Aomeisi wi-fi security cameras and hardware arrived boxed securely nestled in form fitting foam. The instruction manual is extremely detailed making the set-up go a lot smoother than anticipated. Having QR Codes available also helped when it came time to synch the camera to both our Android phones. Aside from drilling the holes to mount the housing, the set-up of the first camera (with two phones) took approximately 40 minutes.<br /><br />The housing to hold the camera is sturdy and durable. The camera attached easily to the fixture. It would have been appreciated if the cord was longer. As it is, it must drape across the wall to the only outlet by our front door. An extension cord will obviously solve the problem, but again, a longer cord will probably be warranted by most. Beside that issue, the device is sleek an unobtrusive in appearance.<br /><br />As of this writing, the cameras have been exposed to the rain twice along with 35mph winds. On both occasions, service was not interrupted nor was the picture quality hampered. The security cameras switch from day to night mode automatically. In both settings, the images appear to be clear with no pixeling noted. At nigh time, it is a treat to see the animals that walk through our backyard. Who needs a trail camera when the Aomeisi camera does the trick.<br /><br />Being able to talk with a visitor from inside the house is one of my favorite features. There are many other capabilities of this security device that I have not seen on others. The motion sensitivity levels are a plus especially with year-round insects. No more waking up to a false alarm caused by some creepy crawling pest. We haven’t had the need to use all of the bells and whistles of this system, but it nice to know that they are available when the occasion arises. This wi-fi security packages is definitely more than I was expecting.<br /><br />Note: AS a Vine Voice, it is my intention to help sellers improve their product while highlighting the features of it. I also try to be as detailed as possible with my feedback so that prospective buyers have a more complete “view” of the product.

883432,5,"Amazing, very cool universal remote control with hub, all in one smart remote. Over my head.","This SofaBaton universal remote comes with an app and is an all in one smart remote. It's definitely smarter about what it does than I'll ever be. My friend set this up for me, and it's great once it's all set up, but I'd still be trying; this isn't due to the SofaBaton being difficult to set up but is due to my lack of knowledge about such things.<br /><br />The remote works with over 500,000 devices from over 6,000 brands, including TV, DVD, Blu-Ray, cable boxes, streaming players, etc. I have a Samsung smart TV and a small JVC regular TV, and it works very well with both of them.<br /><br />The SofaBaton app works with iPhones and androids, and it's compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant. It does a wonderful job of changing between modes of watching television - from live TV to streaming to recordings. I just have no clue whatsoever as to how it does all the things it does.<br /><br />I do understand the basic idea of the SofaBaton - you have one remote that controls everything and does everything but walk the dog. You can create customized activities for your home entertainment system, whatever that may be, and you can set it up to do anything you want it to do as far as recording, streaming, music, whatever. You can set it for starting and controlling devices in groups or individually, directly with a touch, or with custom schedules. Once you get the hang of it, it's really not that technical. If it was, I couldn't do it.<br /><br />Excellent product, an amazing universal remote control for all your devices. How it works is entirely over my head, but it works very well. It comes with its recharging hub, and its app works on both iPhones and androids. It also works with Alexa or Google Assistant. This is a very, very smart remote that any man would love; the more gadgets, the better. Now that someone else set it up for me, I love it, too; it makes doing what you want to do with your TV, music, streaming, recording, you name it much easier.

Large, but slightly smaller than listed","[[VIDEOID:683d55cbe7f09b1181abd001cb470c32]] Today I'm reviewing his black photo backdrop,<br /><br />As you can see it comes in a nice very large, zippered bag that measures about 18x14x4 inches in size. Now I'll remove the backdrop and the four plastic clamps. The clamps have a pretty nice amount of spring tension so they should hold well. The ends have a hinge to ensure you get good contact. The clams are about 3 inches wide at the handle and 4.5 inches tall. You only receive four clamps, so that may not be enough depending on how you plan to hang this.<br /><br />I'm seeing some green fluff on the backdrop. I don't know if it shipped this way or if the fluff came from my green screens. I'll have to open this up to take a picture. Let's get an idea of the thickness of this material. It seems pretty think, when I try to look through it the fabric seems to do a good job blocking light. This is fairly opaque. I'll open this up and measure it.<br /><br />The fabric is smooth but does have some wrinkles.<br /><br />You can see the comparison to my old black backdrop on top, which is actually doubled over. On the bottom is this new one (this item). You can easily see through my old one and even get a hint of the green screens. I'm very impressed with the thickness and light blocking ability.<br /><br />The only downside I see is that it is not true to size and when measured it was just over 19 feet by 9.5 feet. So, a foot short in one dimension and half a foot in the other. Since I won't have to double up this backdrop, I'm fine with the slightly shorter than expected size.<br /><br />I'm rating this five out of five stars<br /><br />Pros<br />- Thick fabric blocks light well<br />- Has rod pocket on two sides<br />- Remaining 2 sides have a sewn edge<br /><br />Cons<br />- Backdrop is undersized.

58583,5,"Great gaming motherboard, prices are higher on Amazon","This is a great looking, stable motherboard with a lot of futureproof features built into it.  I'm using it to run my new 13700KF and some 6400 speed DDR5 RAM, and I've had zero issues so far.  There are lots of fan headers to help control airflow if you don't want to rely on buggy software, and the BIOS lets you set fan curves pretty easily.  Overclocking is easy, and this has plenty of power phases to make sure that overclock will remain stable.  TPM was enabled by default so I didn't have to worry about changing that to get my Windows 11 boot drive to fire right up, and even the basic BIOS menu that you see on first boot let me enable XMP for my RAM right away.<br /><br />One thing that wasn't super clear until I RTFM was that installing an M.2 NVMe drive in the one marked ""Blazing"" would lower my GPU's PCIE lane allocation.  When you remove the heat-sink that sits right above the primary GPU slot, there are actually 2 M.2 ports there, one to the left and one to the right.  If you put a drive into the one on the left your GPU will run at full PCIE 5.0x16 and the M.2 drive will run at PCIE 4.0x4, but if you populate the M.2 drive on the right, even if it's just a PCIE 4.0 NVMe drive, it will automatically lower your GPU to only using 8 PCIE lanes because it assumes you've installed a PCIE 5.0x4 NVMe drive.  It is called out in the manual, but it wasn't something I realized until after I'd booted everything up so it required a bit of rework.<br /><br />My only real gripe is that prices on Amazon are about 10% higher than other competitors here in the USA.  I still bought it here because I wanted the free shipping and I either don't trust or have had bad experiences with some of the competition (looking at you, egg company), but it would have been nice not to have to pay a premium to do so.  4.5/5 overall because the board itself is very nice, but the price increase drops it half a star when buying it on Amazon IMHO.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71m73Nk1IFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71m73Nk1IFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71m73Nk1IFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BJF1RS19,B0C1ZXV5P1,AH5OQSQMFRYV2XSFLDJDWODXUJGA,2023-03-07 00:30:23.565,0,True,490
834351,1,Nearly Impossible to Program Because of Cryptic Key Functions,"Like all cheap electronics this scanner has convoluted cryptic programming. It has those annoying multiple function keys that force you to do all manner of key pressing. You know the routine, press 1 then 4, then 5 which turns the 8 key into enter, but if you press 1 then 5, then 4, the 8 key becomes a delete key.<br /><br />In this case, you have to press and hold the ""HOLD"" key, enter a channel number, then press ""E"" (for enter). There is no acknowledgement of your entry. If you make a mistake entering any data, your only option is to clear the entire entry and start over, so you had better get it right the first time. If you are lucky enough to program your channel, you cannot simply go on to the next, you have to exit, then start all over from scratch. By the way, the instruction manual does not tell you that the volume key is used to scroll through the menu, as well as scroll through the alphabet when you enter labels for the channels.<br /><br />Speaking of the volume knob, it serves three separate functions depending on how many times you press it, and as usual there is no indication of what mode it is in, you just have to rotate it and see what happens.<br /><br />I programmed a few channels to scan interesting frequencies at Fort Lauderdale Airport. When I was finished, I pushed the scan button, and nothing happened except for a message that said all channels were locked out. I returned to the set-up menu and scrolled down to the unlock all channels and selected it. Still nothing. In other words, I now have a $115 chunk of useless plastic cluttering my house.<br /><br />This is definitely not a user-friendly device, so you had better keep the user manual within easy reach if you expect to use this scanner in the future. The only problem with that plan is that the user manual really sucks. It explains how to do the basic set up (sort of) But it offers no help if you want to change any settings once programmed, for that you are on our own using trial and error.<br /><br />As for me, it is winging its way back to Amazon as I write this review. I am not looking to learn a whole new programming language just to use what should be a simple scanner.",[],B00772MR0K,B0829BWDWC,AHJNM7YO6FZLZDJVUTDIIYFDBR4Q,2023-01-24 21:37:06.166,1,True,490
987101,4,Good sound but low volume,"The TV we hooked this up to had a low volume issue; we would have to turn the volume all the way up to 100 to get what was normally a ""normal"" volume level for listening. We thought getting a sound bar would help us to be able to turn up the volume more and hear better; so this is the first attempt. The HDMI ARC connection worked easiest; unfortunately this resulted in the sound not being any louder than what the TV produced. I don't know if it's because of the TV's sound output limitations or this speaker's limitations. I was hoping the speaker could amplify the TV's sound better but it definitely didn't via the HDMI ARC cable. I tried using the included optical cable, and couldn't get it to work at all. I have used optical cables successfully in other applications, so I believe it was not user error. The optical cable was really thin. So either it's a bad cable, or a bad port on either the TV or speaker. The third try was using an aux cable. The TV only had a headphones out jack, which happened to be the only type of cable they didn't include. However, I found a spare laying around my house and hooked it up to this speaker using the aux to aux cable (think headphones jack on both sides of the cable). This worked. We could turn the speaker all the way up, and then still use the TV remote to control the volume because the TV out volume was still coming out of the headphones jack and was subjected to the TV's volume control. The sound though seems a bit distorted if it is turned all the way up; probably because the headphones jack isn't made for that type of output. However, essentially now the speaker is amplifying the 100 volume level of the TV, and so we get good volume. Overall I like the sound output by the speaker, I just wish it was higher volume. The front display on the speaker goes from 0 (or 1) to 30 for volume adjustment. The Bluetooth feature worked fine, I connected it to my iPhone easily. It played music from my phone and sounded great, but again, wasn't very loud. All in all, a nice speaker if you don't need anything loud. If you are wanting high volume to overcome other noise, then this speaker won't cut it. But if you are in a quiet setting and only need medium volume, this will work great.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81i5VZN4swL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81i5VZN4swL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81i5VZN4swL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BMTTHV8J,B0BMTTHV8J,AG4Q5S74DVMTEMCSYJIPII62FELA,2023-01-26 21:14:16.442,0,False,490

684640,4,Read this if you're planning on using this for an industrial radio.,"I'm going to lead with the fact that I work as a millwright and bought these for my work radio. It's a Motorola CP200d. That's less important for compatibility than your handset though, make sure yours has an audio jack before buying, not all radio handsets do.<br /><br />The sound dampening is good, they function as regular ear plugs and I don't feel like my hearing is in danger even in the loudest parts of the mill.<br /><br />The fit is decent, I'm not normally a fan of the flanged silicone style ear plug, I've always found them painful in my ears by the end of the day, but these are made from a very soft silicone that's grippy but not uncomfortable.<br /><br />The sound quality is decent but nothing to write home about. I would have rated higher, but there's a concussive burst at the start of each transmission that's distracting till you get used to it, which takes a few hours. Other than that I can hear pretty clearly and it's helping a lot with my ability to communicate when I'm working in high noise areas, particularly when I have to have muffs over my plugs.<br /><br />My actual cons for this are in the pic. The plugs stuck straight out of my ears. A bend at the end of the plug would be a huge benefit because it bumps into things in close quarters which is distracting, and I can't wear a beanie over my hears. The latter is my biggest issue, we're in the actually cold part of winter out here on the Washington coast and I have to work outside in the rain and sleet a lot, and my ears are getting cold.<br /><br />My other con is that the wire is super stiff, which makes it a little hard to route so that it stays out of the way and won't get snagged.<br /><br />If I were to give feedback to Elgin, I would say to add a bend to the plug end and use a more flexible cord coating like a braided sheath, you could probably lose the nice storage case to keep the cost similar to what it is. Several guys I work with also bought these, and since we have personal radios we don't have much need for the storage because they stay plugged into our hand sets while they're charging.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81xQ-o5G8LL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81xQ-o5G8LL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81xQ-o5G8LL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B078YFYJFT,B07P14PZTP,AEENWIVUR65EGY3AKM4BYTLYNJSA,2023-03-10 03:25:55.461,4,True,490

My head is 21"" circumference, and the band doesn't hurt after hours of wearing it.

So in Vizio released the soundbar, I was excited because they're one of the few companies that actually create an option without a subwoofer as they are some of the few that understand the practical challenges of owning an audio system. Honestly the technology's got so good now, that unless you live in a large space, the value of a subwoofer is really not justified it seems. The sound on this speaker is of excellent clarity. Voices come through clearly. Bass is excellent as it enhances the watching experience to have a more dramatic impact rather than just simply being punchy. The atmos orientation of the speakers is very effect. Watching shows like drive to survive which involves formula 1 drivers racing around, actually feels like cars are driving past you, not just on a television. For those who use an Amazon fire stick device, make sure you plug it directly into the soundbar HDMI in port. From there route the HDMI cable from the arc port into the TV. There's a slight delay in processing, which is most prominent in the lag of the closed captions to keep up with speech. The remote is well laid out and the same one used across many devices. It is not entirely intuitive, so I recommend you read the user manual to know how to adjust things like the treble and bass. Night mode is a useful function so as to not disturb folks sleeping by turning down the bass an appropriate amount. For some reason all the equalizer presets aren't available. I'm not sure if this is because I have an older Vizio TV, it is due to the Amazon fire stick, or some other reason. Also there is a true volume button which equals out the noise level across different media to prevent jarring differences from one channel or source to the next. This is really what I love most about Vizio, they are in some ways like the new generation of consumer electronic companies that understand is not just about the hardware, but also the user-friendly design of the units which actually allow optimal use and thus full extraction of its value.

710768,2,Random shutdowns under heavy CPU load,"I currently own an Asus Strix Z690 D4 but wanted to move to DDR5 and I was waiting for a decently priced open box 2-dimm board to become available when one popped up so I snagged it from Amazon Warehouse.<br /><br />It arrived basically looking near brand new (few blemishes here and there) but I did notice the stickers had been removed and reapplied so it HAD been used sometime in the past. It was open box so that was to be expected.<br /><br />The board is solidly constructed and pleasing to the eye. The sheer amount of pack-ins is astounding. If you're into flair and tchotchkes this has them in abundance. There was no manual included. I'm not sure if it was meant to have one or if MSI does the QR code route.<br /><br />After updating the BIOS from a circa 2021 revision to the newest A.90 I outfitted it with my pre-existing components (12900k, Samsung 1TB SSD, MSI 4090, 1600w PSU) and away we go. It was also outfitted with a set of Trident 2x16GB 7600 DDR5 modules. I was able to dial in the memory to 7400 @ 34-43-43-34 rock solid (TM5 and WMD passed).<br /><br />Everything seemed to work well from stress testing the GPU to the memory and more. Gaming was fine too. The problem was once placed under a meaningful CPU load the system would randomly shut down. No warnings, nothing...just complete power off.<br /><br />CPU temps were fine along with VRM temps. It would just power off. I swapped in a 12400 and a 12100 and they ran fine under sustained load indicating an issue with much heavier loads being subject to a motherboard issue.<br /><br />I swapped everything back to my Strix Z690 D4 and with the 12900k under the same heavy CPU load scenarios that caused random immediate shutdowns of the MSI Unify-X, it ran just fine for 30-60min stress tests.<br /><br />Pity as it was a good price and I really liked the aesthetics of the board except for the BIOS indicator light which is ALWAYS on. One position is is a glaring white. The other is an even worse red.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZWrHBZn1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZWrHBZn1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZWrHBZn1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09KL5STGL,B09KL5STGL,AE7YDA2CNR4UMPCXINIUA5UPNQGQ,2023-02-17 21:25:44.805,1,True,490
106580,5,Great Machine,"This tower comes with absolutely everything you need to get going with the exception of a monitor and a cable to connect the monitor. The correct model tower was shipped to me, however the video out ports weren't what I was expecting for this model, so I did end up needing to purchase an additional cable which is not the end of the world. The device I received came with 3 DisplayPort style ports, not 2 DisplayPort and 1 HDMI as I was expecting - I find DisplayPort to be a bit more secure and the cables more reliable (you can't just use and reuse and transfer them back and fourth to any old thing) so ultimately it was a nice little upgrade and a pleasant surprise. I also misunderstood what was meant by ""accessories"" and ended up buying a keyboard and mouse separately, so if you are wondering about the need to purchase those - you don't! In the box was also a WiFi adapter, as this particular model does not come equipped with WiFi capabilities out of the box. Setup and first-use went exactly as it should for a brand-new PC, and the drives appear to have been properly cleaned (wiped drive was overwritten to remove any trace of previously deleted data), so it essentially runs and behaves like a brand new out of the box PC.<br /><br />I bought this for the sole purpose of running Revit23, so far I have not had any performance issues or other problematic encounters with the device. Revit is the only software that has been installed or used on the computer, but it is extremely resource heavy - especially with larger designs or more intricate planning. I can't imagine there being any issues with moderate or even the heavier side of moderate usage short of a hardware failure or misuse. The WiFi adapter it came with is extremely reliable and hasn't given me any connection issues when I use it (I tend to keep the device offline 90% of the time). For reference, my office is in an upstairs bedroom, with the router on the first floor (9 foot ceilings) and roughly 40 feet of linear distance between the where the desk and router would be if they were on the same floor. I also have abysmal internet service and speeds much of the time. Take from that what you will.<br />Overall this would be a great daily driver, especially at this price point, and has the capability to carry some really resource consuming programs with ease.",[],B08K9CJL71,B08K9CJL71,AGVXH2UANCBQ4NH5R2Z7FAO7XWHA,2023-01-20 16:05:01.730,1,True,490
272889,4,Convenient solution for modern PCs,"With modern PCs rarely coming with disk readers anymore, old PC users like myself that liked to archive things on CD/DVD media still need a way to read our old disks, play CD music, and sometimes write to new blank disks. There are several portable disk readers and writers available to resolve this issue.<br /><br />This particular unit is very small and light and supports a current USB 3 interface (both type A and type C connectors) so it's a handy way to be able to give modern PCs a way to use that media. So far I've not had any issues; the player plugged in fine and was recognized by Windows 10 without any need to download drivers. I played music CDs, ripped a music CD, and read a photo disk. The drive isn't the fastest device but it was sufficient for my needs.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Supports both Type A and Type C connections.<br />- The interface cable is integrated into the unit. This is convenient as you're less likely to misplace a cable.<br />- Quiet<br />- Plays CD, DVD, and Blu-Ray disks<br />- Doesn't need an external power source, just runs off your PC's USB port<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Integrated interface cable is very short, just a couple inches. You'll have to keep the drive close to the device using it<br />- No included software, but you should be able to find free utilities if you want to burn disks, and Windows comes with the ability to rip music disks built-in<br /><br />Tips:<br />- If you don't need to use Blu-ray disks, step down to just a regular DVD reader/writer. It'll save you a bunch as there are plenty of those external drives and they are about half the price of a Blu-ray version<br />- This doesn't come with a carrying case. Some external drives do, so look around for other options if you plan to travel a lot with this and want something to help protect it<br /><br />I haven't tried the disk burning feature on this one yet, so I'll report back later if it warrants mention. Also, I've had disk readers burn out on me after a year or two of use, will report back if this one does the same thing.",[],B09N6TDYZB,B09N6XLBCG,AEDWL4WM4S5LO3IDXJO5M6I5DXTA,2023-02-26 19:58:27.516,2,True,490
874758,4,"Good fitness watch, Great price, Bad App","This watch is actually a very nice value for the cost. It seems well made and feels nice although a bit bulky. It has a bright display and about 100 various watch faces to choose from. Battery life seems great as I have been wearing it for three days at this point and it is still 50% charged.<br /><br />The package watch comes nicely boxed with a charging cable and 2 additional watch bands should you not like the one that comes with the watch. I choose to stick with the watchband that came with it and find it to be stylish and comfortable.<br /><br />The display shows the typical time and date but also shows your steps,  calories burned, and heart rate. The watch will also track your oxygen level and blood pressure which is fantastic for those looking to monitor health. I am not sure I would use the reading to replace those that you would get from a high-quality medical device (blood pressure cuff, oxygen meter) but the watch is certainly close enough to keep you informed on a consistent basis.<br /><br />The big letdown with this watch is the application. It really doesn't provide much in terms of data and while it does allow you to connect your watch and use it to make and receive calls, text, and other notifications, I am not sure that this is the best use of a watch. I use a good quality headset with noise cancellation and find that much more effective especially for business calls. The watch would certainly work in a pinch but if your phone is close then why not just use your phone as a phone?<br /><br />The next major disappointment with the app is that while it will connect to the google fit app, it doesn't seem to pass any health data to the app. Given that this is the case, the only thing you are doing by connecting to the Fit app is giving the watch manufacturer access to your Google files. My recommendation is not to do that.<br /><br />So, my overall opinion is that this is a really good option if you just want to track steps and heart rate and need to be able to do so inexpensively. It is a watch that provides most of the functionality of the much, much more expensive major brands and does so with style.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this watch if you looking for an inexpensive alternative to the major players who dominate the market.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jzG5xoSQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jzG5xoSQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jzG5xoSQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Cq36PBLLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Cq36PBLLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Cq36PBLLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81evNWJWX2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81evNWJWX2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81evNWJWX2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BXCH38QW,B0BXCH8R3D,AEFDJRC2R66OAE2MFKIZSM4MXPXQ,2023-04-25 15:38:32.327,0,False,490
278695,5,Bought two of them.,"My man and I love to game together. Our PC's were getting old but we didn't have a lot of money. I've worked with computers since I was 17 and I'm 40 now. So I do have quite a bit of experience.<br /><br />Gamers: Great for stuff like League of Legends, and I've been playing Path of Exile on it (lowered graphics) just fine. Seems to handle quite a bit despite it being integrated graphics. You can't play the new stuff with super graphics. But I don't have the dang money to buy those games anyways, so I won't be trying to play them. lol If you enjoy light gaming, this thing is perfect! Plenty of space too with the 500GB drive.<br /><br />Browsers/Show Watchers: If you just like browsing around and watching shows, then this thing is perfect for that! Great all-around mini pc!<br /><br />The things I like the most: Small and compact. No more moving a giant tower everywhere. Setup was extremely easy. Came with Windows 11 Pro. Runs all the games I play. Nice amount of RAM. I have been able to multitask without a hiccup. Example like I'm playing PoE, listening to music on Spotify, and then I look things up and keep tabbing in/out with my browser. Slower systems are gonna lag or even hiccup. But this one just keeps truckin. So it's pretty great for medium multitasking as well.<br /><br />Do you dislike anything about it? Well I know I can't play the newest games that have intense graphics, but that's a sacrifice you have to make if you can't afford your own dedicated graphics card in a big system. But honestly that's the only downside at all. And I'm cool with that, it does exactly what I need.<br /><br />I ended up enjoying this mini PC so much, that I have just gotten a second one for my guy. I freaking love  technology, and I LOVE what a powerhouse this lil thing is for the price. Super recommend. (Also don't get the cheaper mini PC's that are around 100-200 unless you are strictly browsing online and watching youtube, you can't game on those, I've bought one before, they're not strong enough for it.)",[],B09HCCVSJR,B09LD7KLGQ,AEUHVQLWMRU3GSD5MZCMQWNWNVXQ,2023-01-06 23:43:43.113,10,True,490
548916,5,Great value!,"I bought this on sale for $300 and liked it so much that I immediately ordered another!<br /><br />I have no comment regarding the installed Windows OS; when I buy a machine with that OS installed, I boot into an installer for an alternative OS (Linux in the past, OpenBSD for the past several years)<br /><br />The Mini PC package is pretty much identical in size and shape to an Intel NUC (which this unit replaced).<br /><br />Other reviewers have noted that the fan is quiet even under load. I confirm this: although I don't run game software, other CPU intensive software warms up the air exhausted at the back of the unit. The only way I've been able to discern fan noise (in a quiet room) is with my ear close to the vented top grille of the enclosure.<br /><br />Not only do I not run games, but I don't run a desktop environment (preferring an X11 window manager) or *any* GUI apps. I use lynx for the web, telescope for the ""small"" web, and alpine for IMAP/POP email. That said, I do run xlock or xview in the root window for decoration; my *impression* is that animations (particularly of busy xlock screens like that of the ""scooter"" mode) seem to render better than they did on the NUC that I ran previously.<br /><br />OpenBSD 7.2 installed without issue; everything works. (NOTE: this does not include the built-in Bluetooth, which is unsupported by OpenBSD regardless of the hardware platform. If you really need to run a Bluetooth speaker or headset, buy a USB Bluetooth dongle; OpenBSD supports these.<br /><br />This Mini PC has an AMI BIOS.<br /><br />Performance is fine. (Remember, I'm not running Windows. YMMV...) Subjectively, this Mini PC is every bit as snappy as my former Mini-ITX desktop build with an 8th-gen 65W TDP CPU from Intel. In fact, I think that my days of custom builds are in the past; Mini PCs are just too convenient and are available in a broad-enough range of configurations for my applications (software dev't, email, servers, etc.).",[],B09WVGVCNK,B0BB2KK9FL,AHWXCYQFQBYVLQJZT6PKAHVJ3TNA,2023-03-02 00:23:26.030,1,True,489
343181,4,Good router but with caveats,"The Good: It’s light and sits vertical which works for me. The user interface is terrific. You can really dig under the hood and see/learn what is happening. I live in an old home that makes reliable and as advertised by my provider speeds via Internet very difficult. I was shopping for a system that came from a trusted name and support that did not try to force a subscription model on me. After some struggle it runs well and even use their AIMesh with an ASUS Blue Cave device to help carry the signal throughout my home. Also, they have good customer support. The Wi-Fi signal is fast.<br /><br />The Bad: The firmware was not working for me. I had to deal with a few weeks of intermittent Internet and a lot of time with customer support resetting the station and tweaking the optimal and recommended settings with them. In the meantime the wired connections worked but that was only a handful of devices connected to my entertainment center.<br /><br />The Ugly: The culprit was the ASUS firmware. I had to think out of the box and install a third party firmware named Merlin (look it up) before every my Internet became reliable again.<br /><br />Additional tips:  If you have older devices like smart plugs and IOT appliances that use 2.4 GHz only, set up with separate 2.4 and 5.0 GHz channels. Do not use their Smart Connect because it’s truly not very smart.<br /><br />If your 2.4 GHz alone ever goes down (not even visible while the 5.0 and wired devices are ok) and restarting the device doesn’t bring it back, dig into the admin interface and change to any another channel and hit the Apply button. Wait a few minutes and your 2.4 GHz magically reappears and reconnects with all of your old 2.4 GHz devices. I have had to do this only a few times in 3 months and it’s probably because I live in an area with a lot of Internet traffic/other users nearby.<br /><br />Overall I am happier with this upgrade but unless you’re willing to spend a little time with a learning curve this might not be the best for you.

Good motion detection, perhaps just a bit too sensitive but that's something that can be adjusted through the VicoHome app. I'll write more about the app below. I tried both SD and HD quality but couldn't see any real difference in the recorded daylight when viewed on either my phone or tablet.<br />When set to higher motion detection sensitivity every car that drove by on my busy street 90 feet away triggered a recording. At night the b&w images are only good out to 20 feet or so.<br />The included mounting bracket is OK, seems sturdy enough though I have had trouble finding a good place to mount it on my house. That's my problem not the camera's though.<br />I have had it running outdoors for 24 hours and the camera still shows 99% battery. That's much better than expected.<br />I have Alexa in my home but have not found any way to pair the camera with Alexa. If it's possible it's not documented anyplace.<br />Now for the app:<br />PROS- It works and controls the camera well.Viewing the videos from the Internet is handy BUT that feature will only be available during the 30 day trial period. Watching videos recorded to an internal SD card is more cumbersome but it works.<br /><br />CONS-The camera sends your images to a server somewhere in China! I hate that! After the 30 day trial I expect that I'll start getting requests from China for a credit card to keep the service active. That's not going to happen.<br />The app really eats battery power on my Android phone. Most power hungry app I've ever installed.<br /><br />SUMMARY-<br />It's a plus that the camera can work with just an SD card and no subscription though without 100% functionality.  Will I mount this camera permanently? That remains to be seen. Will I keep it? Probably, because it's OK for what I paid for it and it's not worth the hassle to return it but I can imagine a time in the future when it just ends up unused  in a box with other failed high tech gadgets.

588011,4,"Sound is good, controls are cumbersome","This is my first time using any earfun product. I’ve actually never heard of this brand before. I did some research on the brand before ordering, and read multiple glowing reviews about this product from tech magazines. I had no problem getting these earbuds to fit and stay in my ears. I appreciate that included are 3 extra sets of tips for a custom fit. I mainly use earbuds while I work out at the gym. These buds stayed in place through a few sweaty workouts so far, no problem. I’m no audiophile by any means, but I think the sound quality on these earfuns is great. The sound is crisp, and while listening to high energy hip-hop at the gym, I particularly enjoyed the level of bass these provided. As far as noise cancelling goes, I had these in when I first got them and my husband called my name 3 or 4 times and I didn’t hear a thing. I didn’t know he was trying to get my attention until I looked his way and saw his mouth moving.<br />I haven’t used these buds on a phone or video call yet. I’m a little nervous to do so, because the control functions are super tedious to me. Maybe I’ll get used to them over time, but as of now, I need to look at the instruction manual to do anything like control the volume, pause, or skip to another song. Once I feel more comfortable with the controls maybe I’ll try these out on a call.<br /><br />I was able to connect these to Bluetooth and pair with my phone right away, through the Bluetooth setting on my iPhone. I haven’t downloaded the earfun app yet, that will be next. The earbuds themselves charge really quickly. I went for less than 10% charged to full charge in about 30 mins or so.<br /><br />For the price, these earbuds sound amazing, stay connected, cancel noise, fit In my ears and charge quickly. The sound quality definitely far surpasses that of my other well-known brand of earbuds. I’d recommend these, with one main caveat: the controls are really tedious.

522263,2,A few things that I wish I knew before I purchased,"My wife purchased these from Amazon from my Wishlist. I recently had a pair of wireless headphones that because of time and extensive use needed to be replaced.  I purchased these because of good reviews, but have not been impressed by a few of the qualities that I wish I would have known before I purchased them. To be clear, the sound quality is great and noise canceling is good. The compatibility make this product not useable in my scenario.<br /><br />First, you can not listen to the headphones and charge them at the same time. This is frustrating for me as I mainly use these headphones at work in front of my computer. I have to unplug them before I use them and remember to plug them in after I am done using them.  If I do not turn them off manually, or I don't remember to plug them in, they will be out of charge the next day, and because you can not use them while charging, they can not be used until sufficient charge has been reached rendering them useless.<br /><br />This leads to the second issue. I work on a Windows 11 machine, with a Bluetooth Dongle added. When you plug the headphones into a power source from an on state, the headphones automatically disconnect from the source. When you go to power the headphones back on, they do not automatically re connect when turned on. I have to manually remove the headphones from my Bluetooth settings, and re add them to be able to listen or use the mic, every day. I have a success rate of connecting the headphones to my bluetooth to my computer of about 50%.<br /><br />These headphones only do this on my computer (I have tested on two and it doesn't work on both), and not my mobile phone, so if you plan on switching devices frequently, or only use them for a mobile phone, then they would work. If you plan on using them at a computer these features make it incredibly frustrating, so much so I have gone back to my broken headphones.<br /><br /> I reached out to support and they told me that my computer must be incompatible with the headphones and that they could not do anything but offer me a 15% discount to purchase another set of headphones. I am extremally disappointed especially being unable to listen while charging, and having to re connect my headphones to my computer every time I charge my them.",[],B07NM3RSRQ,B08PFW1S1V,AHPH25OHPHQEMJJ2A23ZFDOYMLWQ,2023-03-21 19:46:01.476,0,False,489
61041,5,Impressive features that match many X670E motherboards.,"Received on January 27, 2023. Will update this review as needed.<br /><br />I am currently using this with my Ryzen R9 7900X and have not experienced any issues. It boosts properly and its performance is stable with CL30 memory clocked at 6000Mhz.<br /><br />It offers Gen5 PCIe and Gen5 m.2 so you can future proof your system if you ever intend to upgrade to a new GPU (current 40 and 7000 series GPUs are only Gen4 so don't worry about it for now). Likewise with the m.2 slots, it supports Gen5 so you can also upgrade your storage when needed.<br /><br />It is an 8 layer board with excellent power delivery so it's got your basic overclocking needs covered as well.<br /><br />Either this or the B650E AORUS MASTER which offers very similar features/specs at the same price point are great options, I highly recommend checking out the full specs of both and see which one offers what you want.<br /><br />Also remember this, motherboards will not really make much of a difference for gaming so you can avoid overspending on this to increase your budget elsewhere. Buy them based on the features you want and if you are an avid overclocker who wants the absolute best, you should probably look at the X670E boards instead.<br /><br />This board also has Clear and Reset CMOS options, which is an excellent feature if you ever mess up anything in the bios. You can always use that to go back to the base stable settings or install a fresh bios. It also has a Q-Code display for basic troubleshooting if your system is ever not booting properly.<br /><br />Keep in mind that you can only use 3x m.2 drives if you want PCIe Gen5 on the first PCIe slot. Using other PCIe slots may also lower the bandwidth to Gen4 on the first one depending on the amount of lanes used.<br /><br />Overall, with this board you are gonna get similar features to that of the mid-high X670E boards at a much lower price and not have any sort of performance issues, while at the same time, futureproofing your system so you can drop in a new gen5 GPU or gen5 m.2 storage in a few years.",[],B0BHMTC99Q,B0BHMTC99Q,AFSXJ4YL2P5ZTKCKXM7WG4MSJ36Q,2023-01-30 19:14:46.428,1,True,489
237841,3,it's a meh in my book. You Definitely get what you pay for.,"Well, it plugged in and powered up the device - so no complaints there.<br />The quality of the product is good with the respect the fit and finish is well executed.<br /><br />What I liked.<br />1. It works<br />2. All of the plug in connections are solid.<br />3. I like the indicator light on the power supply showing there's power to the transformer. This is something that's missing from the OEM HP power supply.  Personally, I think this is a really good thing!<br />4. Cable length is good at both ends - the power cord to the power supply and the cord coming out the other end that plugs into the computer.<br /><br />What I don't like<br />1. The plastic incasing the transformer is less than desirable - it's hard and brittle.  I can see a drop on a concrete floor would cause it to crack.<br />2. the cords are stiff out of the box - and isn't going to get better when cold.  I'm hoping its just the insulation, and the wire isn't aluminum, or copper coated alumimum crap.  My complaint stems around a pet peeve of mine.  computer cabling that retains the packing shape - making it a challenge to get to lay flat.<br />3. Like the HP version, the power cord from the wall to the power supply uses a somewhat non standard type of end, that I call Mickey Mouse or bunny ears (connection).  I'm sure there's a more technical name for it, but I have no idea what it is.  A standard PC power supply cord would be a more desirable choice of power cable.  Especially when I leave the power cord in a hotel somewhere; then try to find a replacement cable at my new location. It's a challenge - been there done that... Not fun. Especially when you've got a presentation the next day and 50% battery on the computer.  Anxiety inducing!!<br /><br />All in all it's OK especially for the price point.  It most certainly is not a direct replacement for the power supply that came with my HP ZBook - but it's also about 75% less money. So you get what you pay for.<br /><br />The materials are, in my mind, sub-par.  The cord is",[],B07SW89GC3,B07SW89GC3,AFH2JOWDXTR5PWJR3TUFDK3BLJRA,2023-02-05 21:22:34.114,1,True,489
235763,3,Waiting for 48 hours for support is for the birds,"While a lot of information is at the Blink.com website, I defy people new to Blink to actually FIND it.  And you certainly don't want to wait for 48 hours to get an answer on how to set up your camera, do you?  PLUS if your question is not specific enough expect to have to go back and ask again. This part of Blink really riles me. Even though Ring doesn't have the scheduling feature for camera on and off, at least they have decent support - probably wait in que for about 15 minutes at most.<br /><br />Got the camera. Set it up with the help of friends, NOT Amazon. So then I buy a outdoor motion light with camera. Once again LITTLE to no instructions other than set your camera up. BUT it doesn't tell you how to now have BOTH cameras on the same scheduler with different names AND different schedules and perimeters.  I know it's possible since I've seen friends that had front yard, back yard, etc. with their own schedules but I defy a new person to Blink to find HOW on the Blink site. I'm sure it's there but nothing I search on brings up what I'm looking for.<br /><br />I then tried to set up the motion light with camera on it's own scheduler.  They said, set up your camera, get the blue blinking light with a red light. I'll be damned if I can get a red light.  I try to just set up the camera and it says I already have a camera set up - true enough. This is the SECOND camera.  They also content that the motion lights will then be automatic. Don't know about that since it won't let me set up a second camera.  Do I now have to have two accounts?  WHY can't people provide DETAILED instructions 1) set up scheduler 1  2) set up camera 1 3) ADD a camera with motion lights  (do I really need a second scheduler?).<br /><br />I'll also mention that camera #1 (just a camera) is NOT good in the dark.

Purchased in Nov. 2020 as a christmas present for him.<br /><br />My family knew an ice storm was going to hit and I charged up all our power banks, phones, laptops and tablets so we can at least watch movies.  This was one of the items I had charged up and these were the experiences we had during that storm:<br />-my father told me it had drained his phones battery (chalked it up to my magnetic charger so I gave the device the benefit of the doubt)<br />-Cranking the lever in hopes to get the radio to play (hours of cranking but for a few minutes of radio so it was useless)<br />-I didnt bother using the solar panel as I was disappointed in this device and we used other things.  Pretty sure it was just a bad battery or something.<br /><br />-------------------After the storm, I forgot about this device-------------------------------<br />I found it again and remembered it had a radio function.  Started using this radio for our bird and he likes it.  Thought it could just serve a purpose and we could use AAAs to power it (at this point I had no hope for the battery after this amount of time).<br />I charged up some batteries and insert them into the device.  A few days later, thought I should see if they are still playing holiday music and turned it on.  Dead.  The batteries were already dead....... so guessing my unit was faulty or something.<br />Shame this cant be somewhat dependable for entertaining my bird....<br /><br />---------------------------------------------conclusion----------------------------------------<br />1.

538935,5,A LOT better than we ever expected.,"Amazon Glow was the device we never knew we wanted. We grew to love so much over the year plus we used it. We miss it terribly.<br /><br />With this device, our boys could call their cousins and grandparents on their own, and have daily meaningful interactions. They had a blast with all the games! We all loved how they would use the Glow to stay connected with family that was out of state. Sure we could use phone and video calls to stay in touch, but it was the casual nature of the interactions like, ""Hi Grandpa! Would you like to play a game?"" that really made this platform shine!<br /><br />The games were innovative, and the interfaces were really clever! How the Glow allowed them to see each other while playing on a shared gameboard was truly unique. A small video window wasn't fighting for screen space, and the ""touchscreen"" was so large and intuitive.<br /><br />Other than long distance interactions, the Glow allowed brothers to play fun and challenging games with one another. One would get the Glow, and the other would get a tablet. This worked beautifully! They could play in different rooms, or at the same table. They were both entertained and played [relatively] peacefully with one another regularly. There were so many games! And new titles were ALWAYS being released! This was a unique platform that really provided truly unique opportunities.<br /><br />We've used Osmo for years, and while that is a great platform for educational games, etc., but it is completely different from the Glow. The Glow allowed for real communication and connections, whereas Osmo is designed primarily for a single user at a single location.<br /><br />There really isn't anything out there like the Glow for the regular consumer. I mean, sure, we could set up (2) devices, one for an online connected game, and another for a video call, but then you need two devices each, and getting all the connections to work reliably and consistently would be a bit of a pain and possibly a game of luck. Having everything in one consolidated and effective device made it so easy.<br /><br />If they didn't wish to be the steward of this platform, for whatever reason, we wish Amazon would allow another private firm buy the technology and keep it going.

928347,5,Airplane mode saves power,"First, I want to clear up some confusion about airplane mode. Looking at reviews, I see complaints about battery life and the assumption airplane mode uses power. Wrong! Airplane mode means wireless communication is OFF. When you drive a car, the overdrive off light comes ON to tell you that feature is OFF. On a Kindle or phone or any device with airplane mode, that means the WiFi and bluetooth are OFF. (With a phone that also turns off cellular communication.)<br /><br />My previous Kindle  was/ is the paperwhite 8th edition. That Kindle recently started having problems like light not coming on, random restarts. So I bought this to replace my old PW before it quit working. This rest of this review is comparing this 11 gen vs 8 gen.<br />This new model automatically puts books of same series into a folder. My 8gen simply showed all books in library. While reading there is an option to have a clock at top of screen, and time left to finish book at bottom. Time left is calculated from your reading speed. The adjustable light may be nice for some people, but for me I have it set to look like my old Kindle. There is a low power sleep option (device options, advanced). With this option enabled it takes a few seconds to wake up and use. I disabled that feature so I start reading when I want to. I have a third party ebook that takes about half a minute for 8gen to process, this new Kindle takes about 6 seconds. To transfer my content I plugged both Kindles into my PC. Both Kindles came up as external drives. I found the folders where content is stored, then copy and pasted. That is also how I load PDF and other third party content. My old kindle was bought December 2014 and got a lot of use. Battery life on old Kindle is still good, and I always use airplane mode except when downloading a new book.<br /><br />Overall, this feels like a waste of money if old Kindle were reliable. The new features are not worth it otherwise. I was worried the smaller border would make it difficult to hold without touching the screen, but I have not had a problem. The border can be widened to reduce accidental touching. I am using my new Kindle with CoBak case. The one new feature i really like is the bigger screen with more text.",[],B08KTZ8249,B09F7TGV1H,AFUS7MI5NZIBG4AOC4O3SE7MLH5A,2023-05-03 16:18:54.116,24,True,489
451668,5,Great bluetooth adapter!,"When I first received this, I wasn't sure exactly how it could possibly work. How would you be able to pair with a device if this doesn't have a screen?<br /><br />I guess, it was easier than I thought, from pairing mode, turn the speaker you want to connect to it on to pairing mode, and they just connect to each other. It was pretty simple.<br /><br />Using it as a bluetooth receiver, it works great! Connect to it just like any other bluetooth speaker and it works exactly as you would expected.<br /><br />As a nice bonus, it has TOSLink connectors for input and output.<br /><br />They are nice enough to include a 3.5mm audio cable, a 3.5mm to rca adapter, a TOSLink cable, and a microUSB cable in the box.<br /><br />For testing, I connected it to my computer speakers. I think I'm going to end up leaving it here!<br /><br />I can now use my logitech desktop computer speakers over bluetooth! Works great!<br /><br />I also tested bluetooth transmission to a bluetooth speaker. It transmitted my computer audio to the speaker quite easily.<br /><br />Only downside that I don't like: It needs to be ""on"" for the bypass mode to work. The bypass mode allows you to connect the input directly to the output, so that you don't ""lose"" an existing connection by using this.<br /><br />In bypass mode my computer speakers are directly connected to my speakers.<br /><br />In rx mode, it turns my computer speakers into bluetooth speakers.<br /><br />In tx mode, it adds bluetooth audio to my desktop, in hardware! No software bluetooth glitches!<br /><br />Overall, this is a great little device that does exactly what it says it will do.<br /><br />There is a light on the top that indicates it is ""off"" that is a battery ""icon"" but there does not appear to be a battery inside of this. A little bit of a strange design choice, but it doesn't change anything.

335954,5,Fantastic amp at a very reasonable price,"Based on numerous favorable reviews on YouTube, I bought this amp. The amp definitely lived up to the hype: it sounds amazing!<br /><br />Douk Audio also manufactures the Aiyima T9 amp. The two amps are identical except for the name on the amp. Douk says they give priority to fixing issues on the units that bear the company name, so any issues mentioned in reviews for the Aiyima T9 are addressed first in the ST-01. Having seen the reviews for the T9, I can confirm that none of the issues mentioned by the reviewers showed up in my ST-01. In particular, there is no clicking noise, no problems with the remote, and no Bluetooth pairing issues.<br /><br />The unit is solidly built with a sturdy metal chassis, quality knobs with no play or wiggle, and excellent inputs on the rear of the unit. I ran signals through the Bluetooth, RCA and USB inputs, and everything I ran through them sounded great.<br /><br />The stock tubes sound really good, but I upgraded to the GE JAN 5654 tubes for a noticeable improvement. (See my separate review for these tubes.)<br /><br />A couple of things to keep in mind:<br /><br />* When powering on the unit, there's a scratching sound that lasts for 1-2 seconds and then goes away. I believe this is just the sound of the tubes lighting up. Again, the sound goes away almost immediately.<br />* The VU meter's needle  might not move very much if the input signal is low. For example, if you're playing your iPhone through the Bluetooth connection, the VU meter needle barely moves unless the phone is fully cranked.<br />* Tip: Follow this suggestion when using the knob to turn the amp on and off: Press quickly to turn on the amp. Press and hold to turn off the amp. If you press and hold to turn on the amp, nothing happens. If you press quickly to turn off the amp, the input changes. When using the remote to turn on or off, no need to worry about quick or long press.<br /><br />In summary, this is an excellent amp, especially at this reasonable price. Highly recommended.<br /><br />(If you found my review helpful, please answer Yes below.)",[],B09FPTJ6XD,B0BSXR3DLW,AH3WQZCPXLJ4SVLFJWQ2YNRPR7IA,2023-02-11 22:25:45.062,7,True,489
6205,5,Turning Head,"The Aomeisi 2K Security Camera is a 3MP 2.4G Wi-Fi security camera that is powered by a USB adapter. The power cord is a little over eight and a half feet long. That should be enough to feed the cord inside the house . It offers both cloud storage or local storage to a micro SD card. It can accept up to 128 GB cards.  Be aware that if you choose to record to an SD card and the camera is outside, your SD card is also outside with the camera.  The camera is PTZ, which means pan, tilt, zoom.  The phone app allows you to rotate and tilt the camera, view live and recorded video, use it as an intercom, sound a siren and many other functions. The picture quality is pretty good and you can zoom the image 4X on your phone. You can also change the resolution through the app. This does affect how much storage is used for recordings. But the highest quality allows you to see better detail when you zoom in on a detail. I included a photo where I show the camera on the left, the resolution is set to QHD, which is the highest, there is a stuffed character 4'6"" from the camera, the camera is zoomed all the way in on the character and the image is displaying on the phone in the rights side of the photo.  This gives you some idea of the detail it is possible to achieve with this camera.<br />  It also has night vision which is surprisingly clear. You can also set alerts up on your phone when it detects motion, but that was too much interruption for me.<br />  The setup instructions are fairly straightforward, but some of the English is not translated well. I have to say they really tried to be complete and have mercy on folks with less than perfect vision. The booklet itself is 48 pages and the font is big and easy to read. There are lots of screen shots. And the App on your phone also can access ""Quick Guide 1"" which is 9 pages and ""Quick Guide 2"" which is 7 pages. So most of the instructions are right there on your phone. The process is simply following some prompts (many of which are full English voice prompts), scanning a few QR codes and enabling certain access to your phone resources.<br />  I think this security camera offers a lot of functionality for the price","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QAabvyAGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QAabvyAGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QAabvyAGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fmD7YjmvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fmD7YjmvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fmD7YjmvL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nHENiiT+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nHENiiT+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nHENiiT+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-WyKpX5+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-WyKpX5+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-WyKpX5+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71U2Xp0LCIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71U2Xp0LCIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71U2Xp0LCIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UzMYVeJtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UzMYVeJtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UzMYVeJtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YqwoxOWwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YqwoxOWwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YqwoxOWwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BQQTWXLY,B0BX6NQPSP,AHSAG5P74AQM3WDZZUHZC4JZNSVQ,2023-01-30 04:39:52.474,0,False,489
295634,5,Amazing!!!,"At first, I was going to give this a four star rating because I was having connectivity issues but after some trial and error and experimenting I finally found a way of setting it up, so so that there are very little to no connectivity issues. (in case anyone with this system is interested once I plugged the LAN cable directly into the box all of the cutting out) Once I got that out of the way, the sound quality is absolutely unbelievable! It’s not just loud, but the clarity and different layers of sound that you can hear out of the speakers are unlike anything I’ve ever heard before! The only thing that could compare is the theater, the room I have my set up in is about 20 x 20 with flat walls in the acoustics are unbelievable so I would say it’s even better than the theater.<br /><br />True home theater surround sound! I got the better subwoofer that they recommend and there is truly more sound and base that could come out of the speakers that I would want. The maximum I’ve ever turned it up to us about 67 out of 100. It just blows my mind that they could go so loud. I do not have the use of a center speaker, so I was worried about voice clarity not coming through. Just the speakers by themselves do not need a center speaker at all, no matter what the volume is the voice clarity of any show, sports, or movie is perfectly very easy to hear. My last sound bar sounded great, but I cannot make out the voices unless I had subtitles which is very inconvenient.<br /><br />The only other thing I could possibly think of as a negative is the fact that you cannot control the volume of each speaker individually, which really is unnecessary if you’re sitting directly in the center of the room. But I am not sitting in the center of the room, my is just slightly to the left of center and there are some adjustments that you can make, but I can’t quite get it just right. Maybe with some updates down the road that might be a possibility but for now it’s still MUCH MUCH better than any sound bar or home theater surroundsound system I’ve ever owned, and I’ve owned several of the top-of-the-line home theater, surround sound systems, and nothing even comes close!!!",[],B099Z93KL7,B09GSS396M,AFMQJYNKID6CAPUHWOGPALZ2N7GA,2023-01-24 21:18:46.325,1,True,489
856472,5,How to review perfection?,"I have been in search of the prefect IEM for a long time now, even giving up on the format for a while. My first real foray into the IEM world was with the ATH-CKW1000ANV and they were where I found the sound I was looking for but it had numerous issues and led to the JVC HA-FXZ200 and these were exceptional but required using the tipple flange tips to get a great seal and the bass that would dig into the basement. After looking at a ton of reviews I made a major investment into the FIIO fh7... and was thoroughly disappointed. While a technically accurate headphone it was not one I got much enjoyment out of as it became sibilant at moderate volumes. In short they were not the headphone for me despite being the flagship at the time. Looking back I should have picked up the FH5 as it seems to have the musicality I am looking for. So buyers remorse is kicking in hard but FIIO throughs me a bone and announces that there is yet a higher end model coming and I do my best *shut up and take my money* and picked these up on launch day.... The presentation is lovely and everything feels like money well spent. The interchangeable 1/8"" 2.2mm and 4.4mm are a boon and must be praised. And speaking on the cable I give it full marks it looks lovely and feels good in the hand.<br /><br />On to sound. These are it. This is what music should sound like to me when I put these on with no eq or trickery. They rock and crank up without any hint of sharpness or overdrive. One of my favorite test tracks is Finks live troubles what you are in. In this you get an acoustic performance that you can hear the strings plucked while the acoustic bass guitar vibrates your eardrums but never gets muddled and the box drum is clear.

455830,2,Not durable,"I have owned many Bluetooth headphones of this style, and this set has begun to deteriorate much more quickly than the others.  I can typically expect around 12 months of good use out of most of them, with some surprising me and lasting a few months longer than that.  Typical failure mode is broken internal connections causing intermittent or total sounds loss in one or both sides.  It seems to be a general flaw in the design across the board.  However, this set has already started to show signs of malfunction within just 3 months.  While wearing them, slight movements will cause the sound/signal to cut out or sound staticky.  This is the normal precursor to failure of sound in one side.  It's a sign that there is an internal connection coming loose, and movement can break/reestablish the connection.<br /><br />Generally speaking these were not that great even when they worked.  The sound quality, range, and battery life are all about average.  It also suffers the same design flaw as all others of this style where the charging port cover gets in the way of the charging cable.<br /><br />The biggest annoyance is the significant delay in ""long press"" functionality.  Most of the headsets I have owned have had the same setup for long press, where it takes between half a second and 3/4 of a second for the headset to register the long press and send the command.  However, this set takes about twice as long, somewhere between 1 and 1.5 seconds.  If you are trying to fast-forward through a song or podcast or something, it's totally useless. Repeated long press commands take excruciatingly long.  I almost always end up stopping what I'm doing, taking my phone out, and using the UI commands on the phone instead.  It's a hassle, but way less of a hassle than trying to use the long press feature on this headset.<br /><br />The one feature that I really loved was how quiet the button clicks are.  Most headsets make a very loud clicking noise when you press the buttons, but this headset is very quiet.  I really like that feature, and it's a hard feature to shop for or find in other products.<br /><br />All in all, even if this hadn't started to break down so quickly, I would not consider buying them again.",[],B0BGLDJTKW,B0BGLDJTKW,AEXRNDGYD5L3YLHBCONH46W7N4HA,2023-03-28 16:47:06.605,0,True,489
301065,5,Best $99 I’ve Spent,"I’ve been looking to upgrade my iBasso DC06 which I recently learned was a duo ESS Saber DAC.  It actually sounds amazing with my LCD-XC, but then I don’t want to bring those to work with me.  So, I’ve been using my modified Audeze Sine - I replaced the ear pads to over ear pads as well as the stock cable.  So when I came across the Hiby FD3 and saw that it had duo ES9028Q2Ms for under a hundred dollars, I knew this might be worth a try<br /><br />It’s a lot smaller than I thought and machined out of a single block aluminum from the looks of it.  Perfect for hooking up to my iPad Pro when I travel.  Unfortunately, my go to audio cable wouldn’t work.  Bummer.  I tried other cables, but you need to use a Apple certified mfi cable.  The DAC needs it.  Not the iPad.  So, I used the supplied USB C to USB C cable.  It’s nice and short which is perfect if you’re using a laptop, but not an iPad that sits on a Magic Keyboard or a magnetic stand<br /><br />I’ll have to look around for a longer Apple mfi cable to remedy this<br /><br />Short comings aside, the cable is fairly good albeit a tad short for my purposes.  My LCD-XC didn’t sound great, but not bad either.  However, my Audeze Sine sounded amazing!  It’s what they call synergy and it’s perfect!  At least for me.  Wonderful clarity without harshness.  Nice timbre.  Digs low.  And the best part is the seperation!  Instruments are just layered and fully in their own space, much more than my LCD-XC which surprised me.  My search for the perfect traveling DAC is finally over….sort of<br /><br />One thing I noticed is that the FD3 seems a bit power hungry.  I don’t use it for prolonged periods so it may not be a problem in the long run.  But for now, I’m happy as a clam",[],B09YLJD1ZR,B0BZNW37WN,AH6A5QMPIJH72CT7PYBDBZOQE7JA,2023-01-01 21:51:26.924,1,True,489
989483,5,Pitaka iPad Pro MagEZ Folio 2 offers some unique design features,"I've been using Pitaka cases for my iPhones for years, and consider them the best in the industry. The new MagEZ Folio 2 iPad Cover shows promise of being in the same league. It is well-engineered, has a fine fit & finish, and is highly functional.<br /><br />Design:<br /><br />It is easy to compare this to previous Origami-style cover for iPads or Kindles, but this has a number of significant differences. The design is simple and uncomplicated, unlike competing brands that have very involved folds and reticulations: the Pitaka has just four panels. Its camera cut-out will fit older iPad models that have a single camera lens or more modern ones that have three camera lenses.<br /><br />Materials:<br /><br />Inside is a soft microfiber surface that will not scratch the back or glass of the iPad. The outside cover is a polyurethane material that is not only sturdy and well built but has a leather-like surface that makes it easy to hold without that common slippery feel. The strong magnets hold the iPad securely in place.<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />The iPad enclosures you buy are usually divided into three styles: covers, cases, and keyboard combinations. Unique among cover-style iPad holders like this one: an Apple Pencil strap to hold it in securely. Without the Apple Pencil attached, it will keep the cover secure from accidentally opening. The cover provides instant-on/instant-off capabilities, expected of magnetic covers; the strap adds additional safety. There are four configurations of this cover for common uses of an iPad: 34° tilt for drawing or typing, 53° tilt for landscape streaming, 57° tilt for Facetime calls, and 62° tilt for portrait document reading.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Well designed<br />- Quality material<br />- Highly functional<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- This is a nitpick: The QR code on the paper wrapping over the package shipping content does not take the user to the YouTube video for this product but to other Pitaka cover videos. But you don't need it, the wrapping has pictures to show you all the features.",[],B0BX3Q6P8V,B0BYZM5V9P,AGFQ25TP5PAQ2EV55NB4OX5WSQBQ,2023-04-11 22:22:56.780,0,True,489
361853,4,"Nice, light bag for tech essentials, but rather pricey","I use this bag to transport a Surface Book and a 15.6"" USB monitor. It holds them both, reasonably well protected, with just barely enough extra room for the Surface power supply, a few pens, and accoutrements such as cable and a slide clicker. That pretty much exhausts its room. It's not very thick front to back.<br /><br />It makes up for that by not adding much weight. If you're trying to lighten your load as you carry your computer, this is a pretty good option. The pockets are sufficient for the sort of things you'll probably carry. The front has two zippered pockets, but no internal organization in either one (no pen loops or subpockets for things like business cards). When it arrived, that section also held the shoulder strap. The back has a snap pocket which is ideal for boarding passes, stowing a phone during airport security, etc. The photos for the product don't show that, so I included a picture of it.<br /><br />The internal zippered section has two subsections. One is well padded and my Surface Book fits nicely there. The other is a bit wider, and holds my 15.6"" monitor. That section also has a couple of subpockets, about 6""x8"".<br /><br />You'll probably need to install the shoulder strap, because this bag is missing one feature I would expect on a high end bag: a fixed strap on the back that fits over luggage handles. Since the bag is narrow and the bottom isn't particularly flat, it doesn't balance easily on top of a wheeled luggage piece.<br /><br />Without that feature, and all things considered, I consider it somewhat pricey. It's in the territory of high-end designer bags, but it doesn't really fit in that league. The new version of my older Kenneth Cole polyester bag, for example, is significantly lower in price, while having more high-end features.<br /><br />I won't be able to assess durability for awhile, but it seems sturdy and well put together. The ballistic nylon seems tough enough to last, I think. So I expect to use it for a while.<br /><br />If weight is your primary concern, and you are sticking to the tech basics when you travel, this might be what you want.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71q-zv-4rjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71q-zv-4rjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71q-zv-4rjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BGM4KPDV,B0BGM4KPDV,AENOKU4HH372XPJXWFKLM6USBXVA,2023-01-21 17:55:10.839,0,False,489
223989,3,If you want a billboard in your bedroom…,"About eight months ago, the Echo Show 5 was on sale, so I decided it might be nice to replace some of my Echo Dots with Shows.  I mostly thought it would be cool to have a device that does everything an Echo does and also displays the time.  I was so naive.  As many others have commented, the Show’s display cycles continuously among a variety of suggestions, sponsored ads and other…b.s.  If you go into settings and disable every last one of the “home screen content” types as well as “rotate continuously,” this reduces but does not eliminate such things from displaying periodically.<br /><br />Also—and I should’ve seen this coming but didn’t—on an Echo device with a screen, every time you tell it to do anything, the screen changes to reflect your command; if you say, “Echo, turn on light,” the Show displays the light’s status for a brief period.  And of course if you tell it to play audio of any kind (e.g., radio or your music provider), it displays what’s playing; then if you want to see what time it is, you have to say, “Echo, home.”  Maybe that seems logical, but on the other hand, if, for example, I’m *hearing* NPR, I don’t need to *see* a screen telling me that NPR is playing.<br /><br />On top of that, the Show 5 is very poor at doing the one essential Echo function—hearing.  Similar to the experience of other commenters, I can be five feet from a Show 5, face it and say a command, and the Echo Dot located 20 feet away in another room will respond.<br /><br />I’m sure many people aren’t bothered by the display issues, but they really bug me.  Just not what I had in mind.  Between that and the failure-to-respond issue, within a couple of months I wondered how long it might be before I unplugged the Shows and put back my Echo Dots.  Well, that finally began yesterday.  I’m looking forward to a restored sense of visual peace in the rooms in my home ;)",[],B08J8FFJ8H,B08XVF418R,AE5FHCRT3FIBTXCWJQZ4YT4ZPBNA,2023-02-23 18:44:08.904,5,True,489
316341,5,Huge improvement over a wired Android Auto connection,"I have a 2018 Subaru Legacy and no matter what cable I used, my AA either wouldn't connect or would disconnect often at the slightest tug or movement of the cable.  I've wanted a wireless adapter like this and have been extremely happy so far.  The device itself is a lot smaller than I thought it was from the pictures.  It's about the size of a coaster and extremely light.  It comes with a usb-a to usb-c and a usb-c to usb-c cable, so you have options depending on your car's inputs.  Be mindful that the cables are short, but if you are plugging it in and tucking it into a compartment, it's fine.  You never have to really unplug this device or access it, so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />First time connecting it, the device needs to be connected to your phone via BT.  It shows up as smartboxXXXX and pretty much after that, your phone should connect within a minute or so of entering the car.  Make sure you aren't connecting to your car's BT.  It's not instantaneous as others have said, as the device presumably is booting up when the car powers on... but for me, the time it would take to remove my phone from a pocket, connect it to the USB cable and then have it load up... its not much different.  The big win here is that I haven't had it disconnect at all while driving.  I can put my phone anywhere, even leave it in my pocket and the AA stays on.  Be mindful if you have 2 primary drivers and you both BT connect to the device, when you both get in the car, one of your phones will connect to it first.  You'd have to ""disconnect"" from the device and my assumption is that the other will then connect.<br /><br />Updating the device was a little clunky, but following the instructions I did figure that part out within about 10 mins or so.  I don't anticipate doing that often, as they say if its working not to worry about it.  Customer Service is phenomenal.  They emailed me within 24 hours of placing the order, and I joked that I hadn't even received it yet.  I did write back to them about updating, and they send me detailed directions with pictures.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515Ol-JF8nL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515Ol-JF8nL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515Ol-JF8nL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N8CnobH8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N8CnobH8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N8CnobH8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BG13YFT4,B0CG8J2X6X,AGBRVIR6L5SYMYEMBG6W62GELRSA,2023-02-17 13:01:47.057,1,True,489
939479,2,Might be 4 start if didn't advertise as Auto Wake/Sleep,"This is a good looking case. Fit is fine. Though ""stand"" is different than the kind which folds in 3 pieces to form a triangle, it does work and might even be better than the 3-fold kind because you get a bit more choice in angle.  The surface you angle the bottom against is grippy enough to keep the ipad tilted up at several different angles.<br /><br />The two biggest problems are:<br />1) it claims to have a feature it does NOT have - the Auto Wake/Sleep when cover shuts.  There is not even the slightest bit of magnetic charge ANY where.<br />2) if you write to inquire, though the company, Aippdo, responded VERY quickly, and seems to want to do the right thing, they just don't express themselves well enough in English to really be able to provide good support.<br /><br />I'll paste in my communications with them below: My recommendation is to pass on this if you care about the auto wake/sleep function:<br />My question:<br />This beautiful cover does not have the wake/sleep functionality that the title and description describe. The display does not wake up or go to sleep the cover doesn't have even a hint of magnetic attraction to hold it closed.<br />I would love a replacement if someone could assure me that they are going to get me one where they are SURE this functionality works. From the reviews it seems many others say it doesn't work but some say it does so maybe you just have a quality assurance problem and I got a bad one.

261917,5,Use on the Nikkor 200mm f/4 Micro ED Lens,"I am very pleased with the way that this diffuses the flash for Macro (Micro) photography--very simple and easy to use, and gets great results!  I really like it, for getting great soft lighting that looks quite natural and beautiful.<br />This did not fit the 62mm threaded UV filter (65mm outside diameter) that I keep on the front of my Nikkor (Nikon) 200mm Micro ED lens--too small for the diffuser to grip it.  It works fine on the barrel/focus ring of the lens, which is 76mm (or 3"" OD.)  And to angle it forward (which I prefer,) works well--to have the front of the opening of the diffuser grabbing the top of the UV filter, and the back of the opening grabbing the focus ring.  The trouble with having it gripping the focus ring, (which is the majority of the front end of the lens,) is that the diffuser rotates with the focus ring, and has to be adjusted back to where it belongs.  When it is angled forward, it doesn't take much force to keep it from rotating with the focus ring, but is a hassle.  The filter on my lens doesn't rotate or move with focusing, (when I manually rotate the focus ring.)  My solution was to put a little piece of adhesive-backed velcro at the top of the opening of the diffuser, and the other part of the velcro threaded into the UV filter, (I left the wax paper adhesive backing on it, and caught the overhanging wax paper into the filter threads.)  That way it is easy to remove the diffuser when I don't want to use it, and it holds the diffuser from rotating as I manually focus.<br />BTW, on my Tokina 100mm ATX Pro macro lens, this fits fine on the focus ring, (75mm, and with the same rotation problem, and being back from the front of the lens as I do a close-focus,) but doesn't fit on the front of the lens, which is 65mm OD, (55mm filter threads... nor the extended barrel, which is 58mm.)  To use this diffuser on my Tokina, I would use step-up rings, and maybe a 72mm UV filter for the diffuser to have a level surface to grab onto.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61M1bTsaY5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61M1bTsaY5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61M1bTsaY5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07W3S6GJW,B07W3S6GJW,AEPSD2NHX24RWMRYSMXCGYMHJYIQ,2023-04-16 20:26:34.899,0,True,489
958183,4,Almost perfect…ALMOST,"This hub stand is a versatile and convenient docking station that offers a range of useful features. With the 11 different ports, including HDMI 4K 60Hz, 1000M Ethernet, 100W PD, USB-C and 2 USB-A 5Gbps data ports, it provides plenty of options for connecting your devices.  I used it with my Samsung Galaxy Note 20 (using DeX), my HP work laptop, my budget Acer laptop and an older Windows 10 tablet that I kept around.  It worked very well with all of them.  The tablet was a little laggy, but it’s older, with a USB 3.0 port (I used an adapter) and only 2GB of RAM.  Still, even with the under-powered tablet it was usable.<br /><br />One of the standouts features of this hub is its phone holder, which makes it easy to keep your phone or smaller tablet within reach while you work. The holder is adjustable and can accommodate a variety of phone sizes, making it a great addition to any workspace.  I didn’t (and wouldn’t recommend) use the stand part with my laptops.<br /><br />The HDMI 4K 60Hz output is another highlight of this hub. Using a variety of devices, I still found the picture quality to be excellent. The ethernet port is also a nice feature for those who need a reliable and fast internet connection, though I only tested this once for functionality as our home is pretty much entirely wireless.<br /><br />However, one drawback of this hub is that it doesn't come with a power cable at its price point. This was a bit disappointing, as I had to purchase a separate adapter to supply overall power to the unit. It would have been nice if the manufacturer had included a cable to make it a more complete package, particularly at this price point.  Still, I think the belief is that you’ll just use your USB-C laptop adapter (assuming you have one and that it’s USB-C).<br /><br />Overall, the USB C Hub Stand is a great choice for anyone looking for a versatile and convenient docking station. It offers a wide range of useful ports and features, including a phone holder and HDMI 4K 60Hz output. The only downside is the lack of a power cable at its price point.",[],B0BWSXMNBM,B0BWSXMNBM,AF4TBDNKDHW3Q5S57A7NC5NRQDLQ,2023-05-02 00:50:02.380,1,False,489
541548,4,A Quality Mid-Range Webcam,"There are typically a couple national brands I look for when I consider a webcam, but when I stumbled across this  webcam I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />This webcam by GUSGU is a 1920x1080p High Def Cam that offers a beauty touch ring light, noise reduction microphone, built-in privacy cover, and is compatible with most major video apps including the ones I primarily use - Zoom, Facebook, and Teams. At this price-point, I was expecting a more mid-range experience and that's largely what the camera delivered. While you can definitely get better HD experiences, you're typically going to pay more for that experience.<br /><br />While the webcam comes with a noise reduction microphone, I found the microphone to be the webcam's weakest point. While it's likely fine for conference calls or conversations, it's not what I would consider to be recording quality in any way. While most podcasters wouldn't dream of using a webcam microphone for a podcast, even entry-level recordings will likely sound a bit inferior here. This is true even when compared to similarly priced webcams from other brands.<br /><br />On the flip side, I'm a fan of the beauty touch ring light. It's a nice feature and it works quite well here. It added a nice quality to my webcam experience. I live in a rather dark house and this really improved the quality of my video.<br /><br />I was happy with video quality. I'll admit my needs tend to be rather basic. I would say, however, that even with this being an HD cam the quality wasn't that much higher than my several years old HP webcam. However, it is an improvement and I'm still overall pleased.<br /><br />This webcam weighs about eight-ounces and is fairly easy to move around. It has a pretty solid base and I had no glitches with any of the video formats I tried.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this is a good but not great webcam. It's likely just fine for everyday use, however, those looking to do more professional video work may want to explore upper-range options. As I haven't had this camera for a long time, I can't speak to durability but I will definitely update my review if that becomes a concern.

241319,5,Easy to use; works well for many applications!,"Summary: Good general purpose walkie talkies. Range is enough for typical use cases. The included rechargeable batteries have good longevity. Worth it, in my opinion.<br /><br />I like their bright colors. The neon green and orange in particular are hard to lose. I've dropped the orange one twice and had no problem finding it.<br /><br />These were very handy on an open campsite. It makes it quick and easy to reach family and friends without the need for a cell phone. In an area where cell signal can be hit or miss, these are a great replacement.<br /><br />I've also used these on residential job sites as an easy way to coordinate wire pulls. They haven't had any issues with the signal dropping out across large homes, even if one is in a crawlspace or other enclosed space.<br /><br />They're handy in airsoft as well. They have a simple interface so when I hand one to a new person they quickly know how to use it. It's easy to set them up and get going. I haven't had any issues with the range in a moderately wooded area over about a mile and a half. One of the radios sometimes gets more feedback than the others.<br /><br />The battery life is good, a bit above what you'd expect. The rechargeable batteries are much appreciated; you'd be eating up a lot of AA batteries with each of these walkie-talkies taking three batteries at a time. And the charging port isn't some special or proprietary port; it's a normal micro USB (OTG) connection. This is the one before USB C started being used for all smartphones, so you probably have an old phone charger laying around that would work.<br /><br />The included lanyards have a quick disconnect feature that was cool at first but seemed like a weakness when in use. The plastic quick-disconnect feels like it would break easily. Ultimately I preferred the clips as it keeps the radio at the ready and not flopping around when walking.<br /><br />At the time of writing this review, the price of these walkie talkies was $59.49 including a 15% coupon. I think that price is good for what you're getting.

This RVP+ was almost the perfect solution but alas, it has at least one issue that I can’t get over.<br /><br />Here’s what I like and don’t like about this USB hub:<br /><br />****************************************************<br />LIKES<br /><br />*Multiple Connections- This hub includes multiple connection ports for almost every accessory I can think of. It has two HDMI ports so I can plug in both of my monitors, a network port which I can run directly to my router, and multiple USB and USBC inputs for all of my accessories. All that goes through a single USB-C cable into the back of my laptop so it's nice and streamlined.<br /><br />*Small Profile- this has a really small footprint so it doesn't take up a lot of space on my desk.<br /><br />*Power Option- I like that this thing includes an additional USB-C port that accepts a power input so I can still charge my laptop while I'm using it.<br /><br />*Simple Setup- everything was plug and play on this hub with no setup or additional software required. I didn't need to install any drivers and everything was automatically recognized as soon as I plug it into the hub.<br /><br />****************************************************<br />DISLIKES<br /><br />*Missing Monitor After Sleep- My only pet peeve with this hub is the fact that it seems to disconnect a monitor after going to sleep. Once my computer goes to sleep and I wake it back up, only one of my two monitors comes back up, no matter how long I wait. In order to get the second monitor to show back up I need to unplug it and plug it back in.

747403,5,Amazing paired! Jazz & electro rock bliss!,"[[VIDEOID:e50a8d626073f767b23ef78a0ddd0212]] Be sure to not have mono selected in your settings for stereo vs mono. There is a setting in Bluetooth that supposedly adjusts levels better for headphones vs. speakers as well. Theses things are great for the money and I expect them to bloom nicely with time. Stereo is the way to go for big room sound with these relatively small speakers. Pocket size, yet it fills up your large pockets for creative wearables. These have a well balanced sound and can get loud if needed. EQing is typically needed with any small speakers at higher levels. These can pass a bass heavy if placed in corners but are not quite sub levels. I bet these would be outstanding with a small sub for a bedroom  to small studio entry level applications for people on a budget. Don’t underestimate a bunch of these hooked up with Alexa’s and a Alexa sub for whole home entry level yet deeper applications. It’s quality budget solutions of all kinds, like for office listening or therapeutic centers. These in stereophonic mode is where they will shine rather than mono applications. Theses are clean speakers so far with just a weekend amount of use. These have a full sound even at 50% levels without a EQ applied. These also sound pretty good at lower levels and with all kinds of different music or vocal listening. Fantastic for traveling and wanting a broad stereo sound field at a easy no brainer price. These are impressive for newcomers as well as for audiophiles if hooked up correctly. Can’t wait to try a vacuum tube preamp setup with a sub for the experience. These are fun speakers because they are easy to carry, yet loud enough to turn heads:<br /><br />Get them before they Jack the price up! There that good just listening to Latin jazz and dub techno sounds amazing so far at moderate levels, it’s bathroom filling or any room I’m sure. Excellent Clean sound way above it’s asking price so, & not everything is meant to be cranked even though it can especially in closed quarters,.

417418,4,For cloning and hard drive access,"Docking stations like The Wavlink Dual Bay Docking Station help me do TWO things easier and faster: duplicate existing drives and access drives not in an external casing (like hard drives removed from laptops and desktop machines) with an existing computer using an external USB interface.<br /><br />GENERAL OPERATIONS: A power supply plus into a standard receptible and into the back of the red unit.  There is an external on/off switch on the back of the unit which is important: the hard drives I have were formally the internal units of desktop and laptop machines with an active operating system. When connected to my computer, I want the computer to run off the op system on the hard drive inside my computer. So I let it boot up before turning on the Wavlink unit.<br /><br />The area for inserting the hard drives can handle my 2.5 inch and 3.5inch hard drives. It takes more than a few tries to get that larger hard drive seated correctly which was a little frustrating but not unexpected. I got it eventually.<br /><br />The connection on the back of the Wavlink is the old-style square USB connecter that printers and other accessories used when USB was first introduced.<br /><br />This unit states USB3 to Sata BUT I've never seen a USB3 speed from a unit using the square USB connector. I believe you can interface with the USB3  using an adaptor but you will end up with USB 1 speeds when connected through USB to a computer.<br /><br />Compact and fits easily next to the computer.<br /><br />ACCESSING HARD DRIVES<br />Both hard drives plugged in were recognized and files accessible IF the drives were valid. I was able to transfer files to and from the hard drives, the purpose for which I wanted the unit. I tried an SSD drive and nothing showed. To be fair, I also couldn't access it or have it recognized through internal desktop connections either.<br /><br />HARD DRIVE DUPLICATION<br />I was not able to test this function.<br /><br />EVALUATION<br />For what I was able to test, this is a reasonable but not especially fast connection for a computer.

129513,4,Excellent bundle of joy!,"Update 03-21-2023: When I went to register this camera with Canon I found out that even though it is an American model number (T8i vs 850D or Kiss...) it is still considered ""Grey Market"" and was sold from a non-authorized retailer. Because of this, it can not be registered with Canon. It also does not have any warranty protection from Canon. We did buy the extended warranty that Amazon offered, upon purchase, so it doesn't really matter to us, but it might matter to others. We still really like the camera and have had no problems with it, so far. Just want to give others a heads up on what to expect.<br /><br /> When we ordered this Canon EOS Rebel T8i camera bundle and there were no reviews. There was one spot in the item description that I didn’t see until after I ordered it that mentioned the camera was the “import model” and I didn’t want that.  So I was nervous about what I would get. I took a chance and I am so glad I did. I received an actual T8i not the import model 850D. The amount of items that came in this kit is incredible. It will take me forever to learn how to use them. Everything seems to be good to great quality with the exception of the tripod. That feels lightweight, but chincy. It would be good if you were hiking or doing a ton of walking with it and wanted something easy to carry. It did come with a carrying backpack type bag. Over all I am very happy with this bundle.<br /><br />I was also happy with the size of the T8i. The talk all over the internet is how much better the  mirrorless cameras are and that they can be made smaller than DSLR cameras. This Rebel is the perfect size. I was afraid it was going to be a monster the way everyone talked about DSLR cameras, but it isn’t. I don’t know how you would handle a camera smaller with a big telephoto lens on it.  I know this might not be the most up and coming camera, but I prefer DSLRs to the mirrorless fad that is happening now. They are tried and true and been around for decades. Can’t wait to learn how to use my new camera.",[],B0BSG7PDVC,B0BSG7PDVC,AEIICDTRN6PVTNKJJZBCIS6IGGMQ,2023-02-20 05:51:13.035,0,True,489
176671,1,"Literally worse than the A12 at everything, including radiator fan","What is the point of these fans?<br /><br />These are high static pressure fans, meaning they are good for radiators and bad for case fans. Yet these perform worse than the NF-A12 at both, even when restricted to the F12's lower RPM of 1500. These F12's perform slightly better at incredibly low (sub-500) RPM's but gets outclassed as soon as the RPM's ramp up. Not to mention the A12's also go to a higher RPM so they work even better if you're okay with the increased noise. If your case can fit 30mm width fans you can even get the T30's that are better than even the A12's.<br /><br />So what's the point of these? Noctua themselves sell a fan that beats these in every category for the same price. These are old, outdated fan designs and Noctua's newer A12's just left these in the dust and then the T30's left all Noctua fans in the dust right after.<br /><br />These were the cause of massive temps in my Dan H2O. Specifically, both my NVME drives (with heatsinks) were hitting 83c and my 4090 was thermal throttling at 83c constantly, even with a 70% power limit. In a small case like the H2O, a lot of the stagnant heat from the GPU is expected to be carried away by the radiator fans, but these just weren't up to the task. I swapped to the T30's and immediately lost 15c on my nvme drives and my GPU doesn't go pats 75c at 70% power. This test was done over a 3 hour gaming session btw, not just surface level tests. I have much lower 53c idle temps on my 7700x as well and at 90w limit I max out at 75c. My CPU temps went down slightly, they weren't much worse with the F12's, but all of my other parts dropped by ~10c.<br /><br />These are just a nonsensical buy. I wish I knew that before wasting $50 on a pair and being outside the return window. I don't even know what to do with these. My advice is to either get A12's like everyone else, or better yet T30's if you can fit them.",[],B07654PNFQ,B07654PNFQ,AF23TYX3FCGHLAHRTRFATZNEBEZA,2023-04-01 05:01:14.851,0,True,489
5132,2,"Bright picture, but fails in several other areas","At first glance, this is a nice package with positives such as, included projector screen and built in Bluetooth.  The included screen is nice, the picture is bright, the built in speakers work fairly well, and it's not too noisy for this price of projector at about 45 dB.  So what's the problem?  There's 4 for me that really disappoint.<br />1.  The first one I quickly found was adjusting the screen size.  Depending on how far the projector is placed from the projected surface, the size of the picture changes.  These projectors have a feature that allow you to adjust the picture size so you don't have to physically move the projector back and forth.  This has that feature, but it requires you to go into a menu to adjust the size percentage.  Unfortunately, you cannot see the results of the percentage change without backing out of menus and going into others.  As you adjust the percentage, the screen size does not change.  Exiting to the main screen, nothing has changed either.  This change has no impact on the main home screen.  The only way to see if the percentage you selected is correct is to basically start watching a movie, which requires a few clicks through the menus.  This is frustrating and inefficient.<br />2.  The second thing, and likely the biggest issue, is you cannot focus the entire screen.  You can get one area focused, say the center, but as you move away from the center everything becomes out of focus.<br />3.  Thirdly, this does not work with all portable USB drives.  It worked with an older Western Digital drive, but not a newer Seagate drive.  I verified that both worked on another, older, projector I own.<br />4.  No case included.  This is not a problem or an issue, but it would have been nice to include a case for this price.<br /><br />The picture quality is decent, the colors are good, and the picture is bright, but I cannot recommend this projector due to the above mentioned issues.  The biggest issue is probably the focus.  When watching movies it's not too noticeable if you try to average out the focus across the screen.  However, if you're using this projector for something like PowerPoint presentations, then it's unusable as you cannot focus text very well.",[],B0C2HQQCB8,B0C2HQQCB8,AGXW2PVCZ5UWBOC3D6BGQ4GIXYXA,2023-05-12 03:13:56.348,1,False,489
79984,4,Just fine for my use,"Purchased this unit for my 2004 Silverado.  Had no issues installing it and was happy the wire color codes were the same as my adapter.  Helped speed up the install.  Fit into a standard car stereo opening with ease (had chevy face adapter from older CD stereo).  Operation was a different story.<br /><br />The unit has a display that is always active.  If playing a MP3 it wants to scroll the song data continuously.  If you press clock it will stay there unless you press forward/backward then back to scrolling.  I find this irritating.  It wont just show you the song number or time, has to give the folder name it found the song in ""ROOT"" followed by MP3 name.  Also requires FAT32 where my other Chevy radio's work with NTFS.  Not major deal breaker there.  I did have some MP3's that were glitchy when playing, changing to another MP3 and back made it play correctly (software issue?)  The volume using good speakers is very sufficient for the truck (I also have a small 8"" sub). While the volume is good there is no default volume so if your MP3's are weak and you turn it up to compensate and then return to the radio you can be blasted out of the truck.  Bluetooth does work, connect my phone with ease and streamed music without issue.  Then upon returning to the vehicle it was no longer connected and required me to reconnect the phone.  Bit aggravating there.  I have not tried any of the speaker phone/voice capabilities.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price (considered in this review)<br />Easy Install (about as easy as you can get)<br />Wires properly color coded<br />Good power to speakers<br />Does play from a FAT32 file system<br />FM and AM Reception was very good!<br /><br />Cons:<br />Volume does not compensate for the input (watch out)<br />Some minor issues so far with some MP3's files<br />Bluetooth required reconnecting upon return to vehicle (not automatic)<br />Display continually scrolling data<br />Not NTFS comnpatable<br /><br />Overall, considering the price and performance, a good deal.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Aw3hlNAIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Aw3hlNAIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Aw3hlNAIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00T3QBROA,B08P39QZJK,AFYOIF4Z6OEUAEP6OL64JQ3VHOMA,2023-03-23 20:17:15.204,0,True,489
718787,5,I love these headphones,"These headphones really have exceeded my expectations.  What I like about them is that they fit over and in my ear well, have great sound, and the case shows actual battery life.<br /><br />The fit is nice, although not perfect.  I have small ears, so I've been looking for headphones that will fit snugly into my ear and not fall out easily.  These headphones fit that bill.  The over-the-ear part is soft and not too tight (I would actually say very loose), so it doesn't push against the back of my ear and cause any discomfort.  For me, it's just enough to do the job it was designed for.  Inside the ear, it's not perfect.  I do feel a little discomfort after wearing them for a while, but not enough that would make me hate them.  I can adjust them from time to time to relieve the little discomfort there is.<br /><br />As for the sound quality, I would say it's really good.  It has a good range from the treble to the bass.  I adjusted my phone's equalizer to see how the sound quality pairs against the different options and I like what I hear.  The bass hits deep enough for headphones, better than others I have used.  The treble is good and helps balance out the bass in the music.  I was impressed by the sound quality of these headphones.<br /><br />The case is a little bigger than other headphone cases, but not overbearingly big.  If you were to carry it in your pocket, it would be noticeable.  What I love about the case though, is that it displays an actual number to show the battery life.  You don't have to guess based on some lines, you know when it needs to be recharged.  When you place the headphones in their ""pocket"" within the case, they fall right into place.  With other headphone cases, you sometimes have to adjust the headphones in position to charge correctly.<br /><br />All in all, I do love these headphones!  They have good battery life, in the headphones and the case, so they will last a long time.  I have been using mine, on average, a couple of hours a day and I've had them for 4 days now.

633814,3,Not worth the amount it selling for,"The frame arrive within two days. They shipped it without a cover box. It was shipped in the regular frame box. Just like you buy out the store. It came with the frame , remote control with batteries, extra frame (brown), warranty card, cable, wall mount, stand with screws, jump drive with preload stuff, and power cord. A person has to download SSA Wi-Fi Frame App. This app is easy to download but some what hard to figure out. You have to use the remote control to do anything dealing with the frame. Hate that it’s not touch screen. It would go much quicker and easier if it was. Trust me I know. I have a 10.1 digit frame. I had a hard time getting my hometown setup on the frame. It was a huge problem with getting my wifi to stay connected to it. I just use my hotspot from my cellphone to connect to the frame. Finally get account from phone and frame connected together it was a task uploading pictures. The app sometimes won’t send the pictures to the frame. It only load 50 pictures at one time. Some pictures I had to try three to four times. After working with the setting in how you want the pictures to scroll and how fast you want them to come and go; it was okay. This frame again isn’t touch screen, not motion sensor, it won’t allow you to zoom on one picture. It will zoom all the pictures. You can change the angles on the screen. However, you can’t crop any pictures. All in all it’s can be a headache and still I wasn’t satisfied with the settings of the frame. My 10.1 $159 did more than the 21.5 $299 frame. The most things I love about this frame is it’s big, has the ability to play music with or without the pictures, you got an alert, and calendar. The calendar screen is beautiful. So if you want something that feel like a dinosaur and make you work to put pictures on it and love using the remote than this frame is for you. Time is what you will need to use this frame.

58257,3,My 4 year review,"I’ve been using this strap for for years now & on two different cameras.  It’s made very sturdily, but in my opinion too much so as I’ll describe. A few revisions could & should be made by Peak Design, especially at this price point.  When I first got this strap I would‘ve quickly given it 5 stars, but after a few years of use it pretty much annoys me every time I use it.<br /><br />I like the width of the strap & it’s a very good material (similar to a seatbelt, but not as wide). The anchor tags need to be longer because when the strap is installed, its overly bulky clips interfere too much with camera operation.  Granted I have XL hands, but I’ve read this same critique from others as well. Even without the strap installed, the anchor tags always flop around & get in my way way too. The non-slip material that rests behind your neck is unfortunately on the outside of the strap as you wear it, so it’s basically useless unless you enjoy the feeling of a twisted strap. I certainly don’t, & I think it is the stupidest idea Peak Design has developed with this strap.<br /><br />Speaking of a twisted strap, it somehow seems to always be oriented incorrectly when it’s not on your body.  Set it on a table and the anchors twist the wrong way. Put it in your camera bag & it never lays down well.  On that note, when I place my camera in its bag the anchor connectors & adjustment buckles always want to lay right on top of my rear LCD screen. I have a screen protector, but that’s beside the point bc I don’t want it getting scratched up by my strap of all things.  Trying to place the strap any other way in the bag is more cumbersome than it should be due to the stiffness of all of the components.<br /><br />So what do I like about the strap? Adjustability.  The adjustability is great. Literally everything else has a drawback & is annoying.  I will say though, Peak Design is very close to perfection with this strap. Resolve the issues above & it certainly would be the perfect camera strap & worth the $60 price tag.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GubZDsBbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GubZDsBbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GubZDsBbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0781QV3H4,B0781QV3H4,AEU3CTLHMLDCIQUU5YAY3YCGXRXA,2023-02-04 00:53:14.205,0,False,488
590369,4,Comfortable and Adjustable,"I needed a side handle to add some comfort to my camera rig. I chose this one from SmallRig due to the versatility of its ambidextrous design and the low weight and high durability of carbon fiber.<br /><br />As far as side handles and grips go, this thing is beautiful; the magnesium alloy and carbon fiber construction looks and feels premium, and will blend nicely with any rig, whether it cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.<br /><br />The handle fits great in the hand -- while it's not as ergonomic as some dedicated left or right handles, comfort does not suffer due to its dual-use design; its size should be good for average and large hands alike, but it may feel a bit bulky for people with smaller hands. Even with extended use, I have not had an issue with it becoming slippery as other reviewers have noted. Since I have only used it indoors in a climate-controlled environment, I decided to replicate the potential sweat of more demanding use by misting some water onto my hand; with moisture introduced, the handle does become a bit slick, and I can see how it would be a problem for heavier rigs. Since I'm not a professional photographer/videographer (and I'm not prone to having sweaty palms), sweat is unlikely to ever be a big issue for me, and if it ever is, the handle can be wiped dry with a cloth (or even my shirt if nothing else is available). I also would have no problem temporarily wrapping a black rubber band around the handle for added grip.<br /><br />The 360-degree adjustment works beautifully, and there are no detents -- you can rotate the handle to the precise position you need. The NATO interfaces (both the rail to rig and handle to rail) are rock solid. Another reviewer described the fit as ""sloppy,"" but I suspect that's a problem with the rig rather than the handle, since I can't replicate the issue with my equipment.<br /><br />I think the reduced grip in sweaty conditions was an oversight on SmallRig's part, and something as simple as a removable rubberized overgrip may have been a great benefit for those that will be using the grip in outdoor/hot environments. As for me and my amateur indoor use, the grip is near-perfect and I'm glad to have it in my arsenal.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PXpriqtCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PXpriqtCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PXpriqtCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XO4IfOBFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XO4IfOBFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XO4IfOBFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YtoF1CdCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YtoF1CdCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YtoF1CdCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lqDDIDu0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lqDDIDu0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lqDDIDu0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719d9qpTeuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719d9qpTeuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719d9qpTeuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QPNlZh3GL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QPNlZh3GL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QPNlZh3GL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BHNVYBN2,B0BHNVYBN2,AGBDC6QTSUHLREWSZWKFWPSEHIRQ,2023-01-09 19:59:37.027,0,False,488
905107,4,Amazing microscope for beginners / class,"[[VIDEOID:a391ddd9a86a918ae0b763c248790713]] I'm quite surprised as to the good quality of this microscope for the price. I was expecting a bit less but pleased with what was received. The body is cast, heavy and solid, no toque issues during focus. The stage is also solidly built, if it's plastic it doesn't feel like it, it feels like metal with a powder coating or something. The stage clip could use a bit of work but it holds the slides in place well enough. All adjustments, stage and focus (coarse and fine) are well built and offer smooth movement. The condenser and aperture surprised me on this one, again for the price range I really assumed they would have skimped on the quality here but they actually pulled through and included some decent hardware that offers good lighting distribution and contrast adjustments. The LED itself, however, could use some work as the brightness levels aren't the best. Obviously it can dim down to off, but it doesn't seem to want to get bright enough when the aperture is closed all the way for higher contrast, it could use a bit more brightness, especially if using the 100/1.25 objective lens.<br />The video in this review shows the blood sample provided with the microscope at 3 stages, recorded with my phone with the included phone mount atop the 2x & 25x lenses. The 1st part is 4/0.1 (200x), 2nd part is with 10/0.25 (500x), and 3rd / final part is with the 40/0.65 (2,000x).<br />The phone mount is cheap plastic and wobbles around on the eyepiece, but locks to the phone quite well and offers adequate adjustments for your phone camera lens placement.<br />Power supply is via a USB plug but the microscope itself doesn't have a USB plug (see picture of plug type). Power output of provided adapter states it's 1,000mA, so 1 amp, so keep that in mind in case you plan on using this with a USB power bank. Possible as long as it can output enough current.<br />No broken or missing parts and overall very pleased. This will provide an amazing learning experience for the kids, with adult supervision and guidance. Highly recommend for any young aspiring scientists out there.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51E-TMZVB0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51E-TMZVB0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51E-TMZVB0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XWl0yCOjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XWl0yCOjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XWl0yCOjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jXXcGc6YL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jXXcGc6YL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jXXcGc6YL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BJD4X9Q5,B0BGVWTXX8,AHEUJXVYJJITHRFHG62SSEA73M7Q,2023-03-11 02:09:24.067,1,False,488
276945,5,Light it up!,"I haven't done much underwater video or stills work, mostly because I'm not much of a diver. But we have trips coming up where not only will we be in the water, a waterproof light will be helpful.<br /><br />My son-in-law worked with me to test it out and he was surprised how bright it was compared to the OEM light.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- BRIGHT! This little thing puts out some light.<br />- Nicely made, just feels sturdy. The accessories are mostly plastic but there is a lot of metal (aluminum alloy) in the construction of the light itself, plastic only where it really needs to be.<br />- Comes with everything you need to attach it and your GoPro to the also included mount. And a cold shoe adapter if you want to use it on a stand or DSLR. Love that flexibility to use it in or out of the water!<br />- Three different light modes. Each with two levels of brightness. Easy to switch between modes.<br />- easily available USB charging, cable included.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Well, my son in law and I may disagree on this. He thinks maybe it's heaviness relative to the OEM light is a con, I think it's not ""that"" heavy and in the water that's a pro. You're not going to feel the weight in the water, it may even help with stability (need to test that out still!) and the extra brightness over the OEM makes the extra weight worth it. You'll have to decide for yourself as to whether that's a pro or con for you.<br /><br />This light is definitely waterproof although my test of that has been limited to the bathtub. (Don't ask. THAT test was NOT with my son in law.) As much as I like reviewing products for other Amazon shoppers I don't love y'all enough to test it in the ocean during winter.<br /><br />I'm not a super techie person, I review based on how I use things and what's important to me in that use. If you want to know lumens, etc., they're in the product description.<br /><br />I'm happy with this light and will be packing it with me on my upcoming trips.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4161GOeM3CL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4161GOeM3CL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4161GOeM3CL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41BVwnMN8nL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41BVwnMN8nL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41BVwnMN8nL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B098NVS428,B098NVS428,AE75KU2SJTDINUHLN6RV5KUKK7XQ,2023-01-29 02:55:33.657,0,False,488
580568,4,"I got these primarily for my cats, and…","[[VIDEOID:9fc3a9f8ef3e8a20c415efa9d032b8a4]] So, I got this mainly for one of my cats who seems to be the only one that loves to be outside all day. I’m definitely a little over protective cat mom, I don’t like to let my cat out without a leash because you just never know. BUT I’ve had my cat escape a harness twice and has darted outside while someone was opening the door several times. Being so, I wanted something that just in case he wanted to get loose, I can locate him easily. The AirTag is okay. Here’s what I do like about it: makes a sound to help you find it, trackable using the iPhone, real-time location when nearby, a better sense of safety. Here’s what I don’t like: at night, it will tell me that I need more light to locate him, “more light required.”. He can be somewhere in my neighborhood or a couple houses down, but even that close most of the time his location will not show. It primarily only shows the location when my phone is in range (I would say it’s the range of a normal sized house, which is the 30ft listed on the AirTag specs), when I’m gone it will update but sometimes it won’t update for hours, you can only add the AirTag to one iPhone/iCloud account, and the biggest con is that it won’t locate him while he’s moving (it will sometimes only show approximately how many feet he’s away while he’s moving, IF within the 30ft) I added a screen recorded video of the AirTag in “Find” mode, with this review so you can see with that looks like. With all that being said; a lot of other reviews for trackers say that it’s not accurate or updated real time either. I do feel safer that he has the AirTag on. I would recommend as maybe an extra security BUT NOT TO BE RELIED ON COMPLETELY for pets! If you just want this for items being misplaced in your own home or rental location then this would be 100% spot on and most definitely recommend.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-jtHHJvcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-jtHHJvcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-jtHHJvcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510OJh52ZbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510OJh52ZbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510OJh52ZbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511sr+DYAmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511sr+DYAmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511sr+DYAmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51qAbiWS5HL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51qAbiWS5HL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51qAbiWS5HL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Iwu08Ev-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Iwu08Ev-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Iwu08Ev-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Z7LWFgmkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Z7LWFgmkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Z7LWFgmkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0932QJ2JZ,B0BVY5RHRR,AEIAG45TTABXJ27MHCHMQZQZLJXQ,2023-01-20 14:58:41.882,34,True,488
648535,5,"Once again, another great find in the Tozo lineup of wireless earbuds","My family owns almost every model of Tozo earbuds, along with the newest addition, a Bluetooth wireless portable speaker (Amazing speaker I highly recommend).<br /><br />We all have our favorite models, mine is still the T10s, our young adult daughter who has really really small ears has struggled to find one's that work for her until we discovered the A3, my husband has two different models he uses throughout the day(I'll try to update later with his exact model #s). I'm still keeping my first purchase many years ago, the T6 in regular rotation as well(I love the size of it's case)<br /><br />As you can see, we didn't really need another pair, but here we are now trying to decide who gets to keep this pair. I didn't expect to like the larger size of the external part, but I found it very comfortable and it feels more secure than even my favorite T10s. I feel they're a netter fit for times when I'm being very active,  like hiking, gardening, etc... It took me a minute to play around with the settings and learn how they function, but once I did, I realozed I really like this model.<br /><br />I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the Tozo models. My husband has his preference for the model he uses to watch movies and listen to music on, and he has a model he prefers to use for talking on the phone on his commute home and for work(a noise canceling model). He feels these NC9 are versatile enough he could use them for everything. I like having a pair that are noise canceling. I now see why my husband likes his other noise canceling pair so well.<br /><br />I think these would be a pair I would also buy as a gift. I feel like they tick a lot of boxes and most people would really like them. Don't be thrown off my the larger external design, unless you have really small ears that even the T6s/T10s won't work for you like our daughter's situation. These do not work for her small ears. She cannot get them to stay in at all due to the external size & shape(go for A3 if you have this issue or are buying for a younger person).",[],B0B4VZYGBR,B0BMXMNG7G,AGIKT3PRFPI5BODN47SSK2DNBYSA,2023-02-20 21:19:18.394,0,True,488
556940,1,It keeps your computer awake; but there are issues,"The Vcnoeo Mouse jiggler does what it says it will do. It appears sturdy and well built. This USB device will keep your curser moving (more than you want) and will keep your computer awake. Install it into a USB port, and push and hold the the small button for a second or two to turn it on.  A very small blue light on the device shows that it is on. I like the fact that there is an on-off button. There are three settings: random movement over a small area, random movement over a large area, and very small jittery movement. You can cycle thru these by pushing the on-off button. I think the movement is two fast and if someone looks at your monitor they will see your curser jumping around quickly. Other units that I have had have very small movements every few seconds, and you can still use your computer and do work with the jiggler active. Because the movements are so large with this unit, you need to push the small button  and turn it off each time you want to get back to work. It is inconvenient to  remember to turn on or off this unit when you need your computer to stay awake; and to search to see where it left my curser. So overall, I do not like the way this unit functions.  If an IT Dept was searching to see if employees are using mouse jigglers, any competent IT Department would discover this unit. The product description states that it installs as: USB Composite Device.  However, it installed on my computer as: TEST MOSUE. Yes, mouse is spelled MOSUE when installed. If my IT Dept searched my computer for installed devices, they would wonder what a test mosue is, and look into the matter further. First, the device would be questioned because it is a test unit, and then they would question the validity of the unit because the device type is spelled incorrectly. This would prompt my IT Dept to inspect my computer to determine what is connected to it.  If you can get over the stated problems, this device may be for you. However, there are too many issues with this product for me to like it. If the curser movements were slowed down to once every few seconds, and if the identification of the device was corrected to MOUSE, then this product would be useable.",[],B0BNB6ZJPK,B0BTXYC438,AFKNPUZO7UILDQMXVB2FM6S45D2A,2023-01-01 17:02:07.331,0,False,488
734927,4,The included “extras” make these inexpensive glasses worthwhile.,"Hi.  I have a variety of bird feeders set up in my backyard and my family enjoys using binoculars to watch the birds who visit. The binoculars we use most often (and keep “quick grab” handy in a kitchen cabinet above the fridge) include 8x30mm and 8x42mm compacts.  Adding this pair of high(er) pair of 12x glasses to the group has been positive experience and there is much to like about them.  The following is a quick take on what I’ve learned about them so far …<br /><br />  * The kit I received arrived with no visible defects to the binoculars, the included soft sided nylon case, mini-tripod or the phone-to-eyepiece holder and bracket;<br />  * The included mini-tripod, although mostly plastic, has an easy to adjust metal ball head and is, overall, surprisingly well made.  It scores extra points for having “press to adjust” sliders on each leg with detents and easy to read adjustment measurement lines.  The tripod attaches to the front of the binocular’s center column quickly, and without fuss.  It is a surprisingly nice little ‘pod …<br />  * The “eyepiece to phone camera” attachment is/was a fun thing to play with for a bit.  It was, however, a novelty that, at my house, went back into the box soon after it was tried; and, lastly;<br />  * These binoculars have contours molded into the body that help to make them secure to grip and comfortable to hold.  Once adjusted for the user, they focus quickly and are easy to control for 12x glasses.  They exhibit far less noticeable (hand)shake than I anticipated for their magnification power.  Sharpness, resolution, and image color is on par for their price.  Simply put, these are inexpensive, but decent, optics that do the job.<br /><br />The verdict:  These are capable binoculars that are packaged with a surprisingly nice little tabletop tripod, an eyepiece to cellphone bracket, and a sturdy nylon case with strap.  This value priced package is currently being offered on Amazon at a sale price that makes them even more attractive.",[],B0BNW5Z2SY,B0BNW5Z2SY,AERRLESDRTYSFMGSH76IYQ55UXGQ,2023-02-19 19:45:05.932,0,False,488
390897,5,My favorite IPad accessory !!,"[[VIDEOID:e4f3ddd722a370815c521c2de754314b]] I’ve had this protector about four months now and all I can say is…. GET IT!!<br /><br />Overall, this protector has exceeded my expectations and I love it. I didn’t want to commit to a paperlike screen protector for two main reasons, cost and permanence. The name brand paperlike screen protectors are expensive! Also, I didn’t want to commit to a grainy screen because I enjoy watching things on my iPad. I didn’t want to sacrifice my visual quality just for drawing purposes. While considering these two main things, I stumbled upon this protector. It has a low cost and it’s not permanent?? Sign me up. So I took the chance on this item considering there aren’t many reviews. The magnet is strong and stays in place for drawing. The texture is just like paper and has the resistance. I enjoy the ease of popping this on when I want to draw and taking it off to watch videos. This is also very easy to take around and travel with. I have a magnetic iPad case which allows me to attach it to the IPad case and put it in my bag with me ready to go. I really do love this product.<br /><br />So about the downsides: Although it’s called a screen protector, is not meant to actually protect your screen. Considering it’s a magnet, it will more than likely not protect your screen. This is meant for a paperlike feel only. Also, due to it being a paperlike feel, it does wear down your Apple Pencil nib. This problem is not exclusive to this product considering all the brands that carry paperfeel protectors have this issue. So after about four months of consistent usage, I will soon need to purchase a pack of replacement nibs. (Which can be found here on Amazon for about $11). My only other issue is that this gets dirty quite fast. It picks up cat hairs and lint easily. HOWEVER, this screen protector comes with a cleaning cloth so just be sure to stay up on keeping it clean.<br /><br />Overall: For the price and the quality of this product, this an amazing steal.

97032,5,This is the bag,"Hi.  I am a backpack addict.  I have about 10 backpacks more or less and not counting the sling bag I recently got.  My go-to bag is my eBags Professional Slim.  It's a 9/10 but it doesn't have space if I want to take off my hoodie. It's not designed to do that.  I have eBags motherlode carry-on that works well with the slim but I am not taking it with me when I go to Europe and Asia in three weeks.  So I need something that looks good, I can put it on my back but also carry a change of clothes if I want to be fresh when I land.  I reviewed a lot of bags of 40L type and a lot of them are about half the price of this bag but I have the Tomtoc sling and love it so it only made sense for me to get the big brother. It arrived today in style.  I was impressed with the inner box, sleeve, and tags.  I immediately took everything out of the eBags Slim and started to fill the Tomtoc.  Obviously, the change of clothes for the 14-hour flight will wait but my MacBook Air fit snugly and the zippered pouch for the cables and plugs was a no-brainer.  There are two zippered areas, one on the top and one on the front.  The one on the top was for my EDC flashlight, gum, toothpicks, wipes, and sanitizer.  The front zippered area holds my passports and an EDC multi-tool.  I struggled to find a place for my pens, extra batteries, USB C adapters, and such. I haven't found the right spot or perhaps it doesn't exist, ( I hope that's not the case ) If there's a small inside pocket or small zippered pouch inside, it would be ideal for such things.  The backup plan would be to use a small ziplock bag for those things and keep them in the front zippered pouch near the passports.  We depart in three weeks and return in 9, I'll provide an update then but super impressed with everything.  One more thing, a lot of the other bags at half the price have their brand name plastered on the front and I just didn't want that.",[],B097P4JVP7,B097P4JVP7,AGAFCDMHILIDPUJBANLRYY27QCIA,2023-03-27 04:05:28.034,4,True,488
481537,5,Airpods vs Sony WF-1000XM4,"I'm not an audiophile, but I was looking for great sound, noise cancellation, and fit. I got these Airpods which are my first ever and was impressed with the noise cancellation right away.<br /><br />Sound-I bought the Sony's (WF-1000XM4) second for one main reason, SOUND! I have the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones which are amazing. The Sony earbuds sound very close to the headphones. The Airpods didn't quite have the same sound although they sound great. I was actually surprised that the Airpods sounded very close to a pair of Mpow M30 earbuds that I got in 2020 for $30. The Sony's seem a bit louder with richer sound. Also, the Sony buds have the ability to change the sound profile using the equalizer app. The Airpods rank second to Sony in my opinion.<br /><br />Noise cancellation- Both Sony and Airpods do an amazing job, but I think the Airpods beat out the Sony but a hair. The noise cancellation does not disappoint on either one.<br /><br />Fit- The Airpods are way more comfortable for my small ears. The Sony feel big and like they are going to pop out. I find both comfortable, but the Airpods feel more natural in my ears. The Sony's take a little getting use to.<br /><br />Controls- I prefer the Sony controls. The Airpod controls still feel a little awkward to me. Matter of preference.<br /><br />Voice/Calls- LOVE the Airpods!!! I haven't tried the Sony's on calls yet simply because I automatically go for my Airpods. They connect quicker. The calls are clean like the person is in the room with you.<br /><br />Battery Life- Airpods lasted a bit longer.<br /><br />Overall, if you mainly make calls or workout, I would go with the Airpods. If you are looking more for music listening, then the Sony's are way better. Noise cancellation...either one, but because of the better fit of the Airpods on small ears, I would default to the Airpods...although the Sony headphones beat out both.

It performs very well with vocals and mids, so if you're usually listening to pop or rock this will suit your needs quite well. Without a dedicated subwoofer or tweeter, I wasn't expecting it to be great in the lower and upper ranges, but the drop-off in quality is stark. I don't consider myself an audiophile by any means, but even I could notice that orchestral/symphonic arrangements sounded decidedly worse.<br /><br />The volume on this has a decent range for most applications. I'm not sure it would be loud enough for a frat party, but for a guy in his 30s who occasionally has people over for dinner and games it's good enough. Vocal quality stays pretty consistent through the entire volume spectrum; instrumentals fall off at the low end but retain their quality at the higher volumes.<br /><br />The lights on the speakers do a slow cycle through colors. They start out synced but very quickly fall out of sync, first noticeable between the lower light bar and the side light bars, but eventually even the six light sources on the lower bar drift from each other so that there's no rhyme or reason to the lights. Unlike other products I've used with features like this, you can only have the lights on this disjointed multicolor slow pulse or turned completely off; there is no option to have, say, a solid color. The touch on/off button is responsive to even light touches.<br /><br />I do like that the unit is self-contained with a minimum of cords: just one that comes out of the back that splits at the end, a USB plug for power and an aux plug for audio. It's truly as portable as you can get without it being wireless.<br /><br />Overall, it's an improvement on most stock laptop speakers, but definitely doesn't do better than its $20 price tag.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HlA12L42L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HlA12L42L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HlA12L42L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BRFN13S9,B0C5ZD5W56,AGQQD3QO3XNA7CAMMU5I6RZLYHUA,2023-02-25 00:21:26.459,0,False,488
86713,5,"The best keyboard case for my 12.9"" iPad Pro 6th generation","I bought myself a 12.9"" iPad Pro for Christmas 2022 and am so happy that I ended up with this keyboard case. I have had several iPads over the years and have purchased a keyboard case for everyone of them, but I had never experienced the floating cantilever design before. I first saw this feature on The Apple Magic keyboard, but I refuse to pay $350 for something that should be half the price!<br />This keyboard case has many great features beyond the floating cantilever stand. The keyboard is backlit and has a good feel to it making it easy to type. The most important feature of the keyboard for me is that it is almost always awake and ready to type when you start typing. My other keyboards would go to sleep fast and wake up slow, which was a major distraction!<br />The iPad attaches to the case via magnetic attachment, meaning that you don't need to squeeze the iPad into a rim or lip, you just attach and detach it at will by pulling it off of the magnets, but it stays securely in place if that's what you prefer. The case edge protrudes about 1/16"" all around to protect the iPad's edges, and give a little bit of an edge to hold the Apple Pencil in place on the magnetic mount.<br />The vegan leather case is well constructed and has a good feel. The softer texture helps it stay on my lap when I'm playing games or surfing the web while sitting on the couch at night.<br />This is my second keyboard case for this new iPad. I immediately ordered a keyboard case with a 360º swivel and 180º flip case when I bought the 12.9"" iPad Pro. That case sounded good on paper, but it failed in many ways. As mentioned above, the keyboard would go to sleep even during a brief pause, and would take several keystrokes to wake up. It was heavy and made of hard-smooth texture plastic so it would slide off of my lap. The 360º swivel and 180º flip hinge mechanism was very stiff and required 2 hands to open/close the case.<br />Thanks to Amazon's return policy, I was able to return it and immediately order this Magnetic Keyboard Case with Cantilever Stand. I can honestly say that of the many keyboard cases that I have owned over the years, this is the best ever!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QHwCmlifL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QHwCmlifL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QHwCmlifL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BFW5SXX2,B0BZMSSLBM,AG4GKO26FTPE2F737PVQ43VBWK6A,2023-02-01 20:20:09.822,17,True,488
884496,4,"bright, configurable, but pricey","A solid, heavy, and expensive ""connected"" LED panel. It's very bright, going up to 2800lumens. The light is very quick to change & consistent once set. The panel is configurable via app.<br /><br />While the panel is marketed for streamers and gamers, it would work for anything that needs a configurable  direct lighting set up.<br />I tried it out for product photo lighting and portrait lighting. For these use cases you'd have to adjust your shooting environment-- for close-up use, a softbox or something else softening the light would be better. The bare panel would otherwise need to be mounted at some distance from the subject to avoid glare.  I'd assume that to be the case for video conferencing as well.<br /><br />The android app has a distressingly low number of downloads, and the app itself is a bit clunky-- not following modern Android design guidelines. Tapping and dragging the sliders, back-and-forward screen actions don't quite work as I'd expect.<br />The app offered a firmware update for the light initially. That update failed, and there's no way to check or re-trigger the update. Buggy or broken. But the lighting controls work.<br /><br />Other thoughts: The minimum height of the mounting rod makes it hard to put this panel on the same level as the subject. It's more likely to be shining somewhat downwards, although it does support side positions that lower the height of the bottom of the panel (by positioning it vertically). It would be nice if it would fit a light stand or tripod mount, to provide options other than clamping it to a desk.<br /><br />I like Razer products a lot. This one is typically well-made, but a bit too expensive for a multi-range LED light panel.<br />I don't think the app / smart-interface adds much over physical onboard controls-- and that lack of physical controls could be problematic if you need the same mobile devices for whatever activity you're lighting. Maybe if you have a bunch of these panels to set up identically, but at this pricing and pictured use-cases, it's hard to imagine somebody having more than two.<br /><br />Recommended if you game or need auto-color-changing features., but mind the price.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iBb3YuZPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iBb3YuZPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iBb3YuZPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09NF3RPYY,B09NF3RPYY,AGMITI35DNIHMTUWA6JSEYH43FGQ,2023-04-04 20:19:04.173,0,False,488
617284,2,It could be a great except for the Blink Module,"After an incident that occurred with my neighbor where he had more than a couple of drinks, I decided to have a Smart doorbell with motion detection for mild security on my home. I was not planning to spend too much, and I'm quite a fan of Amazon products. So I decided to get a Blink Doorbell bundle with the Sync Module 2, additionally I pair my purchase with a Blink exterior camera. The process to connect everything was pretty easy and simple, only my chime was not compatible and was buzzing if I wired the Doorbell. So I left this connected only with notifications through my Echoes.<br /><br />A few months later, the Sync Module starts to lose connection and no matter what steps to resolve the issue I performed, always prompted a message that my Wi-Fi or Password was incorrect, when in reality was not. Eventually, after several attempts on its own was back online and a few months later again the same issue keep repeating over and over. So I contacted customer support to seek a replacement. Which is the worst by all means, regardless of what you described of the steps performed on your own, they always reply with the same scripted troubleshooting steps like if you were talking with a bot. In a thread of 18 emails, instead of replacing my module, they decided to blame my internet connection. As always the module a couple of weeks ago decided to get back online, clearly I have a defective product that Blink support did not want to replace or recognized.<br /><br />A few months ago, I upgraded my Wi-Fi connection to a Mesh system. I was afraid to switch the connection, but I went through and luckily there were no issues, or at least I thought so. It turns out my echoes does no longer starts the live view. At the end the culprit was, as always, the Sync module This time, thinking I have fixed the Wi-Fi issue, I restarted the connection of the module. To my surprise it does not connect anymore and always shows the same error message that my password is incorrect and lights on red and from there I have not found solution. Now my Doorbell and the camera are useless without the module.<br /><br />In conclusion, the doorbell is great, unfortunately the Sync Module 2 does not work. I found online through several forums, the same experience that I have and Blink Support does not resolve anything.",[],B08SGC46M9,B0BM2YG2K7,AEIARORXWC2FHUYZ3RQNYSNREHGA,2023-04-24 02:28:13.535,1,False,488
606715,5,UNREAL AUDIO!!!! 1000/100!! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED,"Got it the Between Pros yesterday. Thought it was another set of regular earbuds. I kept seeing on my feeds on FB and Instagram. They weren't lying.  So let's start off with<br />Packaging - it comes in a nice black box. Opened up pretty easy.  Getting it out was a little rough from the foam. Nice design.<br />The unit itself - opened it, had a little difficulty with getting the earbuds out. Realized the magnets are pretty strong, so I had to tap them out forcefully them out of their box. Easy set up without the instructions. But read them afterwards.<br />Audio - INSANELY UNREAL,  I didn't expect these to be that unreal.  I feel like I'm in a concert or a club. I checked my volume on my phone and it was only at half unlike my Samsung earbuds I have. Noise cancellation is WAY too good.  I can't hear anything else, you'll get shoulder taps in the gym for sure when you are focused.  Sounds quality is easy too good. I can hear every beat, tremble and bass. It's honestly too good. Volume controls are easy to use: double press on right earbud for increase, and left earbud to decrease volume.<br />Range - I walk out my bedroom to test out for before it loses its connection to my phone.  It's a good 20 ft or more. So best not to lose the case or even it entirely.<br />Connecting to devices - can connect to anything that is Bluetooth capable. Laptop, Steam Deck,  Samsung,  Apple,  etc... I am,  so far, a dedicated user to these earbuds. I don't think ever buy another set of earbud brands except these. Well worth the price and knowing what matters to the user.<br />Battery life - is left to be known. Because I didn't test it out that far yet.<br />Overall quality 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟<br />No exaggeration it's that good!<br />Apple and Samsung earbuds users , I challenge you to try them out.  YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61G1bJfaalL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61G1bJfaalL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61G1bJfaalL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08PYSNG35,B08PYSNG35,AHO35WYLY6E7KQMDGYLNY55HEEYQ,2023-01-18 18:03:01.431,18,True,488
959266,3,"Good but, misses with the back zipper","[[VIDEOID:6aed27f522d46d9a28965b45f19ad3a4]] The Chargella Waterproof PU [faux] Leather Laptop Messenger Shoulder Bag has quite a few positive. It has handles along with a detachable shoulder strap to give you the option of wearing the bag on one shoulder or as a crossbody bag. Overall, the outside of the bag is approximately 11 inches tall, approximately 13 inches long from bottom outside corner to bottom outside corner. The deepest section within the bag is about 11 inches deep. The back pocket is about 5 1/2 inches deep while the front pocket is about 7 1/2 inches deep. The material is very soft.<br /><br />I unloaded my everyday crossbody bag and found that everything from it fit inside this bag. I also easily found room for my iPad Pro and had room to spare.<br /><br />The negative is about 1 issue only: zippers. Specifically, 2 of the outer zippers are problematic. The top zipper is meant to open beyond the length of the bag but, even when I straighten out the end of the zipper tag, the zipper itself struggles to reach the end of the track. That is more of a minor annoyance to me because I had no problem fitting my things inside the bag. Another person might need the zipper to open fully and then it would be a  bigger problem for them.<br /><br />The back zipper gets stuck in one place over and over. In the video, you'll see me using one hand (the other hand was holding my phone to film). But, prior to the video, I used both hands a few times to try to get the zipper not to stick. I double checked to make sure that the fabric onto which the zipper is sewn was not getting in the way - it wasn't. There is no visible impediment. But, maybe the cause is related to the seam that brings together the two back panels. The upper part of the seam meets just under the zipper.  It's possible that the extra material depth right there is the culprit.<br /><br />I would be concerned with putting anything important in that pocket, anything to which I'd need frequent access. I intended to put hand wipes, gum and a few other things in the pocket but, I think I'll leave it empty.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZVw64VP5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZVw64VP5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZVw64VP5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gpq3633iL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gpq3633iL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gpq3633iL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81B-9EvRMAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81B-9EvRMAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81B-9EvRMAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B2C6DTVG,B0B2C6DTVG,AGMFB5GFGDXIP2IMY4JTHECSEVNA,2023-01-29 22:24:57.782,0,False,488

It's exactly what I needed.<br /><br />My car is 1 model year before Apple Car play  was added by my manufacturer, and a few years before Android auto (don't know exactly when Android Auto became a thing)... My GF has an iPhone, and I have a Samsung Galaxy...<br /><br />Her car is 3 years newer and has both already... But my car will only play music off of an iPhone almost like connecting a hard drive or something.<br /><br />I saw this and had to have it.<br /><br />I haven't mounted it yet, so no pics, but I hooked it up to test it, and it's amazing!<br /><br />I can connect my galaxy using Bluetooth, but the sound isn't great... This connects with Bluetooth as well... Ehhh... It can also connect through the FM transmitter which doesn't sound great either...<br /><br />What's a person (that wants quality audio) to do? Connect it to your stereo using the provided aux cord.<br /><br />Sounds pretty dam* good...<br /><br />I don't like the GPS that came with my car, and shows on my original screen, so this allows me to use Google maps on my newer secondary screen that will be mounted just above...<br /><br />Honestly, the only drawbacks I can think of is that since it's connected using the aux cord, I can't control the music with my steering wheel controls (but a quick tap of the screen works, or saying ""Hey Google, Next song"")...  And the other is finding the best way to route the cables so they aren't just dangling down my dash and center console... Which is why I haven't taken the time to mount it yet... But there are a couple of easy suggestions right in the manual on how best to do it (and it comes with some cable clips for just that purpose), so I'll mess with it more this weekend.<br /><br />All in all, it looks great, and it sounds great.<br /><br />If your car already has carplay, and Android auto built in to your system, this adds nothing.

10067,4,Worth the Price for My Needs,"[[VIDEOID:d0c907314d7659f36f8231c05b2dc849]] I've been looking at digital pens for a long time and could not make up my mind on which was best for my needs. I simply needed a way to take notes in meetings and transfer them into text fast. The pen does that and more. First unboxing and setting up the pen was as simple as pressing a button and writing (once fully charged). I went with the Neo Studio app after comparing it with others. I don't need productivity and/or task management support so the Neo Studio offered the easiest and best option to simply take notes and convert to text or upload to my designated storage platform or send via email. The Neo Studio app was fairly simple to download on to my very old Samsung tablet and it works seamlessly with the pen. I did not give it 5 starts because one feature appears not to work and I don't know if it is the pen, the app or user error. The pen is supposed to activate simply by beginning to write on the Neo paper. But I have to press the on button to activate the pen before it stores information (when using without the app activated). I learned this the hard way after taking a full page of notes (I didn't have my tablet with me at the time) and then attempting to upload to the app later, there was nothing stored in the pen memory. Lesson learned make sure LED light is lit when taking notes. The Neo paper is required to use with pen. The pen recognizes multiple different notebooks and keeps the notes sorted by the color of the note book. I purchased the pack of 3 books with blue, purple and grey. I use one color for each topic and the pen automatically recognizes which notebook is being used and stores the uploaded notes under that appropriate notebook. The handwriting to text transcribe feature has been about 95% accurate with minor missed letters (mostly due to my handwriting). I was able to improve the transcribe accuracy by slowing down as I write (slightly). One note that I didn't find in the instructions is that when I delete notes in the app it deletes from the pens memory storage as well. So there is no way to retrieve past notes if I haven't saved them elsewhere. I have recommended this to everyone one of my friends that prefer handwriting their notes or keeping a paper calendar.",[],B00ST8GT8W,B00ST8GT8W,AEFPA6FDV6HB3O7FHAJ7UXVUAWHQ,2023-02-02 22:49:39.588,0,True,488
844540,2,"Love the built-in DVD player, but the projector needs more fine-tuning adjustments.","[[VIDEOID:c7ead6d2286a0c61fcc0e6e22ee1d6d5]] The Big Asou DVD projector with Wi-Fi is a great idea having the DVD player built into the projector. Would’ve been nice if it was Blu-ray, but still have plenty of standard definition dvds to play on it.<br /><br />The projector itself is nice and compact and comes with a sturdy little tripod to make it easy to adjust the angle of the projector on a table. Brightness wise, you’re not gonna be using this during the daylight time or in any sort of direct light. Definitely needs to be after the sun is gone down or night time to be able to see it clearly.<br /><br />The projector does have built-in speakers which you can use in a pinch, but you definitely want to connect it to some other speakers to run the audio through. It’s nice that it includes Bluetooth, so you can connect Bluetooth speakers to it quite easily an issue is though that there audio when playing via Bluetooth lags behind the video). The app functionality works fine as well as being able to play movies off of a USB drive, if you don’t wanna use the DVD player.<br /><br />However, a big issue with the projector is how loud the fan is. It is quite annoying and and turns on right away, regardless of how long we’ve had the projector on for. Also when angling the projector up at a wall or screen, which is what most of us are going to be doing, the keystone setting on the back, which adjust the picture on the wall to make it look square, only goes 15° one way or the other, which is not anywhere near enough to get the picture square on the wall. This project really needs to be close to level and projecting straight ahead for the image to look correct. Also, with focusing, if the project is setup and angled more than a few degrees up or down, you’ll have either the top edge or the bottom edge of the screen noticeably out of focus.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this projector, but given the issues with focusing and squaring up the image on the wall plus the loud fan noise, I wouldn’t recommend it.",[],B0B2JY55DP,B0C1S9NT85,AG5G2T3IVXWVKHUC2IPXON466R6Q,2023-01-18 17:02:18.467,1,False,488
795930,5,"Great stabilization in a compact form, perfect for travel with small DSLR cameras","[[VIDEOID:5635179b36cad0b30da9ef54e55debb]] I have experience with gimbals and this is my 3rd Zhiyun. Overall the quality seems decent, and I absolutely love the compactness of this gimbal. it's a solid, lightweight, compact unit. It's perfect for travel using a lightweight DSLR or mirrorless camera. The Stabilization is very good. I ran some quick test and it performed very well. Even more impressive is I wasn't even trying to be steady with my holding and walking which you can see in my video.<br /><br />The unit comes with 3 cables, and I did test the one for my Sony and it worked fine. I was able to trigger the camera from the gimbal. That's a great feature and it's great that Zhiyun includes that! My Ronin did not include that cable and the one I purchased from Ronin is sketchy at best.<br /><br />The light is a nice feature/option to have. If you're in a dark area it's better to have something than nothing at all. It triggers right from the gimbal so you can use it in a pinch. It also comes with color correction filters that snap on.<br /><br />I took one star off for balancing issues. I could not make super fine adjustments and this resulted in it taking longer than usual to get a perfect balance. I did however achieve perfect balance but I think there's room for improvement with adjustability.<br /><br />Adding to my adjustability comment, I was unable to balance my iPhone 13 pro max using my Manfrotto phone clamp/mount. The mount is a little back heavy and the crane did not have enough adjustability for me to properly balance it. So if you want to use your phone you may want to consider using Zhiyun's phone mount.

802098,5,Good enough for my basic needs,"I don't use my desktop computer for much by way of sound output (not really using it for streaming music or videos, and not a heavy use for gaming - that's what I do on my laptop). My desktop fills more utilitarian needs, but it's speakers were dying so I bought these.<br /><br />They are quite basic and work well enough in that regard. I appreciate they are USB powered, though why they don't also do sound through the USB is weird. You have to plug in a USB cable for the power and an  audio cable for the sound output.<br /><br />A few downsides:<br /><br />(1) The physical volume control is a rotating switch attached to the audio line. This means that to access it once everything is connected, you have to reach behind one of the speakers to use it. Since my speakers are placed to the back edge of my desk, this means that this switch is dangling off the back of my desk and inconvenient if not nearly impossible to reach -- so, I just set it to full volume and then use the system's software volume control.  I'd much prefer for this sort of physical control to be ON the front of the speaker.<br /><br />(2) The length of the wire connecting the two speakers is rather short. My desk isn't the largest, and yet I can't place the speakers to each back corner of the desk to put them the potential maximum distant apart that I'd like.  The wiring is about a foot shorter than I'd like. My prior speakers had much longer wiring, though they were a much higher price when originally acquired than these.<br /><br />(3) Being as these are so basic, there's no headphone jack on the speakers themselves (as I had on the speakers they are replacing). So if you want to use headphones, you'll need another solution and then, likely, software switch the output through your system controls to toggle between speaker or headphones.  For me, not a big deal overall because I have a separate USB headset already for use in video conferencing though it's annoying to have to manually switch between the two in system settings.<br /><br />Anyway, for the price there a reasonably good deal with generally good sound output for basic needs.  Would NOT recommend if you wanted a solid surround-sound experience.",[],B07DDK3W5D,B07FCKYFRC,AHO3C7HOR2H5WEMCKUGTBKRPWTHQ,2023-04-18 03:55:55.423,6,True,488

603798,5,Great little amp to run passive speakers from my desktop computer,"I've had many sets of PC speakers over the years.  I always thought I should be able to have the speakers I really wanted to listen to, instead of the speakers I had to settle for.  I was all set to drag out one of my older Onkyo receivers to do the job, but I really didn't want to use a full blown receiver to do this and I didn't want a full size receiver taking up valuable office space.<br /><br />I stumbled across these small Fosi Audio amps in one of my searches.  I picked the BT30D for several reasons.  First was the compact size.  This is exactly what I imagined when it came to a small powerful office sized amp.  It fits perfectly and conveniently under my desktop.  It's out of the way, doesn't add clutter to my desk and at the same time, it's always within reach.<br /><br />I don't use or need the BlueTooth capabilities that this guy offers because I was only interested in connecting it to my computer.  It has RCA line inputs that I connect my computer to, left and right speaker binding posts, passive subwoofer RCA jacks and a powered subwoofer RCA jack.  There's also the BlueTooth antenna jack and the DC power supply input.  Because of the small format of this amplifier, I would recommend also spending a few extra bucks and getting some banana plugs that you can add to your speaker cables.  You don't “need” them, but it makes connecting up your speakers a ton easier.  You would need very small fingers to be able to screw down the binding posts.<br /><br />So, my system has a pair of Bowers & Wilkins bookshelf speakers and an Elac subwoofer.  This amp powers these all very well.  One of the main purposes I had for buying this amp was so I could listen to music (which I usually enjoy very loud).  So far, I haven't been able to turn it up all the way, it really has good power.  The frequency and volume knobs for the subwoofer work really well too.  Plenty of power all around.  The sound is clean and my desktop system has never sounded anywhere near this good.  For the price, I was really blown away.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61p9nW9MyxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61p9nW9MyxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61p9nW9MyxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LzkaoVe7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LzkaoVe7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LzkaoVe7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MoHxKdWfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MoHxKdWfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MoHxKdWfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07K7NJ4QN,B07K7NJ4QN,AHYEJUAJCNAPPTYFDCHQPFLAODZQ,2023-02-18 17:37:11.425,1,True,488
115757,5,Battery is pretty powerful and lasts longer than some other tablets I have had,"Pros, Likes, and Features<br />*Comparable to other tablets on the market this is about the same except it can also connect to 4g lte internet service with a sim card and data plan through your wireless carrier.<br />*This has the capability of dual sim so you can have 2 lines of service on this tablet. Handy if you travel a lot and need phone or data service in areas where one or another is available and you need to be able to go back and forth<br />*Mine came mostly charged, I didn't have to charge it to use it for quite a while out of the box<br />*Audio and mic pickup is good. Had no issue video chatting on it through zoom and Facebook messenger for testing. Colors and brightness are acceptable and I have no complaints there.<br /><br />Cons, Dislikes<br />*Where can I get a rubberized protective case and screen protector for this? Only options I see so far are the universal ones. I would like to see some more dedicated products for devices like this. What if I want a rugged case and a glass screen protector? This should be something that could be ordered or provided or even included by the manufacturer but I don't have any option but with universal products here..<br /><br />I don't have any cons for this device. It is a lower end tablet with dual sim card capability for connecting to cellular services. Can connect to Verizon and ATT both so if you travel it works in areas where one or the other would work better or when one isn't available at all. I have good comparable signal to that of my cellphone with it and have tried it on the ATT network and everything tested good. I have yet to try others but I don't anticipate any issues being this is unlocked it should work with all of them. The Audio and Video are clear and sound good and I don't have any issues with the touch capability and it charges fairly quick with the included charging cable and adapter. I don't know if this can be charged wirelessly as I never tried and the charging cable with take a few hours to fully charge so it would be best with an overnight charge when needed. I think it is a pretty decent tablet with connectivity most tablets do not have for this price. Because of that I think this stands out from most other tablets apart from name brand tablets.",[],B0BPM42TJG,B0C38DPQZL,AGHE2EDF3FFNNWAVGAQ4S6K7PBKQ,2023-01-04 20:49:53.083,2,False,488
184328,5,"Handy Light, Built to Last","I love this little light for quick-shooting situations where I don’t want to set up my larger light panels.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />It is very light, and it is still easy to handle my phone or tablet even when the light is mounted. And the small form-factor fits easily in a pocket when not in use.<br /><br />Very simple to use. Just 3 buttons control everything.<br /><br />Choice of 3 Color Renditions, 3000k to 6500k for household warmth to daylight cool.<br /><br />Choice of 10 light levels by short presses of the +/- buttons, or continuously variable by long press.<br /><br />Although it is small, the light is nice and even, and considerably softer and more flattering than the led ‘flash’ built into phones.<br /><br />The versatile spring-clip allows you to direct the light where you want, and I felt the mounting clip was safe for my devices.<br /><br />Although light-weight, it is designed to last, with a threaded metal socket for the mounting bracket, and an all-metal, locking, mounting foot included for use with a cold shoe.<br /><br />I tested the run-time from a full charge, and it was about 1:53 to shut-down at full output. Recharging time was about 1 hour.<br /><br />Comes with a C Type charging cable, but no charger.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Although the mounting clip seems gentle and safe for my devices, it needs to be said that the attachment COULD be more secure. Be careful not to wave your device around with this light clipped on, or you might inadvertently crash-test this light as it is flung off. Good for use with mindful handling only.<br /><br />Although the product page shows 360 degrees of rotation, this is only done by loosening the clip attachment. It will have to be re-tightened to secure the light. Not as convenient as a mount that ACTUALLY rotates.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: A very handy light for many uses, for both people and objects. Allows me to be lazy (and not do a studio setup) when I just want a quick photo.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615SIXU77uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615SIXU77uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615SIXU77uL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619T9VRV4cL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619T9VRV4cL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619T9VRV4cL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZbHhIdiUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZbHhIdiUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZbHhIdiUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bosRsWB8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bosRsWB8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bosRsWB8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BLVV6KDX,B0BLVV6KDX,AFMD5BRBVMZ6RZDDOKGL462KTUYA,2023-01-14 01:58:03.774,0,False,488
25150,1,"Inexpensive, Good Sound Quality. Otherwise....","This MP3 Player sort of reminds me of a Creative Labs MP3 Player I had decades back. But worse.<br /><br />The OS takes some getting used to because the buttons/clicks work in ways that are annoying. For instance, you press the circle control to the Right to get the menu to go Down. Pressing the Down button is the Go-Back function. And so on.<br /><br />What is absolutely most annoying is the transfer method and speed. Silly me, I thought I could load up a micro SD card with MP3 files, stick it in the device, and play. But no, the SD card is not recognized. So you have to stick the SD card in first and then connect the player to your computer to transfer. Then it will worked just fine.<br /><br />But I have two issues with this. First, I know absolutely nothing about this company other than it is made in China. How can I be sure there isn't some sort of malware embedded in the firmware? I can't and I'm betting the average user would be able to be sure either. So connecting this device directly to my PC is a real problem. Fortunately, I had one of those cheap mini-PCs on-hand for just this type of use.<br /><br />Second, the transfer speed is ridiculously slow. It took over 40 minutes to transfer about 1.5 GB. That's ridiculous. Imagine how long it would take to fill up a 64GB card...?<br /><br />So these two issues are what's meriting a 1-star rating from me. So annoyed by this was I that I didn't bother to check out the radio or Bluetooth feature (the ebook reader function is an artifact from the old days; I didn't even consider looking into it).<br /><br />Yes, it's very inexpensive. Ridiculously so. That's good. And, to be honest, the speaker sound is incredible. I was amazed how good it was.<br /><br />But the direct-connect requirement (with its attendant PC security concerns) and the ridiculously slow transfer speed are two huge impediments. Hence, my 1-star rating.<br /><br />Fun, yes. Cheap, yes. Worth it, I don't think so.<br /><br />1 star.",[],B0BCQ3VKL6,B0BCQ3VKL6,AHU5CEFMHIARA3FUDNNHQJTVKEDA,2023-03-05 14:25:48.430,0,False,488
832794,5,Can't Go Wrong W/ H5 Flow,"Let me start by saying that this is a great case. The build quality is excellent. I had no intentions of ever doing any kind of liquid cooling. Although a custom cooling solution can be placed here, I don’t think the case is suitable for a full-fledged liquid solution due to the closed off bottom, limiting space.<br /><br />All the fans were from NZXT, until I updated 3 of them with a Corsair LL120 RGB 3-pack kit.  The toilet 120mm, and front 140mm fans remain as I didn’t want too much lighting. (See before and after pics).<br /><br />The only real gripe I had was actually my fault. Although the case is rated for a max GPU length of 360mm (approx. 14.17 in.), and the GPU I bought is 344mm (approx. 13.5 in). I failed to account for the measurements for the Z bar that the XFX Radeon 7900 XT included for support. I do suggest an alternate solution for support for the big GPUs as one, it is absolutely necessary, and two, there are solutions that will easily fit in this case. (see Z bar pics and alt. support bracket I very quickly swapped to). I also included a pic with my old Radeon 5500 XT, which easily fits and doesn’t require support.<br /><br />The spacing for cable management is excellent, although due to the toilet (gpu) fan, you don’t get the entire bottom for cables, hence using cable extensions can cause cluttering quickly. There are lots of “paths” for cables which help organize, as well as lots of velcro straps attached to the case, and loops for adding more of your own as needed.<br /><br />Nothing much else to say, overall, I am very happy with the case. Looks great, and in my opinion, it is very versatile and best for an air cooling solution. It does only come with the toilet and rear fans. I do highly recommend adding the maximum amount of fans for the best air-flow. Furthermore, I would only use 140mm front fans for best intake.<br /><br />If I had the space, I would’ve gone with an H7, but you can’t go wrong with the H5 Flow.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Q-WH7D-6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Q-WH7D-6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Q-WH7D-6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7136OrUCCcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7136OrUCCcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7136OrUCCcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71B+rD3JZrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71B+rD3JZrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71B+rD3JZrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oAiIpAeAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oAiIpAeAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oAiIpAeAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Y0M0+MBwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Y0M0+MBwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Y0M0+MBwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B6Y15C5L,B0C5JVXSW6,AFZCCKU262P7XMFIIUAL5WEW2DZQ,2023-03-28 16:16:50.660,1,True,488
858894,5,Excellent value for a big ball head,"This is a big 55mm low profile ball head that can handle 88 pounds of load, so it will most likely handle pretty much any camera/lens combination you'll have. In fact, it might be a little overkill for most camera rigs, but when you want a big ball head, this is a great choice, especially if you're on a bit of a budget.<br /><br />I tried it with a few of my zoom lenses, including a 150-600mm, and the ball head felt very secure and will lock down tight. I will say that the movement isn't quite as smooth as some higher priced ball heads I have, but for the price, I don't think it's worth complaining about. If you want super-smooth, spend another $100 for a higher end ball head like the Leofoto LH-55 (https://amzn.to/3X43mmf), which is still considered a value brand, but produces a very high end product. Or if you want the very best and can pop for $520, get the Really Right Stuff BH-55 Head (https://amzn.to/3YoQEzE).<br /><br />I think the reason this Weyllan head isn't as smooth is due to the ball itself, which has a bit of texture (see my pictures) compared to the more expensive brands. If you look at the more expensive heads, their ball is extremally smooth, which would make sense that it would translate into a more smooth action. I am assuming this is where the money saving comes in. The panning action is also less smooth/fluid than the higher end heads, but again, that's to be expected at this price level. Frankly, super smoothness isn't that big of a deal for most still photographers anyway.<br /><br />Minor smoothness observations aside, this is a very capable ball head, with great features and load capabilities that is also an excellent value. I appreciate the size of the main knob, which is heavily knurled and can be adjusted while wearing winter gloves, which is important to me when shooting in the Colorado Rockies.

839608,4,portable,"As boomboxes go this model has lots that’s recommendable.  It is easily portable (although a bit heavy) with a foldable handle on the top. Sound quality is very good, even rich.  An equalizer function adjusts to music genre--I used the “classical” setting but I’m not sure how much of difference this made.  Nevertheless, the sound was fine for the operas and classical music that I play.  Good volume for a device of this size.<br />Mode settings allow for various formats:  cds, radio, and Mp3 hookup with an Aux cable (not provided).  Especially welcome is the flash drive port that allowed access to my extensive list of downloaded music files. The Bluetooth function pairs easily.  But there is no cassette player, a disappointment for collectors like me who have large (admittedly old) tape collections.<br />Controls are all over the unit.  An illuminated blue screen on the top front clearly displays what is playing.  Manual controls are on the top—volume, cd operation—but this can be bypassed by using the remote that is provided.<br />But other parts of the operation are problematic.  There is a power button on the remote and on the top of the device.  But there is also another on/off button on the bottom back that must be engaged.  This is awkward for me since I usually place my boombox on the top of a bookcase in my study.  Moreover, the unit has a power cord for the re-chargable battery, as well as operation.  Yet it is recommended that this wire be disconnected if the unit is not being used over an extended period of time.  For me this is inconvenient.  I prefer to leave my radios and other players plugged in and ready to go. I suspect that the makers of this device want users to rely on the battery for power.  This is fine for those who wish to carry the unit around but not for those who intend to leave it one place.<br />The Klim is a bit larger than your typical boombox.  It also has a flat, squareish design.  Valuable instruction manual with customer support contact information.<br />Overall, a worthwhile product that could be better.  OK for those who mainly want a portable device.",[],B0BN32H7BV,B0BXNK6B1Q,AFIN6LOVNJR6C2STH5UEVSDAB3DA,2023-03-13 01:08:02.122,1,False,488
17523,5,"This is a great router, especially when used as one half of a mesh pair.","This is a handsome looking router, which does not have to be hidden out-of-sight. The antenna are neatly hidden inside. That is, it's great looking if you like a minimalist, business-tech look; if don't like that aesthetic, it may look like a black toaster which has no place in your living room. (However, I put mine sideways on a bookshelf where it blends in easily.)<br /><br />I have looked at a good number of wi-fi routers. The main point about this particular one is that it is a great mesh router for persons who live in large homes, or a homes with thick plaster, brick, or steel-framed walls or walls with metal pipes (which all interfere with wi-fi radio transmissions). It has three radio bands, one 2.4 gHz frequency band, one lower 6 gHz band, and one upper 6 gHz band. When used as a two (or three or more) unit mesh system, the upper 6 gHz band keeps each individual unit synchronized wirelessly. In some other three-band mesh systems, the synchronization needs to be done with ethernet cables installed between each unit.<br /><br />If this router is installed as a single, non-mesh, system the two 6 gHz bands can be re-united in the system settings to get up to a 160 gHz wide (very fast) broad wi-fi channel. Otherwise, the 6 gHz band cannot be wider than 80 gHz, which is still fast. (And given all the possible things which can interfere with a radio signals, it is sometimes impossible to get a full 160 gHz wide band, anyway.)<br /><br />The other thing which I really like about this and other Asus routers is that it, and they, come with a free-for-life software firewall. Most other big router companies make you buy an annual software firewall subscription, or do without.<br /><br />This is a good, stand-alone, single unit wi-fi router, with a neat, tech look. However, for the money, there are other decent single unit wifi routers, if you don't mind antenna sticking out or subscribing to software firewalls. But as a part of a two or three unit mesh system, it's hard to beat this router for the price.",[],B08HMFRP9B,B08HJ49SLH,AHJKZILEKKULUQVW6PTHEUDBJQGA,2023-02-01 00:02:59.713,0,False,488
972083,5,A great monitor with 2 minor issues.,"I have used multiple oled monitors in the last couple of months and each of them had their own issues. Including this one. But in this case the positives outweigh the negative. The picture quality with its contrast, inky blacks and motion clarity is the best you can get. Absolutely stunning. In comparison to aw3423dw (which uses the same panel), in my experience the Samsung takes the cake with less issues and noises. It has no fans or loud coil whine noise with an external power supply. My unit didn’t have dead pixels unlike other monitors I have had. Flicker is also non existent. The firmware updates through WiFi automatically when you turn your screen on after there has been an update. All in all a perfect screen. Now, there are 2 issues:<br /><br />1. The bigger issue out of the two is that the monitor sometimes does not want to connect to the pc even though the pc is outputting a signal. You will have to either restart the pc or reply the display cable in the back of the monitor. I already tried contacting Samsung about this issue but it’s useless because they are blaming my own pc for this issue. Keep in mind this is a known issue and you can find people talking about it on the internet. I’m sure this issue can be fixed with a firmware update and that is the only reason why I would give this 5 stars instead of 4. The aw3423dw does not support firmware updates and if this was the case with that monitor then you’d be dead in the water. But there is hope with this one.<br /><br />2. The monitor comes with a remote to change your settings, and it has been confirmed that the next issue is not related to the remote. Sometimes (very rarely) the volume on the monitor itself changes automatically one up and you will have the volume indicator popping up on the left side (like a tv). This can be annoying if you are immersed into a game or movie and then have to look at the volume indicator until it disappears. Not a big deal for me because I don’t use the monitor speakers. It also happens very rarely. The tv feature seem a bit gimmicky sometimes but it’s acceptable.<br /><br />Otherwise, great monitor. Definitely the best ultrawide monitor in this format.",[],B0BLF2RWNV,B0C3VRH58B,AGEWY7463D6G3ITXJNGQBICWPM7Q,2023-02-15 04:47:29.083,3,False,488
874174,4,Spendy but gets the job done,"I used this vertical mount solve several issues in my AM4 refresh.<br /><br />I have an Asus ROG Strix-E Gaming X570 board in a Cooler Master H500M case. Which has worked great for a long time. When I moved away from the GTX 1070 and upgraded to a Asus TUF 4070 Ti, the card would no longer fit in the vertical location built into the case (max 2 slot).<br /><br />The new card is 3.5 or so wide... x570 chipsets have active cooling on most boards, and when plugged into the mobo - the 4070 TI completely blocked the chipset cooling solution.<br /><br />Enter the Cooler Master V3 mount!<br />This mount is not the sturdiness award winner of the world. No, your GPU will not fall out. But it will wiggle around and that's by design. I wouldn't want anything particularly rigid here since we're using a riser cable that needs some flexibility to keep from breaking things. Furthermore there is adjustability front to back to accommodate length as well as side to side to accommodate width and monitor cabling. Your mileage may vary here as there's not going to be gobs of room to work with on every case. If your case has a fully open expansion slot area, you'll probably be okay. If it has beams between each slot where the knock out plates are, you may need to remove them to make this work - especially if you're running multi monitor or bulky aftermarket cables.<br /><br />This mount allowed me to roughly center my GPU so there's equal cooling on all sides. I added an additional 140mm fan up front right behind the 200mm fans that come with the case, and curved it with the GPU temp sensor to give it a little boost when things get warm. A slight curve here is less noise than a 60% curve off the triple GPU fan. I found this was overall more efficient!<br /><br />If you have a GPU with minimal RGB, you'll be a little unimpressed I'm sure. If you have a big beautiful thicc boi GPU with flashy RGB, this is how you get it visible in your case.<br /><br />(Who's idea was it to design a beautiful GPU and then spend eleven cents developing a backplate?)","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ebUprcv8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ebUprcv8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ebUprcv8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B72D88KL,B0CFW637BR,AHOXEHKN4Z7ZAPI2N7KHA6XJ6EEQ,2023-03-15 14:27:22.347,1,True,488
359070,5,Phenomenal sound for the price!,"I'm not going to lie, I didn't have a ton of hope for the quality of this Bluetooth speaker. They're typically tinny, easy to blow out, have problems connecting, and are generally overpriced for what they are. In addition, I'd gotten this for my husband to use with his computer as he can be the biggest of audio snobs with things like speakers and headphones. I wanted to see what he'd think of it.<br /><br />He did some of the testing for this, and I did some (we were both together for the entirety of it, so I saw everything, as a side-note). He used the speaker with several devices, from laptops, tablets, phones, to his computer (a desktop). He purposely tried to distort the sound and put the volume up to maximum to test the integrity. He couldn't get it to distort or blow out with even his best efforts, aside from ONE time with a specific small range of sound from a device that doesn't communicate the file as clearly as most do today (regarding the coding). That was it. He couldn't make it behave poorly despite his best efforts.<br /><br />Since then, he's carried it around everywhere, between rooms and used it for all kinds of things. He was gloating about it the same night we'd tested it. He loves it. For the price that it is, it's an absolutely amazing deal. This is highly recommended. It has had almost no trouble connecting, it's immediate, and it even has an almost separate range for the volume, which is rare these days. So if you've already maxed out the volume on your device, you can sometimes boost the volume even more with the speaker, as the easiest way to describe this. It has an analog-style dial on the side of the bar for volume, and if you turn it completely ""down"", it will turn off.<br /><br />Overall, we are super happy with this. It's a small little sound bar, easily carried, and sounds amazing, and is very affordable. There isn't much more you could ask for.<br /><br />As a note, the remote hasn't been used as much, but it's there if you need it. Seems to have average range of communication to other remotes of similar quality.

417955,5,Very good product rich in featurea and cables,"Biggest reason to buy THIS system is the seller.  Crazy good service. I asked for an extra camera (free promotion?), and they verified everything else was fine. They mailed extra parts, and called several times with latest shipping and tracking info.<br />Now to the hardware.... Large screen with 2 inputs. Switches automatically to 2nd input when I go into reverse, or will automatically turn on the screen if set to off.  Pretty smart.<br />The other camera can be used for various things. I have one in my horse trailer above the divider to make sure all is good back there. The wide angle lens sees it all and is very clear.  Most would put it as a rear view for the trailer of course.<br />Easy to disable the bright white camera lights which I did to use the license plate camera as a rear view mirror. Didn't want it on upsetting drivers behind me and I have bright LED backing lights already  It's not great at night as headlights tend to show as big white areas with no detail. But, for hitching, it's GREAT.  Way better than my old one.<br />Another great thing, the kit comes with 3 long cables for almost any run length, and the seller would sell or send more.<br />The only very small issue is that the extension cable is meant to connect to a trailer when In use, but when not in use, there is no tethered cap, so it'll get dirty up in there eventually.<br />Installation is what you make of it. Could be fairly easy with the power plug adapter. I hard wired everything on mine and made a custom bracket to hang from the ceiling. Solid install and clean looking. Again, plenty of cable for even an overhead install on a large Super Duty truck.<br />Images can flip and invert for any need, but it's funny that the camera ID which is displayed for a couple of seconds also flips and inverts. Oops.  No biggie.<br />Also recommend the manufacturer set the contrast to 1-10.  It is 1-100 now and there is no need to have that fine of an adjustment for the brightness. It would be nice to set night/day mode faster, as going 50 or so counts takes a while.<br />Summary, great system and I'm VERY HAPPY I bought this one from this seller.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BmAywrYmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BmAywrYmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BmAywrYmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IfbCB6yTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IfbCB6yTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IfbCB6yTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NLMZMFnZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NLMZMFnZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NLMZMFnZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/813hsoEIqoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/813hsoEIqoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/813hsoEIqoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/916hCF8QG2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/916hCF8QG2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/916hCF8QG2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07DBN9SL7,B07DBN9SL7,AH6W5VKVUJ6A5DOEVLCX7OSXLVRQ,2023-01-17 05:12:46.251,0,True,488

532551,4,Good basic trackball mouse,"I've tried a number of trackball mice after deciding to forgo yet another Logitech tb mouse - when they were wired they'd last for years but now that they are Bluetooth they last 2 years or less. For the $60 to $80 price tag, it's just not worth it. So far, this is my favorite, the Lizprot. For half the price, you get a close facsimile of the original. My only complaints: it's much larger than the Logitech - and many of you know the Logitech is actually now larger than prior incarnations; it keeps getting bigger and therefore less comfortable for smaller hands. I'm not sure if there was a surge of construction workers becoming techies or why they have chosen to make these so much larger. The second complaint is that the ball, while precise, is not as easy to move as other trackball mice. While it's smooth and rolls appropriately, it does not speed across the page with a flick of your thumb. So, if you're someone who needs to slide it across a long Excel spreadsheet, or a gamer who needs to fly across the screen, you might not appreciate it the way someone who is doing detailed special effects. And third, I don't like that it goes to sleep quickly. You'll start rolling the track ball after 3-5 min pause & it's disengaged - feels like a glitch. it does wake up pretty quickly but you very often have to depress the left mouse key before it does so and it's a little disconcerting because you're never sure if that left click is going to engage on the screen or just wake up the mouse. For that reason I would not buy this again, but for the price I paid I am keeping it until I resolve or exhaust my search for the perfect new trackball mouse after Logitech let us all down. The colored lights is pretty, the mouse itself is attractive and easy to use, easy to connect to Bluetooth and will connect up to three devices which is a plus. God battery life and can be used during charging. So it's a pretty nice little package for the price of it lasts a year. I think I am going to break down and try that expensive brand and hope for the best. Once you've had track you can't go back.

I had gone through several hard plastic backed covers with my 2018 10th Generation Paperwhite Kindle in the last four years, because for some reason every one of them has cracked in the corners within months, and sometimes weeks, of having it, regardless of the manufacturer. This was never a problem with previous Kindles and hard plastic covers, but for some reason it always was with the 2018 model. The silicone backing on this Kindle Signature cover hugs the Kindle well, and still protects it without any fear of corners breaking at any time. I have been able to find a silicone backed version of it made by the same company for my 2018 Kindle but the choices for covers aren’t as cute. It’s a shame there aren’t more whimsical choices for the 2018 model with silicone backings like the multitude of choices available for the Kindle Signature version. There are some really fun covers for the 2018 model, but they all have hard plastic backings.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to return this cover because the new Kindle Signature I purchased it for was a POS and constantly froze from day one, then started having some other major software issues within the first week. I kept hoping the glitches would work themselves out, but they have only gotten progressively worse. After reading many other negative reviews from people who had the same issues with the new Kindle Signature, I don’t want to exchange it, and chance getting another dud sent to me, then be past my window to return it and be stuck with an expensive and useless e-reader that I have already been tempted to throw against the wall on too many occasions in just a few weeks of having it.<br /><br />If it would have fit my 2018 Paperwhite Kindle, I would keep this cover when I return my Kindle Signature. But unfortunately I have no use for it since it’s larger than what will fit my old Kindle. This cover is of a much higher quality than the taped up cracked corners of the hard plastic one currently on my old Kindle, and I will mourn the loss of such a well designed protective cover.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ArBBAqHAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ArBBAqHAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ArBBAqHAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09L1FS32J,B09L1HPQSD,AGX4FVXW4KU7C43RW3P6ZF44GF7A,2023-01-08 18:38:39.470,1,True,488
420456,5,Very solid board.,"The MSI z790i is probably the best ITX Z board money can buy.  It helps overclocking your cpu and ram really well.  The shortcuts to UV and OC are really handy especially for those less technologically saavy and want the best efficiency or performance with a few clicks.  There is a small fan and it is not obnoxious like other motherboards.  The temps for components on the board are well within spec and the worst is the PCH usually in the 60s and 70s.  I definitely recommend this board over the ROG strix z790 due to the daughterboard issues, the clunky hive module many do not like and the price of it is clearly not competitive for the features presented.  OTOH the MSI z790i is priced very nice and will get you going where you need to go quick.<br /><br />If I had one gripe with this board is I wished the connections were placed different or at least a little more easily accessible.  ITX boards can be challenging in a SFF build and say having all the fan headers placed close together AND in a spot where it's easy to reach all 3 would have been much nicer but that is the price paid for ITX.  Also, XMP has had no problems or hiccups whatsoever.  Once trained boot is quick especially if you're using a high quality gen 4 drive.  You'll be asking yourself what sorcery is this when it boots in ~15 seconds or games where you used to have to wait about 15-20 seconds will load in less than 5 seconds.  The other minor grip I have is I wished the theme of this board more closely resembled that of the MSI z690i.  That board looks very nice.  The silvery whiteness of this board can throw a big wrench into your black themed build.<br /><br />Nonetheless, if you're on the fence about a Z series board this is the one to get, especially if you don't know how to UV.  If you're on the fence between this and a B series board, MSI or Asus might be up your alley if you want to save some money so you can get a better gpu.  Mind you, B boards cannot OC and UV'ing will have to be done manually and most of the guides are for the Asus B boards.

781445,3,Good Smart Watch But With Issues,"[[VIDEOID:68c63cccf148eb628cd690bf0303956f]] This smart watch is stylish and comes with two bands included - one brown and one black.<br /><br />What I Like:<br />--The watch is bright enough to see in the daylight.<br />--The accompanying app (I use the iOS version) paired easily with the watch (after a bit of a problem described below in ""What I Don't Like"".<br />--The app has several different watch face styles that you can download.  I'm a minimalist in that regard, so I appreciated having some options.<br />--Great battery life.  I have been using it for two days now and the battery is at 94%.  Based on that, I think I can expect to get at least a week per charge.<br />--Tracks sleep, steps, heart rate, blood oxygen, etc. and syncs this information to the app.<br />--The app has an option to have a ""free"" account without registration - I opted for this, so I do not know if there are other benefits with registering.<br /><br />What I Don't Like:<br />--Out of the box, the watch was unresponsive.  It was charged and the display illuminated faintly (see pics and video) but it would not respond to the app or to the buttons on the watch.  There appears to be no way to manually reset or restart the watch (nothing in the instructions, and I tried multiple button combinations).  Charging the watch did not resolve the issue.  I ended up letting it sit with the backlight stuck on for a couple of days until it finally ran out of battery and shut down.  After it shut down, it started behaving normally and I've had no issues since.  However, I almost gave it a one-star review and shipped it back before deciding to let the battery run out so it would be forced to restart.  To the manufacturer:  Include a restart/reboot function that can be done without accessing the watch menu!!!<br />--The connections for the band are snug, but the buttons are difficult to press (takes some pressure) and this usually pushes the band out of place a few millimeters.<br /><br />Overall, this seems to be a good watch.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510L5m6bxwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510L5m6bxwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510L5m6bxwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514biXSQxXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514biXSQxXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514biXSQxXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yI4Jc0LBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yI4Jc0LBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yI4Jc0LBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7100jgX3B2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7100jgX3B2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7100jgX3B2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71clJJFv4zL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71clJJFv4zL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71clJJFv4zL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71y0g0FoHpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71y0g0FoHpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71y0g0FoHpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BH178B3K,B0BXRKKXDG,AGAKRQ4TLUKQQILCEQE2WWZVM2RQ,2023-02-15 21:47:50.248,0,False,488
351423,5,Quality Performance and Affordibility,"The sound quality of the X1 Sports Edition “over the ear” earbuds, Tranya’s latest release, is impossible to match. Especially at this price level. These earbuds provide long lasting wear-ability and comfort as well as practical new features like wireless charging and a digital state-of-charge display. I’m always glad to see a device that doesn’t require a unique set of charging cables to add “even more” clutter on my desk. Like most users, my two main considerations when buying audio devices is affordability and sound quality. Pretty much in that order. I’ve discovered over past years, Tranya consistently does not disappoint in either category. On more than one occasion I’ve inadvertently forgotten my earbuds in my clothes following a vigorous workout and thus put them through the wash. I’ve determined this experience to be largely disadvantageous. But, can’t stress how impactful this can be with earbuds costing $200+. At this cost and performance level it almost makes sense to buy an extra pair for emergencies.<br /><br />Having owned (and lost) my share of expensive Samsung, Bose and, Apple earbuds, I can fully appreciate the value of Tranya’s products. If you consider, for around $50 you can enjoy the “best of best” and you haven’t had to make a major investment. It just doesn’t seem to make good (dollars) and sense to decide otherwise. From a technical point of view, the pure audio fidelity, noise cancelation and professional level sound quality are, in most cases, better than competing higher priced offerings. I hasten to add, the clever new “4 mic” feature has significantly improved understandability when making and answering calls. Perhaps a minor attribute to others but, I particularly like the size and accessibility of the mode control buttons. From personal experience, I’ll share, sweaty large fingers do not lend themselves well to the finesse required of typical (petite) earbud controls. Also worthy of mention, the X1 affords ease of setup and operation.<br /><br />I own and highly recommend the Tranya X1 over-the-ear Sports Earbuds. Great product!

It was quick and simple to connect the TV box to my TV and get it up and running. I was impressed by the speed and efficiency of the box when I started using it. The 2GB + 16GB memory provides ample space for downloading all the movies, games, or files you want without any issues. The voice control remote is also a great feature, which made navigating the interface much easier and faster. You can quickly and easily access different apps like Netflix, YouTube, and Google Play with just the press of a button.<br /><br />The picture quality is also impressive. This 4K streaming TV box is optimized for 4K playback, which delivers an amazing processing power (Up to 4Kp@60) to deliver the best content and super smooth interface experience. The HDR10+ support provides high-quality video codecs on the market, including hevc, vp9, and av1. The content looks bright and clear, and the colors are vibrant.<br /><br />The device also has excellent connectivity, including HD port, AV port, SPDIF port, network port, and 2 x USB port, which allow you to establish a high-quality connection for the best visual and audio performance. It also features 2 x 2 MINO Wi-Fi 2.4GHz/5GHz 802.11a/b/g/n/ac along with a 100M Ethernet connection.<br /><br />However, the device does have one drawback. I wish it was a bit more durable.

I just wasn't sure what I wanted, and I found it hard to justify the cost.<br />Then one day I got side swiped by a kid on the phone. I said I was definitely getting one then. Still didn't do it. It wasn't until I had a police officer tell me that I made a right on red, when I know for a fact that I hadn't, that I said decided it was time.<br />I spent several days looking at all the different cams. I didn't want a screen, or some big bulky thing on my windshield. I just wanted a high res camera with a memory card. I also didn't want to spend a small fortune on one, as I figured that may actually entice thieves rather than deter.<br />After my exhaustive search I settled on this one, and I couldn't have been happier. It's so low profile that I forget it's even there sometimes. The features are great, and the software is pretty easy to use. I do wish it were a little easier to get the videos off of it when need be. I'm sure there probably is, but I just don't know it. It still isn't too bad to do while sitting in the vehicle though.<br />I have mine hardwired and that is awesome. The camera was installed for two days when I came out of Costco to a large dent in the side of my truck. Hopped on the camera, was able to see the lady who didn't properly put her cart away, watch as it came flying across the parking lot, and bounce off the side of my truck. I'll never be able to find her, but I know what she looks like.<br />Now, to the reason this is only 4 stars. The SD card that they provided with the camera died. I don't know for how long it hasn't worked either. It's only a few months old, and that's a real bummer. I haven't looked at the warranty yet, but I doubt it's covered.

135037,2,not easy to install,"first off im a professional installer and have been for 23 years. i got this for my commuter car. wanted something cheap and even at dealer cost, the name brands are a lot more expensive. my truck is the vehicle with the expensive sound system. just wanted something super cheap for my commuter car. so heres my take on this radio.<br /><br />this unit takes a lot of work to install if you using iso mount (oem factory brackets and no dash kit). meaning most toyota, subaru, older honda, etc. the face is larger than pioneer, sony, kenwood, and alpine radios. i just spent  few hours installing in my 01 subaru forester. uses isomount. sincs the face is slightly larger i had to drill new holes in the oem bracket to recess the radio back about 1/2 inch so the dash bezel could go back on. the touch screen is not the best. the corners especially, so if you have big hands, its cumbersome. the screen does not have adjustments to alter the image for position. the radio is a little lower in the dash of the subaru and when you look at the radio from the top down angle the screen washes out. looking at the screen dead on straight  is ok, but from the angle im looking at it from the drivers position its got a white haze to it.  the rear view camera is reversed. meaning left is right and right is left. it basically means the camera is a front camera.  no way to switch the image for back up camera. will wait to hear what the manufacturer says about it. there is no way to turn the led lights on the camera off. slightly annoying there too. they say its a wide angle camera but it clearly is not. the image is so narrow i cant see the corners of the bumper. the camera is mounted up high right next to the washer fluid nozzle for the back window. so from almost 3 ft down i have about 3 ft of width. any camera at my shop would see far past the bumper corners. so it looks like im taking this camera out and replacing with one of mine. the android auto is ok though. from what i have tried. not sure if i want to return this or not, but heavily leaning towards it and spend the extra money on a pioneer or alpine.",[],B0B59FB9WN,B0B59FV868,AHVSC6HIW3WPHJRUFNDDIABTQHLQ,2023-02-23 01:58:47.238,1,True,488
531408,5,Very good for the price,"I am very fond of the Maven C series binoculars, and I own several of them. There is a wow factor that this series has that is very appealing. Color rendition, is fantastic. Sharpness at focus is very good, although this larger C4 with it's 18x magnification, is not quite as sharp, as say my C1 10x42. This makes sense, since higher magnification, will bring out the shortcomings of any glass more readily.<br /><br />The one downside, as is the case with most of the C series, is the short depth of field at focus. This means that you will have to focus more often, as you move from object to object. Even with a large tree, some branches will clearly be out of focus, while others are in focus. The C2 compacts also have this issue, but to a much lesser extent.<br /><br />Field flatness is very good, and eye relief is also very good. Much like another reviewer stated, I plan on using this binocular on a tripod, instead of my spotting scope at low power, when low power is the preferred option. I have been frustrated in obtaining replicates of quick release plates for my tripod, but I discovered that by taking off the quick release plate, I could simply rest the binocular on the flat plate underneath, and that actually worked out very well. You do have to hold onto the binocular, but just to ensure that it doesn't slip off the tripod, but I found that very easy to accomplish.<br /><br />Two potential concerns, depending upon your requirements - one, the diopter adjustment is a little tricky, and two, the IPD range, is not very good for those with narrow set eyes. The only way that I could reach collimation with both eyes, was to cut off the objective lens cover from the binocular body. The straps holding the objective lens covers, were preventing me from obtaining the required setting for collimation. Now for me, this isn't a big deal, because I don't plan on using these except on a tripod, so losing the covers, is less of a concern for me, because I will be relatively stationary while using the binoculars. But if you plan on taking these out into the field using a harness, then you might have a problem, if you have narrow set eyes.",[],B093TM8VQ8,B093TJSV7R,AHOUPDBUPUT44SCGVWHATQ6644AQ,2023-03-01 00:32:52.847,0,True,488
380030,5,I LOVE this speaker!,"Holy cow! This speaker is amazing! I don't even know where to begin with reviewing this because I love every feature so much! I'll try to quell my excitement long enough to get some order here.<br />Without further ado, here's a rundown of why this is now my new favorite portable speaker and will likely remain so for a long while.<br /><br />- Sound quality. The sound quality of this speaker is so clean and crisp, I swear I'm hearing lyrics in old songs I never heard before. When you use the fancy SoundPulse button and let the speaker take over the equalizing, your music really comes alive!<br /><br />-BASS. What a thumper! This thing cranks out true bass that HITS. The best part is, the bass doesn't pull power from the highs and mids, so you get a truly full sound.<br /><br />-Battery life. The battery on this lasts long for me because even at 50% volume it is usually plenty loud for most working situations. According to the manual, at 50% with no lights, it'll last for 24 hours. So far I haven't killed my battery yet in use.<br /><br />-Stereo speaker pairing ability. I'll fully agree that one amazing-sounding 40-watt speaker is more than enough for any personal music-listening situation, but what could be better than two in perfect stereo for a total of 80 watts of power? Well, I liked my first one so much, I bought a second one just for this purpose and I can't see needing any sort of home stereo system for a while. I don't even turn it up to 100% volume anymore because it is usually too much for my small space!<br /><br />I don't really see any cons with these speakers. It's not even a ""get what you pay for"" deal. These are actual, good-quality speakers at a reasonable price point. I'm interested in seeing what else Tronsmart will offer in the future because I'm not kidding when I say I'd put these guys on the level as serious competitors with JBL or Sony.

705047,1,Piece of Junk!,"Don't waste your money on this item - notice now the price has been jacked up from other reviews (which stated it was around $30 - now priced between $126 and $135 or so, probably to make it appear a high quality product, which it isn't!).<br /><br />I received mine at a gift exchange party, in a nice gift bag and still sealed in the original container.  It didn't work from the day I opened the package: some CDs played for maybe 22 - 24 seconds, then nothing  and some not at all (all retail CDs, not W or RWs!).  Earphones very uncomfortable (and I have a small head!).  Also, the many of the written controls were so small that, after reading (then re-reading) the manual when it didn't work, just to be sure I was following all directions, which I was) I had to use a powerful magnifier just to read many of the tiny buttons!<br /><br />I first contacted Amazon, since it was the only place I found it online (Bsaw that BestBuy had discontinued selling it), but was told it was not exchangeable for another one without the order number, which I did not have.  I did locate the person who brought it to the gift exchange/""steal"" party, who assured me it was purchased from Amazon!<br /><br />I then contacted Insignia, who only told me the very same thing, even when I reminded them that this was shortly after Christmas and most stores/manufacturers would at least replace a defective item, but Insignia would not make any exceptions.<br /><br />I have now read MANY bad Amazon reviews stating that it either didn't work as it should or stopped working after a very short period of time, and also notice that the price keeps going up and down - have seen a new one at around $60 up to $135 on Amazon alone.<br /><br />My guess is that it's now an outdated product - and probably a cheap bulk purchase by sellers who are trying to just make as much profit from it as they can.  Even the manufacturing company, Insignia, won't stand behind replacing it (I didn't insist on a refund - just asked for one that works!).<br /><br />Buyer beware on this!",[],B000VADPHY,B000VADPHY,AG3H5UHKHI6TZ2KVOG3FUHX4DAPQ,2023-02-04 23:33:10.469,0,False,488
536705,3,A pretty nice bag with just a few caveats - See Review:,"[[VIDEOID:8d0ef6ef3a0e08d827b667e40f8af110]] This review is part of Amazons Vine program. That out of he way, I have to say this bag is actually pretty nice. The bag does hold a 15.6' Mac or Windows laptop with no issues and probably could get away with two, however I wouldn't recommend it which I'll get to why. The bag had 3 colors and I ended up going for the yellow ,which I am glad I did as its a really nice color. It has a lot of pockets and is pretty much as advertised in the ad showing.<br />  Honestly there isn't a lot to complain about its a pretty good computer bag that is indeed water resistant, I got caught in heavy rain and while being concerned my laptop was drowning in rain water , to my surprise it held well. The only reason I am giving this bag a 3 star or average rating is just that, its pretty average. Some of the material  used to make the bag and the faux pockets give it a cheap feel, however it doesn't look cheap at all, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with a good sturdy average bag. The packaging as you can see was very nice and well presented,  the look of the bag as I said has a really premium look to it, the space and individual pockets are very convenient and spacious. I like that it has a top handle on the top is almost like a purse type handle which is great if its holding a bunch of my electronics. That and the back strap that allows you to strap onto luggage when traveling for extra support is a win as well.<br />  This bag is great, it's a middle of the road, average computer bag for a fair price and will do the job well. It has a very nice finished premium look or a designer look, really other than the 2 faux pockets I mentioned and some material feeling a tad under par, thus far it has proven to be a sturdy bag that is a steal and I would definitely recommend. For those that follow my reviews on other social platforms know I give straight up honest reviews good or bad. This bag gets a pass from me and thus far I am enjoying it on a daily basis in travels for business. I hope this review helps someone make a decision on this item and as always best wishes!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61BfQa2ln+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61BfQa2ln+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61BfQa2ln+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HjEkck+5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HjEkck+5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HjEkck+5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Q7HjbKyBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Q7HjbKyBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Q7HjbKyBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61v2lVYtT8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61v2lVYtT8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61v2lVYtT8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61va3JkRcwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61va3JkRcwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61va3JkRcwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fnWYAzepL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fnWYAzepL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fnWYAzepL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BS26J2R5,B0BKRKWMM4,AF53MJ5N4SINT5WPDC6SSWC5DOFQ,2023-03-12 21:07:52.365,0,False,488

519091,5,A great intro to planar magnetic phones.,"Prior to owning these, my best benchmark for headphone quality would be the ATH-M50X, which I'm sure is the case for many going into the world of open-back headphones for the first time. They did the job with their dynamic drivers and closed back design, but now that i never go full-can outside the office, I knew something like these open-back headphones would be ideal for a desktop setup, given they don't get hot or uncomfortable, and i was definitely right about that. I can tell these will last long just from the lack of ear sweat, not to mention solid build quality. I get no creaking or extraneous noises when i put these on, which i love.<br /><br /> I was cautious going in to the planar magnetic side of things due to their iffy reputation among fans of bass, but i can say this is a speaker type definitely worth considering as open back headphones, and I'm now in love with this style. Now the bass is present and satisfying, but less pronounced than I'm used to, since these are balanced for accuracy. I have a FiiO A3 as my amp, which has a bass booster that doesn't compromise clarity from what i can hear, and does add a satisfying punch to my bass heavy stuff. Combining this type of speaker with an open back design doubles down on width and clarity since you don't have a speaker enclosure trapping and reflecting sound all over the place, but rather a magnetic coil / membrane that is more evenly distributed and allows sound to vent more evenly. These are the only planars i've owned, and they are pretty mid in terms of price range, yet they are the clearest sounding headphones i've ever heard. When it comes to dialing in volume, i was never a numbers guy, now I need to remember my settings so i don't risk pushing the volume, which is a good problem for these headphones because you'd need to deafen yourself just to find any distortion on these. The instrumental separation is unreal, lyrics will POP! Your ears will get drawn into melodic lines getting passed around that were previously almost inaudible. Headphones like this will change how you hear music.<br /><br /> If you're ready to drop a significant buck on your first quality pair of accurate monitors for a room with low background noise, these will blow your mind!",[],B077XDWT7X,B077XDWT7X,AHHA6T53XFVGP74RE2VVCBX5OWKQ,2023-01-26 01:54:44.791,2,True,488

304936,3,No port isolation. Instructions are inadequate. Works as basic PoE switch (albeit slower than many).,"I bought this switch for the fact that it advertised ""vlan isolation,""  PoE long distance transmission, and gigabit uplink.  I haven't yet tested the PoE long distance capabilities yet, because the vlan isolation does not work.<br /><br />I plugged my uplink and my client device into each of the uplink ports, expecting that the switch would offer simple unmanaged switching to send traffic from client to uplink.  That worked fine.  Then I plugged both the uplink and the the client device into the 100mbit ports on the left - none of them ""uplink"" ports - and discovered that traffic still went from client through uplink.  Those ports should have been isolated - i.e. traffic should not be allowed between client ports.  That's what I need, and it doesn't do that.<br /><br />Since it isn't a managed switch I'd not expect any vlan port tagging and trunking and such at any rate, but I was certainly hoping for simple port isolation on the client ports.<br /><br />The instruction manual included with the switch is generic, and the diagrams even include pictures of a rack-mount system.  There are no instructions as to what the switch on the front does, which says that it toggles between regular PoE mode and long-distance 10mbit/s PoE mode.  But the product description says that it auto senses the need for that.  So what's the switch for?  I have no idea.<br /><br />The 2Gbit uplinks work fine.  Why would you need a 2Gbit uplink with 8 100mbit client ports though?  Other than switching between the two 2Gbit ports, I suppose, that doesn't seem to offer any benefit.<br /><br />As it is, I can find a use for it, but will have to invest in a more expensive managed switch I think to get the true port isolation I need.  Maybe its long distance PoE run will work - I do have a need for a 200m ethernet PoE run for a remote access point.  If it doesn't, I can always try a PoE range extender.<br /><br />If the seller offers some way to configure the port isolation, I'll certainly change my review!",[],B0BK6FKG5R,B0BK6FKG5R,AFVWJX2W2673TM2ATF44WAP5TQWA,2023-01-08 18:02:50.702,0,False,488
144111,2,Doesn't charge to 100 and call audio is distorted... Might return and switch to Sony.,"Out of the box, the headphones looked great. I have a small head and the headphones felt loose, which unfortunately can't be adjusted.  The product case was black despite me ordering the white smoke headphones, which was a little disappointing, but what can you do?  I bought the headphones for the sound and function, so as long as those work, it will be worth it, right?<br /><br />The headphones themselves sounded okay and the noise cancelling did the trick, however this is where the good steeped off.  I use Discord and Slack often, and bought these headphones to work and game at home.  After one minute on a group call, the audio began distorting and gargling.  This only happened to me on the call, so I can only assume it was the headphones causing this, as I've never had this issue in the past.<br /><br />I had to mess around with the settings in the call a lot, but to no avail, as it would cause my audio to not be heard or cause me to not hear the others on the call.  I had to quit and rejoin the call multiple times for all the issues to eventually fix itself, but in the end, the audio was worse than it had been in the first minute of the call the first time I joined.<br /><br />As for the issue with battery, I can never get the headphones to charge past 80%.  I've had the headphones for a few days now, so I've tried plugging it into different outlets, closely monitoring it, restarting the headphones, and resetting them. No matter what, the headphones never seem to charge past 80% and the light never turns green or solid white (it is always either blinking or orange).<br /><br />I was really looking forward to using these headphones, as I've loved Bose products in the past (particularly my old QC 25s), so I am going to try to do what I can to fix these issues.<br /><br />But if nothing works, I might have to return these headphones and maybe get the Sony wh-1000xm4s instead.  Even though they are more expensive, they might be more worth it if the calls and audio functions better.<br /><br />I will do my best to update if the headphones can be fixed.",[],B098FH5P3C,B0BH6V8TTG,AEMJR6IWXFI7JK2UTT7QAT2ZZR5Q,2023-01-09 18:03:14.410,0,True,488
671605,5,Wow.,"To start, if you're even thinking about trying these can get these for $120 or under, just do it. These are the first iems that I have tried since I got into the hobby that actually blew me away.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I have used these for only a couple of days but want to give my first impressions because I think these are that good. In the last year, I have tried the Moondrop chu, ssp, aria, kato, blessing 2 and s8 as well as truthear zero and hexa and more recently, the qkz x hbb khan. The only iems I have at the moment are the Moondrop S8 and the Letshuoer S12.<br />I also have a pretty small ear and found the blessing 2, truthear zero and qkz khan to be too large and uncomfortable.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />First, the accessories, apart from the case, are absolutely amazing. So many tip options and the nicest cable I have received of all the iems I have tried. The build and fit are also the best I have felt in a long time, super premium and I can wear these for hours with no issue.<br /><br />Looking at the graphs, I was concerned when I saw the treble and upper mid-range spikes as I am pretty sensitive to treble, but I find the S12 to be manageable, and excellent. Compared to my S8, which are a $700 iem, these sound more intimate and upfront, but have a surprisingly similar tuning. I still prefer my S8 as far as tuning but these fell a little more lively and fun. Bass is great, mids are great, treble is great, no complaints.<br /><br />THE BAD<br />The case is a little small. With the quality of the cable, I feel like I'm crushing the buds slightly when they are in the case. Maybe a little to much treble? But that's it, these are great.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />These are so good, I have not tried the timeless which I know these are comparable to, but for under $150 I don't see how these can be beaten especially in terms of comfort and sound.",[],B0B9GVQHFC,B0B9GSLCX1,AHDGQ4UAAHSLICII7UGNT6OTYC3A,2023-01-10 20:33:17.875,1,True,487

I had to heat the edges with a hairdryer and use a thin blade around the edges to allow the iPad to slip into the case.  Don’t believe there is any way the iPad is going to fall out and the edges of the iPad are well protected.  Doesn’t seem to interfere with the screen protector.  Case seems solid and a little heavy, but I expected that — with the keyboard removed my iPad stands nicely on my lap in my chair while watching YT videos which is a key reason I bought it.  I got the grey tweed(ish) case and it looks nice.  The pencil holder is perfect - fits nice and tight and connects and charges while in place.  Couldn’t figure out how to easily get the pen out and then realized you just push from the slot underneath.  Better than any pencil holder I’ve seen on any other case.<br /><br />The keyboard is superb.  Connected almost immediately.  I am a touch typist and the adjustment period was zero!  This is mostly a traditional QWERTY layout so if you’ve gotten used to the new iOS keyboard layout it’s going to be a little different.  I kept pounding the ‘delete’ key and wondering why nothing was happening — it still has the ‘backspace’ key which you may or may not like.  The function keys across the top are pretty handy.<br /><br />I have not figured out exactly how the keyboard stores when you close the case, and can’t find any illustration of it.  It doesn’t “fit” the screen well and I’m not sure how I feel about that.  If I didn’t have the glass screen protector along with Apple Care+ I doubt I’d store the keyboard in the case, and in fact, may not.  But it seems the keyboard will stay in place when the case is folded up.<br /><br />I will update this review if anything changes or if I get clarity / comfort with the way the keyboard stores.",[],B0BN1BCYY2,B08JCXY4YK,AHRS42BXQV5OC4DRBBKBNMSX3GOQ,2023-02-02 20:15:08.666,6,True,487
210582,5,It's about damn time!,"I've been interested in these dash cams for quite some time, and every time I look at them online, they all look similar with similar features. I only cared for a few because of their software integration with your mobile device. They were usually not all that great. Some of them had great features, but installing these cameras took work. I didn't want wires leading to my center console for these cameras to be powered.<br /><br />Then there's the Ring Car Cam, and I was immediately sold. I like the fact that the installation was simple. And when I mean simple, I mean REALLY simple! I was wise to pre-order directly from Ring once they announced it and could get this purchase for $199 to save some money. But on top of that, because I was already a Ring protect subscriber, they gave me an extra $20 off, which made my purchase $179.99!<br /><br />I like the fact that I can connect this to my OBD-II port in my 2023 Land Rover Discovery. At first, I was afraid that the Car Cam would drain my battery, but it didn't. You can set the battery usage to Low (their recommendation) for the shortest active time. This is best for cold days and vehicles drove less than three days per week or with a battery over three years old. And because I work from home and park my car in my garage, it didn't matter to me. The camera is a perfect size and doesn't stick out like a sore thumb. It just blends with my dash.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this camera is the Car Cam flap that covers the rear-facing camera. It's hard to grab hold of the flap in the open position because the space between the Car Cam and the dash is too small. I have big hands, and it's a tight squeeze. The ring team should create an adhesive or an extension attachment to extend the handle of the flap.<br /><br />The graphic user interface is just like their home security system. It shares the same dashboard, so checking my alarm system, front door cam, and my new Ring Car Cam is easy. I hope their future Car Cams would be of higher quality, like 4K and existing customers can trade in for a new, updated version. I highly recommend this product.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71A9BUKZpHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71A9BUKZpHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71A9BUKZpHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08LZFPQNV,B08LZFPQNV,AHCLVGVGFNWSYOIEVHDYMNXQ53DQ,2023-02-20 00:03:37.285,2,False,487
407168,5,Both the light and fan stay on even if the power goes off.,"This light with built-in fan and rechargeable battery arrived fast and in good condition. I found that the light with built-in fan and rechargeable battery runs quiet and uses relatively little power. Please see pictures. A typical 120 volt house wall outlet fan can use about 50 watts of energy per hour.  You could probably run 5 to 10 of these usb light with built-in fan and rechargeable battery on high for the same amount of electricity that 1 house fan would use. The  light with built-in fan and rechargeable battery is relatively light weight and portable. I could see people bringing this light with built-in fan and rechargeable battery with them on a trip and easily powering it with a larger portable power bank or a solar generator. Where I live it snows during the winter and sometimes the power goes off. This light with built-in fan and rechargeable battery will stay on when the power goes off because it has a built in rechargeable battery.  Please see pictures.<br /><br />The light with built-in fan and rechargeable battery has two buttons.  A fan button and a light button.  First press of the fan button is low speed, then press it again for medium speed, then high speed, and one more press for Off.  The light control is very similar to the fan control button.  First press is on low then next press makes the light go brighter next press brightest and finally a fourth press of the light control button returns the light to power off.<br /><br />This usb powered fanlight with built-in fan and rechargeable battery could also be useful during power outages. This light with built-in fan and rechargeable battery would be good on a desk if you need just a little bit more light and it would be good if the power goes off.  The fan works well and even better if you are closer to it (like at a desk).  Probably a good overlanding, camping and also survival or prepper product.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this usb powered light with built-in fan and rechargeable battery again because it basically matches the seller's description and it was a good deal. This fan grill comes off for cleaning.<br /><br />Thank you so very much for taking the time to read my review on this product and have a wonderful wonderful day!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Miwf7OxrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Miwf7OxrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Miwf7OxrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-3s1vbB7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-3s1vbB7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-3s1vbB7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RPHxZMdbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RPHxZMdbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RPHxZMdbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Sxm95fdfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Sxm95fdfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Sxm95fdfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81c6znUWAXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81c6znUWAXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81c6znUWAXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B095KDN53K,B095KDN53K,AGBCRXQFMGGGYIPS42IJ4Y6JI7OA,2023-04-14 13:17:32.961,0,True,487
467954,3,Design still needs work. OCD beware!,"First off, the print is nice. I think the colors and feel of the material are on point. I believe this product will do it’s intended job of preventing scratches. I will have to update this review later with how long it holds. However, it doesn’t fit right and there will be bubbles/wrinkles.<br /><br />If you have OCD or are otherwise frustrated by things not lining up perfectly, bubbles, etc, this product is not for you. Buy a case, the sticker will never be perfect. It really shows the two tiny specs of something that I tried to remove but couldn’t.<br /><br />The design still needs some work. While this wasn’t awful to install or necessarily difficult, it still can be frustrating due to the fact that not everything is measured correctly. I followed the instructional video and was SUPER careful to not stretch it or tweak it because I desperately wanted it to line up correctly. The back bottom piece is definitely not cut or measured exact. Too short depth wise between top edge, button hole, and charging port, plus the speaker holes are off. The front was almost perfect except for where it meets the lanyard hole. Top pieces are measured fine.<br /><br />The corners. Not a single one laid nice. I understand they’re needed for the curve, but every single one I tried every which way. Smoothing it from the center, smoothing it around the inner or outer curve. They all had wrinkles and didn’t line up. I finally gave up trying to reposition them for fear of messing with their adhesion.<br /><br />I really want to love this product, but it’s just not there yet. 😓 I’ll update after a few weeks of being in my pocket.<br /><br />**UPDATE** 2023, February 25<br />The wrinkles have pretty well ironed out after being in my pocket for weeks. Body heat has helped it slowly secure itself. The overlaps are still there, but it looks a lot smoother. The corners have smoothed out for sure. It has not started peeling and seems like it'll be secure for a long time. If you can get the pieces to line up well, give it a bit in your pocket and it'll be great.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511dyERNodL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511dyERNodL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511dyERNodL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EkxlQu78L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EkxlQu78L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EkxlQu78L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61F1mep8CiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61F1mep8CiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61F1mep8CiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61GMylaI+kL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61GMylaI+kL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61GMylaI+kL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IT+crt6HL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IT+crt6HL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IT+crt6HL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61U+EcdTQOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61U+EcdTQOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61U+EcdTQOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BH56D77T,B0BH56D77T,AFTU74VESNYUIQIS3UHHCUQTAV7A,2023-01-25 01:17:28.091,0,True,487
22400,3,"Requires a subscription, very slow and does not work well with the Echo show","Pros- 1. It's pretty cheap<br />2. Records videos if you pay for the subscription<br />3. Good daytime image quality for such an inexpensive camera<br />4. Easy to arm and disarm, we usually disarm during the day to save battery life. You can also set up zones that won't get triggered like a tree that moves a lot or a roadway.<br />5. Can be hardwired for power. I have two cameras that are close enough to outlets so I plan on getting long cables to run to them that way I will have extra batteries for the one that requires those.<br /><br />Cons- 1. The subscription thing is kind of a scam since they say it will work without one but it really won't. All you can do is look at a live view of a camera but it really isn't a live view since it is so slow you are looking into the past. You cannot record video at all, even to a thumb drive like they say.<br />2. Cameras need to be very close to the house. We have a mesh system so we get great reception but the camera in our garden is like 15 feet from the house and maybe 40 feet from the module and that camera always fails so I will have to move it.<br />3. Generally the entire system is very slow. Live view is around a 10-20 second wait but again it isn't a live view it is a delayed view of 5-6 seconds prior<br />4. You won't ever use it with the Echo show screen because that adds an additional lag of another 10 seconds or so. So the 5 second old video that took 10-20  seconds to show up on your phone will now take an additional 10 seconds to show up on the Echo screen. That was a big bummer, I was really hoping to have a usable video monitor.<br /><br />We initially got this to find out what was eating out of our garden and we did catch it on one video unfortunately that is the camera that always fails so we only have one short video of it. Turns out we have a coyote that eats peppers.  I think we'll keep the system until the batteries go bad and then get a real wired one that you can see live images from and not have the frustration of connection and power issues you get with these wireless systems.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lN2B4CQdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lN2B4CQdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lN2B4CQdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mRxXajZTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mRxXajZTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mRxXajZTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08ZN97SWW,B08ZN97SWW,AE3UEN5HGZBNDQQGS4RNZBAECMUQ,2023-01-26 23:28:38.439,2,True,487
471103,4,Everything you need included; even screen,"Projector came with everything included: besides a basic remote that mirrors the functions of the buttons on the projector, it came with an HDMI and AV cable and much to my surprise the 100cm 16:9 screen.<br /><br />My experience with my first couple of uses is favorable:<br />- Setup was simple:  Plug in, turn on; select projection type from Home, adjust connection settings as needed, focus, watch<br />- the projector had a lens cap, and came with a microfiber cleaning wipe and some Q-tips for dust removal<br />- the remote didn’t have batteries (2 AAA are needed) and was relatively responsive, I kept pointing it at the screen instead of the projector and it still worked<br />-  connected to iPad and Android via Direct-Wi-Fi (they call it the European way WLAN), meaning use of the device built in Wi-Fi signal - no problem setting it up and using it<br />-  the picture was a little bleached but I didn’t bother to go into settings to change the picture quality<br />- one thing I noticed was when using too much of the “Keystone” adjustment, the edges loose sharpness - my TIP, try to set it up with as little Keystone as possible,<br />-  the noise of the fan is noticeable but not distracting; a big plus from an earlier generation projector I had.<br />-  the projector did not heat up and there was no cool down period needed as with older projectors (to preserve the bulb)<br />- the big surprise was the add-on of the screen.  It feels very solid, bright white, wrinkle free material with well placed grommets.  It also came with small plastic hooks and strips but I would likely use Command Strips (tm) if needed.<br /><br />All in all a solid little projector and while it states not suited for PowerPoint etc I still was able to give a slide presentation. - Not perfect but great value.
