"396515","5","Great value","I've used several zip tie guns at work. I tried to save a few bucks and bought a Harbor Freight gun and took it back the next day... junk. I used some that other guys had at work that cost $50.00 and $120.00. They worked awesome. I saw this with the Greenlee logo in the information so I took a chance. The free shipping also was a plus.\\nSo here's my opinion... $18.00 is an excellent price. This tool is all metal and has a solid feel. How does it work? Very well. As a maintenance mechanic I often have to make a temporary repair using a zip tie or two... or three. This little gun cinches the zip tie tight (on the highest setting of 3) and snips of the end almost flush with the lock. I measured the cut end at .050 Inches with my micrometer. The minimal amount left is less than a 64th of an inch and it is smooth! No more tightening zip ties with pliers and cutting off with wire cutters that leave a sharp edge that can cut you wide open.\\nThis is day one and I've used it several times and the rest of the crew had to try it out too so it's done at least 20 zip ties before lunch.\\nIt does all sizes including the heavy duty 1/4 inch ties.\\nHighly recommend this tool. If anything goes bad I will update this review. Just to be fair, i have not used it on the lower settings to wrap a bundle of cables or wires yet.\\nI bought this from American Tools. I give them 5 stars too. Fast free 3 day shipping. It came in a padded envelope that fit in large slot in my locking mailbox. Happy with shipping, happy with the product.\\n\\nUPDATE 3/3/2018 I freaking LOVE this little tool. Iv'e used it hundreds of times and several coworkers have used on a lot of projects. The #3 (highest setting) tightens a 1/4&#34; Zip tie really tight. I used it to hold a sensor on a pneumatic cylinder until a proper stainless steel strap could be delivered. Saved 2 hours of down time. The machine ran with no problems and the sensor didn't move out of place even after 2,500 cycles.  On the lowest setting it works well for bundling delicate wires and hard plastic pneumatic tubing without damaging anything.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71l3UOX9wzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71l3UOX9wzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71l3UOX9wzL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XUvUea1vL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XUvUea1vL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XUvUea1vL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B004YK60YC","B004YK60YC","AF5LDKPQP7KBHCD2JUDSC23SJS7Q","2017-08-07 18:49:13.197","5","True","512"
"81143","5","Even on a older (2009) ""big box mart"" computer, works great! Its a simple upgade!","First off lets look what I'm using this in:  A old Walmart &#34;box&#34; Dell Inspiron 560 computer (2009 era) with the Intel e5400 CPU; 10 Gig Ram, Win10 and stock 300 Watt power supply. This by NO means a powerhouse of a computer.  With the on-board graphics being only good for the most basic of games and videos, we moved to upgrade the video to a Nvidia GT 520 (2011 era). One of the limiting factors with video cards is the power supply in the computer having enough power. Back then the GT 520 fit the bill only requiring 300W. This card worked fine until games became more graphic heavy.\\n\\nPlaying what would be considered &#34;simple single and multi-player games&#34; with my son (he has a gaming computer) was more of a aggravation then enjoyment. Games like; Flight Simulator, Spin Tires, Euro Truck Simulator, Modern Warfare 2 (all on Steam) would suffer along on only the lowest of settings.\\n\\nWell this Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1050 has changed all that. Now these games are running smooth and quick. It's like having a whole new computer, even with the lacking &#34;CPU&#34; power. With the Video settings on High, I'm now &#34;booking&#34; on all my games and simulators!\\n\\nThe GTX 1050 requires only 300W power so no issues there. It does take the space of an extra slot in the back out your PC case, but does push right in to the board with no extra wiring. The fans are quite when the run.\\n\\nI currently run two monitors, one on HDMI and one with the DVI-D (using a converter to VGA). There is a DP (display port) connector for my third monitor Ill be getting soon.\\n\\nSo far the only lacking is the Utility Program - kinda slow to open but does have different settings you can play this like over-clocking, fan speed, etc.\\n\\nAll in all, this is a great card for the price and a perfect upgrade for a older computer.\\n\\n[[ASIN:B01MG0733A Gigabyte Geforce GTX 1050 2GB GDDR5 128 Bit PCI-E Graphic Card (GV-N1050OC-2GD)]]","[]","B01MG0733A","B01MSNCDTA","AFLAWWHQ2AV77ZWGY4VFQYDNI7ZQ","2017-11-29 03:52:34.050","12","True","512"
"931887","3","Nice universal mounting tech, decent keyboard, but keyboard/tablet slide around inside closed case.","So the good news is that, unlike several other reviewers, I've had no problem with the keys repeating. The keyboard works beautifully, and while I'd prefer more of a slope instead of the totally flat layout, it's a good keyboard with decently-sized and well-spaced keys. Many of these sorts of keyboard cases give you tiny keys or are far too cramped for decent typing. The Universal Folio doesn't make those mistakes.\\n\\nGetting my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 into the folio wasn't a problem, and it does indeed hold the tablet in place firmly. The mounting tech is solid, easy to use, and seems reliable. Where I ran into trouble was when I went to close the case and found that it sort of slides around freely. Even with the elastic strap holding it closed, it's not a very secure closure. The tablet is meant to lock into place when the mounting brackets on the bottom slot into some indentations on the keyboard surface, but they're not very deep and they don't so much &#34;lock&#34; as just sit in those grooves loosely. That means that your screen is sort of rubbing against the keyboard every once in a while, and I find this less than ideal. They needed to put something on the corners to prevent this.\\n\\nI really wanted to give this a four-star review, but the more I tried carrying my tablet around in this case the more the sliding happened. It's not making me feel like this is protective at all, and in fact might damage your screen. Yes, it gives you a keyboard for your tablet but it really falls short in the realm of protection.\\n\\nI adore Logitech products, and I expected better from them. This folio has a great universal mounting technology, but the idea isn't complete. Until they figure out a better, more reliable way to keep the tablet and keyboard from sliding around against each other when the folio is closed, this case unfortunately deserves the three-star review I've given it. With all due respect, Logitech, this design needs to go back to the drawing board.\\n\\nIf you are just looking for a way to turn an extra tablet into a laptop that you don't intend to carry around, this will do the trick. If you're looking for a protective keyboard-folio that can go everywhere with you, you may want to wait for a future version. Three stars.","[]","B06XJ6ZGZK","B06XJ6ZGZK","AHPJHWUFX7DFIVS5B3XNEK7JLSAQ","2017-05-28 17:30:06.000","0","False","512"
"102316","5","Amazing value, beast of a gaming machine, great cord management","I play too much Rocket League. I started on PS4, then moved to play on my iMac 5k. I wanted to play at 144hz, and also get a Windows machine for gaming, so I started looking into my options. I looked into Alienware but those would have been $500 more for the same specs with a sufficient power supply/cooling system. EVERYONE says &#34;build your own machine.&#34; I'm great with computers, work as a programmer, have upgraded and modified countless things on countless computers, but I've never built one from the ground up.\\n\\nWhen pricing out all of the parts as opposed to just buying the machine itself, I could have saved maybe $100. Seriously. And for that $100 I would have to do all of work, be responsible for any bricking issues, and order like 10 different things instead of one.\\n\\nI just wanted to play more Rocket League, so I decided to buy a pre-built machine. This computer was basically a custom-built PC that someone else with better wire management skills builds for you. All of the pre-built gaming machine companies get mixed reviews (Cyberpower, iBuyPower, etc), so I felt a bit risky, but I bought it anyway. I seriously could not be happier with the CyberpowerPC, and would 100% buy from them again.\\n\\nThe components themselves are top notch, it has a sufficient power supply and cooling system (which isn't common for the price point), runs almost all games on ultra settings, and will be super easy to upgrade once it starts getting dated. The packaging and box was almost Apple-like, high quality and easy to deal with. Everything is preinstalled (besides a few drivers I had to update) so it worked right out of the box with no issue. The LED lights are gimmicky but every gaming PC seems to have those.\\n\\nThe only complaint I've had so far is the headphone jack on the top of the case is wonky, super hard to plug in or take out a plug. I just got a USB headset instead and that solved the problem. Oh and the included keyboard is super loud because it's mechanical. But seriously, those two nitpicks don't matter at all.\\n\\nMaybe in the future I'll build a machine from the ground up for fun, but CyberPower 100% gets my recommendation.","[]","B01MT0792S","B01N6QV8Z6","AG2PBIU3PQUQ3DZD46UDTRJNWZGA","2017-07-13 16:14:30.032","0","False","512"
"778733","5","Great remote, great iOS app - with note re Apple TV Gen 4","Setup:  Samsung 55&quot; Smart TV (I don't using any of the smart features since my Apple TV has better versions), VIzio 55&quot; soundbar, Arris cable box; Apple TV Gen4; old Phillips DVD player.  TV, soundbar and Apple TV are on wifi and the remote automatically found and added them.  Setting up the others simply required entering the model name/number.  Basic setup for Watch TV, Watch Apple TV and Play Movie (DVD) was done automatically by the Harmony - I just needed to specify which inputs on the TV and soundbar to use for different activities - and so far (about a month later) they've all worked flawlessly.\\n\\nNote re Apple TV:  I still use its remote for most functions since the Harmony doesn't have Siri or a touch screen.  Not a big deal at all, and volume can be controlled by either the Harmony or the Apple remote, so when using the Apple TV I don't really need the Harmony for anything other than to start the activity.  If you don't care about Siri, you could use the Harmony for all ATV functions.\\n\\nNote on placement:  my cable box and apple tv are in one section of a wood entertainment cabinet and the dvd player is in a separate section.  TV and soundbar are above the cabinet, with soundbar blocking the TV's remote sensor.  I put the included IR blaster in the section with Apple TV and cable box and it controls both easily, wherever it's placed.  The signal couldn't reach the DVD player in a separate part of the cabinet, but I put the hub (surprisingly small) on top of it - perfect.  I bought an extra IR mini blaster placed it on top of the soundbar, near the TV sensor and it controls both perfectly.  So my weird setup took a bit of time to figure out ideal placement, but this is not the fault of the Harmony.\\n\\nI also love the iOS app.  Although I agree it's not very intuitive, it's not hard to figure out.  It makes it very easy to access less common commands for all of the components and has a very cool &quot;favorites&quot; screen for TV/cable box channels.  And its screen for the Vizio soundbar is about a thousand times easier to use than the soundbar's own remote or app.","[]","B00N3RFC4G","B00O4RRHP6","AFRQNK6EOGNRKXPY5OEVVVN6P5GQ","2017-06-28 17:34:14.591","0","True","512"
"159459","5","After many different Bluetooth receivers, this one is the one that works as needed.","My car does not have Bluetooth audio but it does have a very good stereo with an AUX input. I bought numerous small Bluetooth receivers to try to get something that was satisfactory. The biggest problem most of them had was that you had to press a button to turn them on after not being in the car for a while. Plus, many would not auto power on when hooked up to power. Some even did not work while charging. This is most annoying since I don't like clutter in the car and was hoping to install them under the dash and out of sight.\\n\\nThis HomeSpot receiver does not have those problems. It does not have a battery and turns on when power is supplied. It remembers the paired devices and just works. I get into the car and the pairing is done before I can shift into gear.\\n\\nAnother problem many of the devices had was poor audio quality - well, I should say subpar since they were good but not up to the level of the stereo or my good headphones. This receiver does a very good job. Maybe it is the power supply design or the fact it is nearly the latest in Bluetooth standard that makes it so good, but it really does a great job.\\n\\nFor a car or even home stereo setup, this is wonderful as once you do the first pairing, it just works every time. No more hassle. I was able to install this completely out of sight and in a permanent mount for a rattle free and clutter free car interior.\\n\\nI have not used the power adapter or the wires that come with the device as I have my own, perfectly sized connections and USB power source. (I recommend a good, isolated power source to prevent ground loops nod hum from the otherwise noisy car electrical environment.)\\n\\nI wish I would have found this one before having ordered and tried some many others.\\n\\nPS - This used to be available under a different product link at Amazon and I reviewed it there and now that link no longer includes the receiver (it was a product option).  This is the same receiver but a different bundle of accessories with it.\\n\\nhttps://smile.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22GGT471B5ZJJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MRI5OVQ","[]","B009OBCAW2","B009OBCAW2","AF2NEZE3YHACQGOUOVN3F4ALMLMA","2017-03-09 19:55:49.000","0","False","512"
"664804","3","Not a great mouse, but will do in a pinch and ...","Not a great mouse, but will do in a pinch and it's easy to travel with.\\n\\nThere is no dongle/receiver to worry about since this mouse is Bluetooth and depends on the host device already having Bluetooth capabilities.\\n\\nThe tracking of the mouse seems on par with any other good-quality mouse. It is not a super-high-rez gaming mouse but it is better than a lot of the cheaper travel mice on the market.\\n\\nThe unique things about this mouse are two-fold: the bending feature and the two-dimensional touch scrolling feature.\\n\\nThe bending feature is slick. It works as advertised and it is a fairly comfortable mouse to hold. That being said, the force require to push the buttons is optimized by having finger tips that are placed toward the front end of the mouse instead of being able to click anywhere on the touch surface.\\n\\nSpeaking of the touch surface, it does away with physically separate left and right buttons. Instead the mouse detects which side your finger is clicking with. This is confused a little bit if you have fingers resting on both sides which will default to a left click. This means that you need to make sure you're only clicking with one finger on the right side to get a proper response. There is no center button functionality.\\n\\nThe scrolling feature works but isn't implemented as well as some other touch scrolling devices like trackpads. The scrolling isn't always smooth and there is no inertial effect. There is also no haptic feedback on the scrolling feature like there was with previous models of the Arc Touch mouse. When compared to the scrolling performance of other premium input devices like the Apple Magic Mouse 2 or Magic Trackpad, the Surface Arc Mouse is inferior. Of course, this mouse is optimized for Windows while Apple's is optimized for Macs but the comparison is still possible.\\n\\nThe touch surface also lacks any support for gestures beyond the simple horizontal and vertical scrolling. This includes a lack of support for taps instead of clicks.This is unfortunate as the touch area is relatively large and could benefit from some additional capabilities.\\n\\nOverall, this mouse compliments the Microsoft Surface and other Windows systems fairly well and it's real selling points are its ability to collapse to an easily transported flat form factor and use of Bluetooth instead of a proprietary wireless dongle but don't expect the touch scrolling feature to blow you away.","[]","B071DTNNL7","B083L4239G","AHHS4VQSPXM4V6LZFWUVQ3HUVYOA","2017-08-24 19:48:01.553","7","False","512"

I know it'll get better as time goes on, but it's a bit rough around the edges right now.\\n\\n* Show to Show calling is quite nice - calling across the house and to my friend's house was done flawlessly. The video was at the quality of our Skype and Facetime conversations. But backlit rooms? Forget it - it's hard to see the other person (or for them to see you.)\\n* The display is quite nice and playing videos from Amazon Video was easy but a bit awkward. The screen is as good as the entry level Fire tablet.\\n* Having said that, there's no skills/apps that take advantage of the screen quite yet, so it's nice to look at but not really functional quite yet. I can show my photos from my Amazon account, and manually set wallpaper from the app on the phone, but the out of box experience might let you down.\\n* The Alexa implementation for right now is a bit weak. For example, I can't say &#34;Alexa, play The Americans&#34; without it going to search for music. Same with looking up Youtube. That was a bit rough.\\n* The speakers are amazing - I was kind of surprised at how good the quality was when playing music at full volume (sorry, neighbors) with no real distortion. It's no Bose speaker but it works.\\n* Getting this to work as my bedside alarm clock is easy - you can say &#34;do not disturb&#34; when you're ready for bed, and you have to set the &#34;do not disturb&#34; time from the app if you want it scheduled.\\n* There is a lot of nostalgia, especially if you had a Chumby or a Sony Dash.\\n* There's no USB ports, so you can't use this to charge your phone. Makes sense.\\n\\nOverall I like it - this will take the place of the bedside Echo Dot while that gets repurposed around the house. For right now, this is a fancier version of the Dot, but it will improve over time as developers take advantage of the screen, and feedback steers the development from Amazon's side. Come the holidays, this should magnitudes better. For right now, 3.5 stars.","[]","B01J24C0TI","B01KIOU4EO","AEMQYBTZ4X6JE2X4XBUK5CB2UH2A","2017-06-30 04:16:58.422","4","True","512"
"171179","4","Just got them plus update","Just giving 4 star because by selecting 4 star Amazon says that I like it and a 5 star says I love it. I literally just opened the package. It's very light weight, when I plug it in a red charging light comes on which is great. I hope that it turns green when it is fully charged. I got the different size rubber? tips (small, medium, large) and a set of one size foam tips. There are only three buttons on it. One for answering a phone call and two for volume. I'm hoping that maybe holding down a button will let me skip a song. I wear glasses and if I place the temples of my glasses (strange word for that part of them, google glasses anatomy) over the headphone thing that wraps around my ears it feels ok. I guess it might even help hold them against my head better. Will update after it charges.\\n\\nUPDATE: 16 days later\\nThey work great, the bass is much better than I thought it was going to be. The LED light that turns red when charging turns blue when it is fully charged. If you double tap the volume up or volume down buttons the song skips forwards or backwards. the top phone button pauses and plays the song. There are other button combo options, but I don't have the manual in front of me. If you hold the volume up and down buttons together it will cycle through three types of EQ preferences. The only two I remember are treble and bass focused options. The charge holds for a long time, I haven't got a low battery yet. When you power up the headphones a woman's voice will say &#34;Power on battery high (if fully charged) and &#34;Power off&#34; if done again. I do a lot of physical work, so I sweat a lot, but the headphones stay clean and not grimy. They hold well on my head and I can still wear them well when one side is out of my ear. I can wear them without a problem on my neck, but when I am hot and sweaty I don't like them on there, but that's with anything. I am still very impressed with the quality. I still don't think they are worth the over $129 and I feel like even when they were on sale for $27 that was just some tactic to make me want to buy them faster. They are holding up very well and I only recommend them when they are under $50.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7134DIDOzEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7134DIDOzEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7134DIDOzEL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7185Rk+t5eL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7185Rk+t5eL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7185Rk+t5eL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01C22IJV0","B01MR1X6ZU","AHZSXV5AB3J3N7M3ELNTNN3M6Q5A","2017-07-13 21:54:53.227","6","True","512"

This camera was SUPER easy to install.  To give a basic run down of installation, here is all it took:\\n1)  Take your license plate off, and bolt the camera to the back of the license plate.\\n2)  Remove the tail light you prefer.  I did the driver's side tail light, since I knew the wiring on that side of the dash better.\\n3)  Identify the positive and negative wires running to your reverse light.  Attach these two wires to your red and black wires on the camera.\\n4)  Run the video cable along the bottom of the vehicle, ensuring that you zip tie or attach to the frame at non-moving or rubbing parts.\\n5)  Find a place to pass into the cabin of the vehicle.  On my truck, there is a rubber grommet for other wires under the kick plate on the drivers side.\\n6)  Running the video cable behind the kick panel on the driver's side, then up into the dash, the cable should be long enough to reach the stereo\\n7)  On my truck, I am using a double din pioneer head unit.  Mine has a place to plug the video camera cable into the stereo.  If you don't have a head unit with video input, you will need to attach it to whatever monitor you have.\\n8)  On my stereo, there is a purple wire that you attach to the red wire that comes from the camera.

It is a super simple process of snipping one wire.\\n\\nThe image is really nice and clear, and uses a fish-eye so it shows a really large amount of image for such a small camera.  The camera is adjustable in all directions and uses a really sturdy bracket.\\nMy plate has a decorative frame around it, and the bracket supports the camera over the decorative frame with no problem.\\n\\nAll in all, I am really happy with this camera.

"799029","5","Solid battery life; comfortable wear and secure fit","I've been on a lookout for true wireless buds ever since they first got introduced, but all of the products out on the markets today had too many compromises. Whether it was battery, connectivity, or comfortability, I couldn't find any true wireless buds that checked all of the checkboxes I wanted; that is, until the IconX 2018. While the IconX does have its cons still, it was the best earbuds that matched up well with the Apple AirPods.\\n\\nThoughts:\\n1) These have a 5 hour battery life with an extra 5 hours in the case itself; with my experience so far, I've had no issue reaching that mark. The issues with the old IconX was that it only had 1.5 hours in the buds, which was abysmal. Samsung finally fixed that issue here. Compared to the extra 24 hours that the AirPods get with their charger, these might not be as great, but a total of 10 hours on the IconX is perfectly fine with me.\\n\\n2) The fit on these buds are great. I have extremely small ear canals, and most in-ear earbuds hurt after some time. The IconX 2018 I can actually wear for 2-3 hours without feeling much discomfort. I might have to readjust them once in awhile, but I didn't feel the need to take a break from them once. They fit very securely too; whether running or lifting at the gym, I haven't once felt like they were going to fall off.\\n\\n3) These earbuds are very discreet. Unlike the other ones on the market (Bose and Apple, I'm looking at you), these buds don't stick out very prominently, which I really appreciate.\\n\\nCons:\\nThe touch gestures are a little wonky and can register incorrect gestures. I've had moments where it wouldn't skip the song or where it would pause when I didn't want it to.\\n\\nThough it doesn't happen very often, there have been moments where the earbuds will disconnect for a second and reconnect to each other immediately. When this happens, there is a brief static noise when it reconnects and I've noticed it happening maybe once or twice every workout. I haven't owned any other true wireless buds, so this may be a connectivity issue with any true wireless buds, but I can't say for certain.","[]","B07644ZS1D","B076K6QXF5","AGA3TZ6743FJKZOCFGQTQANR22NA","2017-12-06 06:33:24.668","1","False","512"
"712814","4","A good GPS so far but jury is still out.","I am coming off being a Magellan Roadmate user. It was fine, accurate, quick to indicate turns but Magellan stopped making good on it's promise to give lifetime free map upgrades, unless they meant the lifetime of a gnat. After nearly two years of no map upgrades and getting fed answers as 'this is the latest map and we haven't received the latest maps from our source' and then missing exits that were new but not on my maps I finally gave up and bought a new GPS. But not a Magellan. I got this Garmin Nuvi 57LM. It upgraded the maps the first time I ran its desktop software. The first few times I used the Garmin it compelled me to repeatedly agree to its terms of use, several layers of terms, in fact. Finally it settled down and now it only warns me not to input addresses while the car is in motion. The last time I didn't respond and after a few seconds it went to the home screen. The address input is natural. It asks for the street number then street name and then tries to guess what state and city your address is near. That is closer to how you write out an address. Magellan started off asking the city, street name then street number which always seemed backwards and sometimes I didn't immediately know what the city was. Garmin's navigation is accurate but it doesn't chime when you reach the turn like Magellan did. I miss that and it makes me have to look at the screen more to make sure I don't miss the turn. It has all the 'save addresses that are frequent' features and in a format that is easy to access. However, some off-road lanes do not show. The Magellan showed all the lanes and loop roads of the complex I live in but Garmin does not and so the car icon just floats in empty space till it reaches the satellite coordinates of the circle drive in front of the apartment complex I live in. All in all, I do think the Garmin was a good buy. I just wish it had some of the nicer touches of the Magellan. But, Hey, at least I've got a GPS with free map upgrades for the lifetime of a roach this time!\\n\\nSo, Magellan-I hope you are reading this! You have a great way of treating your customers so that they would never buy a Magellan again. I just hope Garmin is reading this also and tries to treat customers better so that they feel like returning as customers.","[]","B017L1QGU8","B017L1QGU8","AEYYYMNW2BIPQBFNBC4MTHGI3UTA","2017-07-18 19:49:27.599","11","True","512"
"417852","2","Not what I thought I was getting...","As others has said, this cassette deck is not really what one would expect from a respected name like Marantz. Sure, it does play cassette tapes and can record to new cassettes (if you have any of those lying around). But the main reason I purchased this unit was to be able to play music from my ancient cassettes that have irreplaceable material from the past. (Yes, stuff recorded before most readers were born, back in the 70s and 80s). I realize that some of it is hardly &#34;audiophile&#34; quality, but it should still be listenable, right?\\n\\nThe problem with the PMD-300CP is that it severely limits you in terms of both noise reduction and playback bias. For example, you cannot select Dolby B or C noise reduction settings for cassettes originally recorded using these older technologies. I also was unable to specifically select the newer Dolby HX (although I don't have much material encoded this way). Similarly, in terms of playback bias, this machine does allow you to switch between &#34;Normal&#34; and &#34;CrO2&#34;, but I found neither sounded particularly clear or faithful to the originals. The unit also seems to be poorly constructed; one doesn't get the impression it will last very long because it is lightweight and has a cheap, &#34;plastic-y&#34; feel.\\n\\nIn fairness to Marantz, it has been a while since I listened to some of the cassette tapes I tried in the PMD-300CP and my ears might now be firmly accustomed to listening to fairly antiseptic &#34;digital&#34; sound. The system I now use to listen to music is significantly more accurate and powerful than the setup I proudly owned in my first apartment, and thus reveals more in terms of detail as well as flaws. But I have to share with any perspective buyer that if like me, you are purchasing the PMD-300CP to play your old cassette tapes, you are likely to be disappointed. You will probably not consider what you get out of this unit anything like what you remember hearing from your old hi-fi system. (That is in some cases, perhaps a good thing... :-) I'll probably end up putting this unit in a bedroom or office for &#34;casual&#34; listening, and keep looking for a better unit...","[]","B01EYKBNYS","B01EYKBNYS","AGGVR6PWXCJ7EKSLMUZP7CQPUZYQ","2017-07-09 17:48:53.263","92","True","512"
"199059","5","Used on akg k550","I have the first version of the k550 and it it's very light on bass, it extends down very low but has always been lacking in quantity. Going from like new stock pads to these xl cow hide pads makes a huge difference, these finally sound like the closed headphone I've been looking for. They really show how much potential these have always had locked up inside them. The differences I hear going back and forth a few times is an immediately noticeable bump in the bass from down extremely low, impressively low, to up higher giving a much appreciated kick. The mid range and treble sound about like they did before but since these pads are so much better at creating a seal around your ears and also are made of a much denser material than the stock pleather pads, they end up giving much better isolation and give the sound that different material to absorb and reflect off of you end up with more body and depth. The same goes for the soundstage, it just improves a little all around. I was worried before I tried these out, I thought since they were a deeper pad and with a bigger opening that they would bring your ear further away from the driver and reflect to much highs and mess up the imaging and possibly even decrease bass, I've heard these things happen before when swapping pads but it was just simply not the case here. I highly suggest trying these you can always return them Amazon is amazing like that but you won't I cannot say how the pleather version of these xl pads would be but I would guess they would do a similar thing but not to the same extent, and these natural soft leathers being used in the higher end pads can even help with reflection making a headphone sound more linear and cohesive and I think that is definitely happening here as well. There a bargain actually to I just bought these and 3 pairs of dekoni's more elite series pads 2 fenestrated sheep skin and a velour, they were $70 for the sheep skin and I honestly feel like these brainwavz pads are perhaps a little better but they were all for different headphones so it's hard to say. What is easy to say though is that these are definitely worth a shot and there price give them a try.\\n\\nI tried these on my akg k340 as well and seems about the same thing is going on as with the k550 but to a lesser extent but still absolutely zero complaints. They also help get a better seal with both of these headphones which was very needed.","[]","B076SLL6BK","B076SHF8LV","AFUDH7YGX4ZNHBRXNJCKUBDK7LRQ","2017-12-25 10:24:09.208","14","True","512"
"26833","4","I'm not jumping up & down, but I really do like this unit","Very high-quality image. I'm a little disappointed in a few things, but first, the positives:\\n\\n++ Clear viewing.  It's certainly not high definition, but for the most part it's like you're right there watching. And, you quickly get past the mild &#34;fish eye&#34; from viewing 180 degrees because you know what you're looking at.\\n\\n++ Audio!  Not only can you look in, you can listen in, too. All things considered, the sound is pretty good, too.\\n\\n++ Infrared (night) vision is clear -- within a reasonable distance, anyway. If what you're looking at is 10 - 12 feet away, you can see it, even in the dark. That said, if you're trying to see things in the dark that are 20+ feet away, it's going to disappoint.\\n\\nOn to the downsides:\\n\\n-- Getting the camera to connect through WiFi caused a mild spike in blood pressure. It's supposed to work right away, and I was thinking, &#34;Is this going to be a dud?&#34;  Thankfully, the stars eventually aligned and it worked.  Don't give up.  Besides, there's a toll-free number you can call if you need help.\\n\\n-- No way to &#34;mount&#34; this camera on a wall.  I was hoping to mount this out-of-reach, up in the corner of a room, but to do that I'd need to find some way to otherwise support it. The unit is designed to sit flat somewhere. If someone sees it sitting out and doesn't want to be recorded, all they have to do is turn the unit around!  That said, the unit is relatively small, and it doesn't jump up and scream &#34;I'm a camera!&#34; So it earns a point back for discreetness.\\n\\n-- The app is not what I would call user-friendly. They could use more input on the design team for this to be a little more intuitive.\\n\\nOverall, I really like this unit.  I'm not jumping up and down in love with it, but I really do like it. And, for the price point, its' a good deal. Four stars.","[]","B06XGSNQ7S","B06XGSNQ7S","AGTD4QXNKMEIUIQQYOULVZF222JA","2017-10-21 02:09:12.939","1","False","512"

"284913","5","Tough to beat at this price point, a very good mATX mini tower.","This is a great budget mATX case. The internal layout is good, with a removable 3.5&#34; drive cage, dedicated mounts for two 2.5&#34; SSDs, decent cable management options and the ability to mount up to five 120mm cooling fans. The cabling for the front audio and USB ports are sleeved and have plenty of length to reach the far opposite corner of any mATX motherboard. The build quality is very good, although not perfect, no major complaints considering the price. The side panels could use ever so slightly thicker gauge steel and the 3.5 drive cage is a bit flimsy as well, but everything is perfectly functional. The front bezel is filtered from top to bottom and easily snaps out without any interference with the power button or front USB ports, making it easy to take outside and blow clean if any dust collects on the filter. The bottom vent for the PSU also has a removable filter, a nice touch for a case in this price range. I also really like the looks of the case as well... clean and simple but not boring... doesn't look like an alien cyborg egg that fell off a spaceship.\\n\\nI used this case for a budget gaming PC for the son of a friend, so it didn't have a ton of super high powered components. I added a 120mm fan to the front face, to add some positive air pressure to the case and to keep dust intake at the front panel where the filter will grab it. Using only the supplied rear exhaust fan might lead to dust being sucked in from gaps in the bottom and the vents on top. As far as GPU, my build used a smaller 1050ti but I believe this case would easily accept any dual-fan GPU. If you aren't using any 3.5&#34; drives, the cage can be removed to offer more room for cables / airflow. I left the cage installed in my build, using it as essentially a storage shed for the extra cables from the non-modular PSU. That said, the internal area seems roomy for mini tower and I never felt cramped working in the space.\\n\\nFor a mATX PC on a tight budget, you can do a whole lot worse than this case. I would easily recommend it. Thermaltake always seems to deliver on these inexpensive cases that aren't &#34;cheap&#34;. Great features and very good quality for the price.","[]","B01CLIZ698","B08LK36L7H","AEJGV7MTCYAWBVVCT24PE2W2TR7Q","2017-08-04 12:09:22.254","2","True","512"

But that is good enough for me.\\n\\nI did use the AirPods for calls in my iPhone which worked great.  I used the Apollo 7's on my tablet watching TV, so I did not get to make a call with them so I can't speak to call quality.\\n\\nAfter research and purchasing a lot of headphones, I would say that the Apollo 7's are the only true competitor of the AirPods.  I would give the edge to the AirPods for their super ease of use and simplicity.  Apple just thinks of everything like if you decide to listen with only one earpiece, you can take one out it just shuts it off.  The Apollo makes you put both back in the case and take one out.  The AirPods never have fallen out of my ear on their own.  I have knocked them out taking a sweatshirt off or hitting them with my hand.  However, the Apollo's feel far more secure if you are exercising. If you are that anti apple person, you won't be disappointed if you can fork over the money for the Apollo's.  I will keep them both but most likely use the AirPods far more.","[]","B01LPFO73E","B01LYC5NFM","AE337IIGCPQPTWW7NC5RIKUAIOTA","2017-01-24 01:01:24.000","16","True","512"

The pillow is very stiff, and provides little to no comfort when used as a head pillow or as the lumbar pillow.\\n\\nThe product is manufactured or assembled in China and opens the doors for concern.  The connection material used in the assembly of this chair such as the nuts and bolts as well as the rivets are known items of safety concern in the industry.

"979487","1","Does not do what it needs to do to be effective.","I bought the Tile Mate a little over a year ago as it had many good reviews and seemed to be the best product in its class.  Initially I thought it was a good purchase.  I was able to test the locator and had fun hiding the tile around the house and letting my daughters try to find it.  That is where the positives ended.  In order for a finder to work properly it should be reliable and react quickly to a request to find either the tile itself or the phone to which it is supposed to be connected.  A month or so after I had set up the tile and linked it to my phone I misplaced my keys.  I knew they were in the house but not exactly where, great I thought, this is exactly why I bought a tile.  I opened my phone and requested it to ring the tile in question, the phone gave me the little spinning wait indication and told me that my tile was nearby and was currently being connected to the phone.  After a minute or so of this I resumed my manual search and was finally able to locate my keys.  This scenario repeated itself several more times until I finally gave up and just removed the tile from my key chain.  The reverse action was also not useful.  When I had both the phone and the tile in my possession and had recently connected them and made sure they were talking properly I was able to push the button on the tile and my phone rang.  That is great but when I have actually misplaced my phone and am trying to locate it the results were not very useful.  I would walk around my house pushing the button on the tile hoping to hear my phone ringing.  Not once of the two or three times that I tried this did my phone ring.  I could be 5 feet away and push the button and no ring.  When I did locate my phone, reconnect the tile and then push the button the phone rang but that is not why I bought the device.  I don't need my phone to ring when I have both my phone and the tile in my hands I need the phone to ring when it is lost.\\n\\nI really wanted to like this device and my initial tests were positive but in the end this device does not do what I purchased it to do, locate my keys and/or my phone.

When it Works","The dash cam itself is great. 1440p 30fps is really clear and you can see details like license plate numbers very well, even at night. 1080p 60fps is quite smooth and I might even use this dash cam to shoot some scenic drives. I like the wedge design as it's very discrete, although it might get hotter than other mounting designs because it's right up against the windshield for optimal conductive heating.\\n\\nOk now the bad. a few days after installation, the cam started to randomly turn off and turn back on. This continued as the frequency increased. I checked my power source and everything was fine. Then I discovered that it that the GPS mount causing the problem. the connection between the cam and the mount is very unstable, behaving as if the mount is unable to provide enough power to the cam until it shuts off and then power on again. I was considering contacting SpyTec about this issue and then I read quite a few comments on here detailing how unhelpful they were, so I didn't want to waste my time. I switched to the regular mount for the time being.\\n\\nTHEN, immediately after switching to the regular mount, the firmware started to have major problems, as if to spite me. It's had a couple minor issues out of the box but were not to inconvenient. For example sometimes after you change a few settings in the menu the cam would revert back to the previous settings as soon as you exit the menu. I don't change the settings much so it wasn't too much of an issue. But now, it won't even record, I can't access the menu, none of the buttons work, and the hard reset button doesn't do anything either. So I eventually just re-flashed it with Viofo's firmware. Now it runs fine.\\n\\nI know this is a budget dash cam so I shouldn't be expecting too much, but these problems are pretty major. It's caused me some stress trying to get it to work. An considering how many 5-star positive reviews this product has, I wanted to let people know of some potential problems that you may encounter. I will try to get SpyTec to replace the GPS mount, but if the issue is with the main dash cam then it might be difficult to get the v2 when it's out. It's still a nice dash cam. I hope this is the end of its problems and I can drive around stress-free.","[]","B01HN0HBFG","B01HN0HBFG","AGG4EQNFFAON2XJK3XTMUJEG6COA","2017-04-21 17:58:36.000","5","True","512"

It generally takes a few hours of use for earbuds to show their final sound characteristics.  Nice volume range.  I use them on a treadmill, and the cord is pretty good at staying where I want it around the back of my neck with the adjustment clip that comes with it.  Other similar earbuds tend to pull out of one ear or the other as the cord pulls around.  The ear stabilization flanges that came with them work pretty well, although they were installed on the wrong ears as shipped.  Buyers might want to check that before use. I tend to keep my sessions to under two hours and charge them by habit every other day, so I can't vouch for the battery life claimed by the manufacturer.  I was a bit disappointed to find that I could not pair two devices to these earbuds (a Mac and an iPhone) at the same time.  Following the included directions just wiped out the first pairing when I paired the second device.  Not a deal killer, but most earbuds now allow this.\\n\\nLost a start...\\nFollow-up a couple of months later:  Still great bass and excellent sound, but there's a fly in the soup.  The headset occasionally powers off without warning, and without the usual power down beep.  The lack of that beep tells me it's not an inadvertent button push, but rather an internal flaw.  I still use them to play music, but using them for phone calls is problematic.  On a phone call, all of a sudden the other person on the call starts coming through the speaker, and if the phone is in my pocket, well...  As a result, I don't take calls through the headset and swipe the screen to use just the phone.  I think they were worth the $14 I paid on the lightning deal, but $28 is probably a stretch unless you're really impressed with high quality music sound.  The $100 list price is pure fantasy on the part of the manufacturer.\\n\\nJuly update:  Lost another star.  They went dead less than four months after purchase due to battery failure.  This is a real shame, because the sound was really good.  I can't say they were worth even the bargain basement price I paid.","[]","B01MQOECP0","B07CND5Y4J","AHC4EOWHQZKTLT7MMWHSNRY66YQQ","2017-04-22 01:52:10.000","0","False","512"

However, whenever I went to place my order they didn't have it in stock and wouldn't for a couple of weeks. Seeing as how i was building a Gaming rig from scratch, I just couldn't see having a tower sitting there for two weeks with no gaming capability at all. This popped up and at the time it was only $100 more than the 1070 I had saved in my cart. I'm glad amazon was out of stock now.\\n\\nI play some pretty graphic heavy games.(Ark, Metal gear solid TPP, Rainbow 6 Siege, just to name a few) and I had been playing on an asus laptop with a 970M GPU. I could barely play ark on a modified &#34;high&#34; setting. I had to lower several of the more detailed options manually. But this GPU... I have it running on epic with only &#34;Sky quality&#34; lowered to about half(and thats mainly because it can cause too much of a visual glare like looking into the sun) Now I haven't checked an actual FPS counter, But I can tell you I have no screen tearing, no lagging, no glitches! I run at 1920x1080 Borderless window mode and This thing can handle Ark with a breeze.\\n\\nUsing Asus Gpu Tweak II app found on their website I was able to create a custom profile using the base stock overclock preset and ramping up fan power that runs the GPU at 102%power at around 60 to 64 degree(Celsius) while playing Ark.\\n\\nWhen playing Rainbow 6 Siege with a friend, I ran the in game benchmark and was getting 250+FPS(not sure how accurate it is). It was quite impressive.\\n\\nAnd finally i use Uniging Heaven Benchmark to put a massive stress test on this GPU. I am happy to say that on the higest possible settings, It ran between 95-120 FPS without ANY Issues at all!\\n\\nI may buy a second and run SLI one day but for now, This graphics Card has NO DOWNSIDES!!!. The RGB lighting isn't overkill either. I have an Asus z270F motherboard and using the asus Aura app syncs all the RGB LEDs up flawlessly and easily I just can't say enough about this GPU.

"337644","1","Buy this warranty if you enjoy being kept endlessly on hold and like waiting a month for your PC to be unsuccessfully repaired.","Never, ever, repeat EVER buy a warranty from this company.  My computer broke 3 weeks ago and, to be fair, I was quickly put in touch with a repair facility and told that a new power supply would be sent to my house and a technician would follow to install it.  After a week, no part had arrived, and no follow on call from the technician.  I called the Square-trade office and complained.  I was told, don't worry, we will send you a check for the full value of the computer (over $2000) within 2-3 days. After 3 days I still hadn't received any check or advice on how to claim it.  I then emailed them and was told by Hasan, the Square Trade Care Specialist, who, as it turns out doesn't really care at all, that &#34;After reviewing your claim number 062178131139 I can see that, the case is already in the process of issuing you a check for the laptop price.&#34;  I received that gem from Hasan on 17 Feb.  Its now 27th of February and guess what....  still no check.  When I phoned them to ask where the hell it could be now, I was told they are waiting on the repair facility to contact them.  That's right, the same bloody repair facility that didn't send the part or the technician. When I asked why they were waiting on the word of these subcontractors who were proven as unreliable, I was condescendingly told that I wasn't aware of their procedures and that someone would be in touch. If, despite my advice to not purchase this warranty, you still feel like going ahead, consider this:  I told Squaretrade that this is a computer that I run my home business from.  I repeatedly told them that I needed it to be repaired so I could keep up with my customers projects.  They simply DONT care that I am losing business over this.  Do yourself a favor and purchase the warranty elsewhere.  Anywhere but with these guys.  They'll just let you down when the chips are down.  Having had enough of the delay, I actually went ahead and had Fry's run a diagnostic check on my computer.  Turns out the motherboard is the problem, not the power supply.  So even if they had turned up, they would have cocked up the repair anyway.  I would give these cowboys minus 5 stars if Amazon would let me.","[]","B001N89O82","B001N89O82","AHZ4XSDB7WSGCUTQ45UPXHUG5I7A","2017-02-27 22:48:04.000","4","True","512"
"810517","5","Wonderful headset, very well made with many useful features.","What a wonderful device! Well made, pretty and has so many features too. I bought the paired set SMH10-11 that had 2 different microphones because I wasn't sure which was best for my modular helmet. I ended up using the boom microphone on my Nolan N43 Trilogy helmet. The Sena headset comes with a wide selection of mounting accessories too. I installed the speakers easily but decided to install the extra speaker pads too so they were closer to my ears.  I'm using this primarily for communicating with other riders in my group. The units work wonderful for talking to each other and have a very long range. We paired the head sets to our cell phones and when we got out of Intercom Range, I voice dialed my friend and we could talk while we got close enough to use the intercom again. In my area, basically, if we can SEE each other, the intercom works and works well. When the Intercom Mode is enabled and on, you just talk back and forth like on a phone call, you can hear the other person talking while you talk, you don't have to wait for the other to stop talking first like a radio or walkie-talkie. I guess that's what Full-Duplex means. I'm not sure if all other headsets work like that but this one does. My Star Raider with straight Cobra Swept pipes and windshield is louder than his full dressed Spyder and while I did not hear any wind noise at all, my friend said he heard 'some wind noise' while I wasn't talking, but when I talked the noise went away. The headset paired perfectly with my iPhone 5C; the phone, SIRI and GPS all worked fine, which was a pleasant surprise. I hadn't tried listening to music yet so don't know how well the speakers perform in that manner, but all regular talking and communications were loud and clear. I'm able to ask Siri to text someone too, very cool. While in Intercom Mode and talking I received a phone call, took the call and when ended it went right back to Intercom. All very easy and not distracting at all while riding. We rode for about 4 hours and the battery was still &#34;full&#34; when I got home, I expect the stated 10-12 hours ride time will be correct. Initially we are very pleased with this Sena model and I'll update the review later after more experience, especially after pairing with more riders in the group.","[]","B0087NB0ZQ","B09ZJWLQ7X","AG2TKWXCLEGLRRZET4J775HAIS6A","2017-09-03 17:16:49.538","8","True","512"
"24804","5","This JBL Flip 3 is one of the best purchases I have ever made!","I am so happy with this bluetooth speaker! This JBL Flip 3 is one of the best purchases I have ever made! I grew up with old time amplifiers, turntables, and huge living room speakers, and have not heard anything I respect or like since then . . until now. THIS is the best music sound I have heard in many years (!!!Much!!! better than the Bose Sound Dock I bought a few years back).\\n\\nThis JBL speaker arrived last night. I got it connected to my Galaxy S7 via bluetooth and put it through it's paces with a variety of music - everything from Streisand to Zepplin. This thing is incredible! The fact that it is so small astounds me. The music sound quality is excellent. I mean it. It produces very smooth, very balanced, very rich response across the spectrum. No harshness, no boominess, no shrillness, no muffled tones. The sound is full and unbelievably rich. Nothing but really clean, balanced tones. My friend and I sat there with our jaws dropped open. Even subtle bass is incredibly warm, smooth, and rich - not boomy. Highs are very present, crisp, and clean - never shrill. Mids are beautifully balanced and clear.\\n\\nAnd, on top of it, no wires!!! I LOVE that I can just pick it up and move it wherever I want and it just keeps playing - and no wires all getting in the way. Oh, and my Android Galaxy S7 stayed paired with this speaker just from up to around maybe thirty feet away.\\n\\nAnd, it sits just fine on a flat surface and stays in place. There is no rolling or anything. When you set it down, you seem to intuitively feel that there is a &#34;sweet spot&#34; where it just likes to sit flat and stay put.\\n\\nThe size is smaller than I expected, too. It's maybe six o to seven inches long, and maybe three inches in diameter. And, it's got a little weight to it. It feels substantial and very well made. And, it blends into the background well without screaming attention to itself.\\n\\nThe one things that isn't good is the documentation that comes with it (or lack of docucmentation). I was sitting on my patio with a flashlight and magnifying glass trying to read it.","[]","B0145EOFDO","B0145EOFDO","AHJZB7POAKILL66BMMLODHZRVUPA","2017-04-14 19:04:40.000","0","True","512"
"856551","4","Mostly a good little router for a mobile application. Some small issues, but no deal breakers.","I purchased the Peplink Pepwave Surf On-The-Go Wi-Fi Router (SUS-AGN1) to use in a camper conversion. I want to use a Verizon PanTech 4G cellular modem and, when available, wifi hotspots. This little router does both without being overly complex.\\nThis router (purchased 10/1/2017) came with the most recent firmware installed, but no user manual or even a quick setup sheet. There is a spec sheet and manual (.pdf) available on the support area of the peplink websie, but is doesn't reflect the most recent firmware. Not too bad since most of the functions are covered in the manual or fairly easy to understand; but it would be nice to have up-to-date documentation. Some things changed from a manual selection to &#34;AUTO&#34; and it would be helpful to understand the &#34;AUTO&#34; criteria.\\nIt comes with a 120VAC-12VDC power supply, which is OK, but since it's named &#34;On-The-Go&#34; wouldn't a 12V plug/regulator be a good idea also? It's not like the thing was really inexpensive.\\nSetup was easy once I got the manual, but the router takes a LONG time to boot up and find connections, and several minutes to change modes from cell to hotspots. Not a deal breaker, but inconvenient.\\nThe 5dbi antenna does a good job of pulling in wifi signals from hotspots and campground networks, better than my laptop alone, and the rebroadcast coverage in the camper is excellent. It needs to be reconfigured for each new SSID, but different profiles can be saved so regular spots can be easily selected. Setup can be done with a laptop, but I use my tablet most of the time. Anything with a browser should work; just bookmark the admin page for easy access.\\nWhen I'm using the 4G modem there is nothing to do but turn it on. With wifi, in addition to getting better range; being able to set all the devices to the router SSID/encryption, and then just reconfigure the router to the local hotspot info is nice.\\nSo... great performance, out-of-date documentation, and long boot/change times add up to four stars. I like it, but there are issues.","[]","B007BD6GDE","B007BD6GDE","AEGQ2AYHUEMCFN7ARBRF3LC5UX3Q","2017-10-03 02:46:11.870","3","True","512"
"939393","5","This mouse is great! TL;DR - Buy this mouse if you have the money.","This mouse is absolutely great.\\n\\nAs a person with slightly above average hand size, it is surprisingly difficult for me to find a good feeling mouse, as I use a claw grip when gaming most of the time. It fits my hand like a glove. I hardly ever have to adjust my hand when I reach for it. The ergonomics are spectacular.\\n\\nThe RGB LEDs are pretty color correct, although some lighter colors aren't quite as accurate. For most of my setups with my other RGBs, it does absolutely fine.\\n\\nThe Logitech Gaming software is phenomenal. It works exactly as you would expect, and is very responsive. It's what the Cue software with Corsair should have been.\\n\\nThe weight tuning is great. The mouse is fairly light without the weights, but once they are added it is a good weight. I would like if the weight was heavier fully loaded, but it's absolutely fine for me.\\n\\nAll of the buttons on the mouse are easily acceptable and are all programmable. The configuration is fine with me from stock, but it is easily changed for your individual needs. You can even add macros to each button as well!\\n\\nThe DPI sensitivity is insane. 200 dpi to 12000 dpi. You can set 5 individual levels of DPI according to your needs, all easily adjustable on the buttons of your choosing (from stock they are the buttons directly to the left of the primary mouse button). You can also include a DPI shift, which is accessed by holding the button where your thumb rests. It can be used to lower (although some use it to heighten) the DPI for more accurate (or faster, respectively) mouse movement depending on your needs.\\n\\nThe scroll wheel is also great. I was unaware of the usefulness of the feature until I received the product. It makes scrolling through long web pages or applications a breeze. Instead of restricting the mouse by making it &#34;click&#34; every so often, you can release the mouse wheel and allow it to spin freely. You can also use it normally, if you wish.\\n\\nThe mouse itself is very grippy, but not too rubberized as to promote sweaty hands or be uncomfortable.\\n\\nAll in all, if you have the money, buy this mouse. It is great for both gaming and productivity.","[]","B019OB663A","B019OB663A","AHZBIFMKWWZHILYEIYOSP4AIA37Q","2017-01-04 05:20:36.000","0","True","512"
"58540","3","Sonnet TB-USB3GE Thunderbolt to USB3 + Gigabit Ethernet adapter","I bought this adapter in an attempt to add a USB 3.0 port to my mid-2012 iMac (called &#34;model 12,2&#34; in About This Mac...), which has two Thunderbolt (1.0?) ports and only USB 2.0 ports.  Unfortunately, I quickly discovered that it requires OS 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion) or above, while I still run Snow Leopard (10.6.8).  I'm not crazy about any of the newer Mac OSes starting with 10.7.  The adapter is recognized by the Mac + Snow Leopard, as indicated by going into About This Mac and clicking on Thunderbolt.  However, that doesn't mean you'll get functionality out of it.  It just sits there like a bump on a log, refusing to acknowledge anything you plug into the USB 3.0 port. On a Mac, says Sonnet, there are no drivers to install; the assumption is that the OS already has them built in, but there are probably no such drivers included in Snow Leopard, which is 6-7 years old as I write this.\\n\\nIf you go to Sonnet's web page to find its specs (and yes, I regret not doing so before I bought it), you will see in red letters &#34;Product no longer available.&#34;  Nowhere but Amazon, apparently. Don't expect to see it listed much longer.\\n\\nThe good news is that it did not fry my new external SSD when I connected to it. Oh, and since you often see such questions raised, the flexible part of the cable is a mere 3.0&#34; long.\\n\\nI wish I could tell you that it works, or even that it doesn't work, but I don't know one way or the other.  Sonnet makes good stuff, so I expect it does work if you have the right operating system to support it.  How many stars to give it?  I chose three, only because of the incomplete Amazon listing.  Amazon should state in its product spec the two limitations I describe above, which would have warned me not to buy it for my particular iMac.  Strangely, I'll probably keep it in case I one day decide to bite the bullet and install a partition running Sierra or above. If/when I do that, I'll update this review and change the star rating accordingly.","[]","B00T9LI7CO","B00T9LI7CO","AFORISN6BJ6ODEFQPRM4TFY5JZIA","2017-01-08 06:59:27.000","1","True","512"
"664729","4","Great multi-use tool - solid construction","This little gadget turned out to be way more useful than I had anticipated. I originally purchased this thinking I'd use it for photography for some creative shots, or possible long exposures with the Lightroom camera, but it's turned out to be a great stand, bottle opener, and just cool little gadget to fidget with.\\n\\nFor the price, I didn't think the quality of the metal would be this good.The edges aren't rough, it doesn't scuff or scratch too much, and it surprisingly did an amazing job balancing my pretty sizy Nexus 6P. I read about complaints about the plastic giving out, and while there is a little bit of play once it's in the connector port (I have the USB-C version), the actually ball joint is very stiff and stable.  My friend has the Apple version, and surprisingly that one fit like a glove. There was practically no movement in the connection. It's still great in the USB-C version, but it did feel much better in Apple's lighting connector version. So in conclusion, the metal is great, but the plastic in the USB-C version is a little finicky, and I suspect with time, it may become loose. But mine is still going strong after 1 year!\\n\\nErgonomically this gadget works wonders. I often use it as a stand for my phone at work, and sometimes when I'm sitting and trying to watch a video, I'll place it in the horizontal tilt mode so I don't have to the phone in my hand. I absolutely love this setup because the 6P has forward facing speakers, and tripod provides the perfect tilt angle all without having to hold it at all. Furthermore, there is a small key chain mounting whole in the base so you can attach this to your key chain.\\n\\nLastly, if you're one of those people that constantly needs to do something with their hands, this is a nice key chain addition that will keep you occupied in addition to being useful.\\n\\nI did read some comments about this not being compatible with cases, and I agree, the clearance is very small. I've never used a case so it doesn't matter to me, but I know many people do so that might be a legitimate concern. I can't confirm the problem because I don't have any cases, but be aware of this. You might have to take your case off if you want to use the tripod.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gGa5tTFlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gGa5tTFlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gGa5tTFlL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kYMhii-fL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kYMhii-fL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kYMhii-fL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mOPjcLq9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mOPjcLq9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mOPjcLq9L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tkTCPm1RL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tkTCPm1RL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tkTCPm1RL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01ECPWC5E","B08H7XZHDX","AFJ6B6V5T335IMHM6KCMFHUC5IGQ","2017-10-15 22:46:07.846","2","True","512"

You should get these instead!","Great noise canceling earbuds for the price!\\n\\nUsage:  I purchased these as I am frequently traveling by air, and I wanted to hear my movies and audio better in flight.  These things work great for earbud style headphones and they drastically reduce the ambient noise on airplanes, though there is still a bit of background hum from the engines and you will still hear loud talkers. I never fly without this headset!\\n\\nPros:\\n- Active Noise Cancellation vs, Passive\\n- They are good at noise reduction without having gigantic over the ear versions.\\n- Powered by a single AAA battery that's easily replaceable when needed\\n- Long usage time on single battery.\\n- Comfortable fit inside the ear with multiple sized rubber tips to fit every ear canal\\n- Volume control built in to the headset with a wheel so you don't need to mess with your device to turn it up or down.\\n- Functional on/of slider switch to enable and disable noise canceling (You can still use them in the off position just with no noise cancellation)\\n- If you purchase with the Blucoil extender (6'ft extension cable), it comes with a compact carry case with room for headset and spare batteries, just don't expect to fit the extension cable and the headset together.\\n\\nCons:\\n-The inline battery, on/off switch and volume control are just long enough to clip to a belt or clothing, but can sometimes be a nuisance if you re-adjust your seated position or can get in the way if you are moving things around in your close proximity.\\n-It's more of a Noise reduction than a noise canceling performance but I believe that's the nature of variable sound. Though the functionality is obviously working, the headset appears to struggle with certain ambient sounds or db levels. I had hoped that since the earbuds are essentially obstructing your ear canal with the fit, the results would be better as well.\\n\\nSummary:\\nI love this headset and it is a staple in my luggage when traveling but often times its a bit constrictive to body movement. I think it could also be a little better at Cancellation but you can't beat the price for the quality. That being said, I have no intention on finding an alternate headset as these perform very nicely!","[]","B01ES27O86","B01ES27O86","AFN3LRUUTHI4WRWYYAVWVUGEJ42A","2017-04-12 14:47:08.000","6","True","512"
"551235","1","Years back, I wanted a Bluetooth tape adapter..","[update 6-Nov] A week later, it stopped raining and I took the car out for a Sunday drive. Three bad things happened that are making me think about just listening to the radio.\\n\\nFirst - more pairing/unpairing issues. Randomly unpairing in the middle of a song. A few minutes later I switched to radio and then back to the tape - a good 20 seconds or so until the tape adapter spun up and re-paired.\\n\\nSecond - if I would do anything to the phone (unlock, attempt to change volume on the phone), playback skipped. This is odd, as it has never happened while paired to factory Bluetooth on my other car (fwiw, 2015 Toyota).\\n\\nThird - audio quality, even though I did not actually touch the tape adapter, was far worse than the week before. Super tinny. Switching Dolby settings on the car's tape player, playing with the DSP/equalizer on the car, and equalizer on the phone - nothing really helped.\\n\\n[Original review]\\nI recently bought a 15-year-old car with a CD changer and a tape player. It's 15 years old and I don't want to spend hundreds on retrofitting Bluetooth the proper way. I remember years back when Bluetooth was first becoming a thing how wonderful it would be if a Bluetooth tape adapter existed... now it does.\\n\\nAs other reviewers mentioned, you're well-served by taking the clear plastic film off of the play head. The sound isn't anything special - but it's better than I recall from other tape adapters and regular tapes. I had to set the volume on my phone to about 7/8 to get the best sound.\\n\\nA couple things are a little irritating. First - the packaging is that horrible clamshell plastic. Second - over the course of a couple days, I had pairing issues with my phone. Random unpairings, not pairing gracefully when starting the car, etc.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, it gets the job done, but it is still a bit of a hacky solution for older cars. The factory unit on my other car (model year 2015) is a relative dream - but the ION adapter allows my model year 2002 car to work for mid-length road trips where I might not have great radio reception.","[]","B00I3YLHAC","B00I3YLHAC","AGAIPFVQVSIIC577IR5XL54B5ECQ","2017-10-31 18:08:59.172","0","True","512"
"374305","1","Good sound and good bass","October 20 2017 UPDATE. I now have 2 SoundTouch 30's, 8 SoundTouch 20's, 1 SoundTouch 10 pair and a SoundTouch 130 Home Theater System. I purchased the first of them on July 28 2016. The 30 and the 20 are good quality MONO speakers (it's absurd you still can't turn the 20's and 30's into stereo pairs). I would give the 30 and 20 both 5 stars and the 10 2 stars as a stand alone speaker. This update is regarding the SoundTouch software. After using it for over a year and updating it with each new update I am beyond frustrated. The current version is 16.0.9 and it's the worst yet. With each new update they add some nice features but fail to make the speakers sync reliably. Most often I play together 1 30, 2 20's and my 10 stereo pair. Sometimes it will work well for 1-3 hours and then it's chaos - with speakers dropping out and the music speeding up and slowing down. The 10 is the biggest problem - sometimes I can turn off the 10 pair and it will work but other times it still won't work. Sometimes turning them all off and disconnecting/reconnecting bluetooth will solve the issue but other times it will not. This has always been a problem with the software but it's probably worse it's ever been with version 16.0.9. I have called Bose support many times. I called today and they told me their engineers are aware of the problem and are working on it. They have always been aware and working on it. If you're only playing one of the speakers it works pretty reliably.\\n\\nGood sound and good bass. I use it with Amazon Echo Dot. In my house I have 2 SoundTouch 30's, 3 SoundTouch 20's and 1 SoundTouch 10. They all sync well with occasional one-second dropouts. I use the SoundTouch 20's in my guest room bathroom (pictured) and in my master bathroom and in my smallest bedroom and it's great in those small rooms. For larger rooms I think it's well worth it to go up to the SoundTouch 30.

Better than a Netgear AC1600 wifi router.","Features (In theory):\\n-AC1900 Wi-Fi speed (Dual band 600 Mbps in 2.4GHz + 1300 Mpbs in 5GHz) to support more connected Wi-Fi devices to your high speed home network\\n-Enjoy 4K/HD video and online gaming simultaneously with 3 x3 data streams and 4 high-performance antenna\\n-The dual core processor gives you powerful wired and wireless network speeds\\n-Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) Technology for simultaneous streaming on multiple devices\\n-Advanced SmartBeam tracks your connected devices for enhanced Wi-Fi speed and range throughout your home\\n\\nPerformance (In practice):\\n-The dual band in (N + AC) helps with speed, but I found that changing the wifi setting (advanced settings) to separate N and AC gives the fastest *benchmark values. Default setting combined the N and AC, giving only one SSID. I'm not familiar with the software/algorithm that determines the optimal connection for your device. When I split the signal (giving two SSID) I get faster benchmark U/D values.  For example, under default setting, I can get 24 Mbps download and 9 Mbps upload. When I split the signals and connect to the AC signal, I can get 70+ Mbps download and 18 Mbps upload. When connected to N signal, I get 18 Mbps download and 8 Mbps upload.  My hardwired desktop gets 190+ Mbps download and 28 Mbps upload (Comcast/Xfinity modem).\\n-This wifi router can stream HD videos to three devices with no hiccups. However, streaming 4K content will pretty much hog the throughput. Streaming 4K to the TV (wifi) will significantly affect HD streaming to an iPad (for example).  Streaming 4K to the TV (hardwired) does not affect HD streaming to an iPad.  So it is a wifi problem.\\n-Have not determined if dual-core processor makes a difference, but this wifi router is faster than my older wireless N router (Netgear AC1600).\\n-MU-MIMO seems to work better than Netgear AC1600. This DIR-878 can support 3 iPads streaming HD movies simultaneously.\\n-Advanced Smartbeam seems to work, but I don't know how to test it.\\n\\nOverall, a very good AC wifi router.","[]","B06XGB3X7R","B06XGB3X7R","AFBJA5KNLS5JOENH23ZCVJPGJCXA","2017-08-22 20:08:50.081","0","False","512"
"895427","5","Love this thing!","This is a versatile tablet that works very well for personal and business use. The halo keys work very well and I've taken several hours of meeting notes this way and it is so small, sleek and compact that it isn't obtrusive at all and with the halo keys, it is silent unlike a laptop would be. The keyboard is a bit small but I am getting used to it. The halo keyboard is also nice to have as when it is flipped in tablet mode, no keys are sticking out and the keyboard &#34;shuts off&#34; so you don't have to worry about accidental key presses.\\n\\nIt is extremely fast and responsive and the screen is superb. I love watching HD videos on it as the screen is nice and clear and sound is really good for its size though I usually use headphones. An added bonus is it can be use as a traditional tablet, opened like a laptop, or in tent mode. I've used all 3 depending on what I am doing so its a nice option to have. The battery life is very good for a tablet of this size and I have no problem getting through the day with it at work. The screen and size of the tablet seems to work quite well. The only benefit of wishing it was a bit bigger would be to have a larger halo keyboard, but not a huge issue for me.\\n\\nI haven't used the pad for my notes much as I prefer to type my notes, but when I did try it out, it did work out quite well. I'm just more of a typist, so just not something I would use much, but is a nice feature that works well if that is your preference. I also used the stylus in tablet mode and that worked very well. Response was good as was using my finger. They did a nice job with this touch screen.\\n\\nIf you need more space you can add a micro SD card to increase the capacity beyond the 64GB. Not an issue for me yet as it is new, but nice to have the option or if you want to store a lot of pictures, music, etc... I do plan to take this on vacation with me instead of my big clunky laptop so might pop a card in before then to store some videos to watch or to store pictures.\\n\\nOverall this is a fantastic device that I would recommend for personal use, business use, or a mix of both.","[]","B01N1OUWBX","B01N1OUWBX","AEBWQVEHJ4QDSL2MMM7J7QVZPGFA","2017-03-02 13:15:48.000","2","False","512"
"461437","4","Updated AVC decoding nicely upscales 1080p content.  This unit delivers affordable AVC and HEVC decoding with great quality!","First, I was very happy but later, very sad.  The H.265 HEVC decoding is very efficient.  HDR algorithms work very well, no artifacts, menus are ugly but work.  Small but practical remote control, I was a happy.\\n\\nThen I decided to compare the H.264 decoding using another H.264 decoder that I am quite familiar with:  Playstation 3.  The first thing you will notice is less detail, which makes us think about the quality of the H.264 decoder in this player.  Less detail translates into a less efficient decoder or a decoder that was intentionally set at a lower bitrate, when compared to the Playstation 3 decoder.  Now, there are some color aberrations and there is no control to reduce the apparent high temperature of the color palette.  When looking closer at the TV screen (I have a good one, a XBR-65X950B), one can conclude that this decoder does not feature a well implemented deblocking filter.  I am sad and disappointed.  And, if am a little technical here, is because I tried my best to make a fair set of assumptions before publishing a negative review for an otherwise nice player.  But the H.264 decoder needs to be improved or serious videophiles like me will not go for this product.\\n\\nIn a nutshell:  4K Ultra High Definition is very well implemented.  Conventional Blu-Ray playing is mediocre and does not upscale but actually downscales normal Blu-Ray content.  If you intend to play ONLY 4K content, go for it. If you intend to play BOTH 4K AND 1080p Blu-Ray content, wait a bit more for future upgrades or new players or plan to pay $500 with a more expensive player.\\n\\n****UPDATE IN JULY 30***\\n\\nApparently Sony has updated the AVC decoding algorithm with the newest firmware upgrade and now the deblocking filter has been implemented and other improvements are evident on the AVC (Advanced Video Coding) decoder which is the one that upscales Blu-Ray content to 4K.  Highly recommended!\\n\\nPerhaps if the storage would not be necessary via an external USB drive it would be cleaner for the purpose of having BD-Live content viewing and storage.  In any case, this units seems to be solid and now performs as expected.","[]","B01N4RCPKO","B07S247YBJ","AG3BWPB4WANPA3YSGFVV5JQCZKXQ","2017-07-08 07:07:44.158","23","True","512"

I chose this model for a balance between price and dual band network capability.\\n\\nSetup was a snap and took a total of 5 minutes! It connects directly to the wall because I don’t have a modem with fiber.\\nWent to the website and followed the installation wizard. I have not looked for open source firmware, so I’m only commenting on the router with TP-link installed firmware.\\n\\nA couple of things to noteas far as performance: my old spectrum/ G router combo only gave me wireless speeds of 12 mbps, so I’m not hard to please when it comes to super fast connections.\\n\\nI have 7 devices in my household- laptop, tablet, Roku, 2 phones, a Wii and Xbox.\\nThe fiber connection is *advertised* to support up to 250 mbps.\\n\\nI did not test my wired speed because I don’t use my devices that way.\\n\\nI ran the speed test on my IPhone on the 5G network (which also has the Xbox and tablet connected)  and am showing around 36 mbps. Good enough for me. The picture shows: TOP TP-link router/ fiber internet MIDDLE Netgear G router/fiber and BOTTOM Netgear G router/Spectrum Internet. You can really see how much better this is over a G router.\\n\\nOn the 2.4 network, my laptop(which has a b, g, n adapter and won’t connect to ac) speed test clocked around 26. The Roku is also connected to this network, and streams fine (but it also streamed fine on the old one too)\\n\\nThe signal on both bands is very strong upstairs, downstairs and on my back porch.\\n\\nOverall, this is a great router if you want a low cost option to get in on the 5G WiFi network.\\n\\n It’s not lightening fast, but it’s better than the old G Router and 5 G speed is better than decent for my needs.\\nIt does not perform like higher class and higher priced routers but then again, it’s way, way better than what I expected for $40.","[]","B0168G0KZY","B0168G0KZY","AFPIUJEJ7SKDQDAQYA2WK4CPWARQ","2017-12-05 05:19:27.047","2","True","512"
"446166","2","Nope. Not a peer of Bose. Not even close.","I've tested a great many bluetooth speakers and only a few bubble up as clear winners: in the mid-size portable range, Klipsch KMC3 and Bang & Olufsen Beolit 15 / 17 are the distinct winners for big sound from a small machine. In the ultra-portable range, Bose SoundLink Mini has simply dominated every other compact offering, bar none, for four years. I gave up looking for anything better-sounding in that ultraportable range two years ago - until Bose figured out how to outdo itself. They recently released the Revolve / Revolve+. I bought a Revolve+ the instant I learned about it and found it to be good - but different than the Mini, and not clearly BETTER.\\n\\nI also recently went back to the well and thought, maybe there's an ultraportable out there that can pack more good sound (ESPECIALLY bass) into a comparably tiny package. I tried the KEF Gravity One... and spit it back out. Fine treble, weird soundstage, twice the price, and absolutely no bass of any kind under 120Hz. Puzzling, but unacceptable. Spit it back out.\\n\\nI've been eyeballing the B&W T7 as well for some time now and figured, OK, I'll give it a spin. Just bought it and... whiff.\\n\\nIt doesn't have weak bass, it has no bass. Great crisp treble, good warm vocals, but no bass at all. It's about on par with the KEF Gravity One for having great treble, good mids, and abysmal, entirely absent bass. It looks great, it's well built, it feels and looks like quality, but the sound simply fails. It's so dramatically inferior to the SoundLink Mini and even the Revolve+ that the rest of the features (call handling, battery, etc.) are irrelevant. This is going back. On the basis of sound quality alone, this is &#34;and the rest&#34;. At some point, some engineers and product managers at another company is going to need to force themselves to listen to the tiny Bose speakers - ideally side by side with their own - before they say, yep, good enough, ship it. Such as it is, I can tell that no such exercise occurred before shipping this speaker, or any other tiny one for that matter.","[]","B00OLE9606","B00OLE9606","AGWPYUXR43CM7C5CYUE4SUEC62QA","2017-09-26 21:13:09.646","4","False","512"
"43363","3","It's fine, not great. Let's not reward Intel for making absolutely no progress at all.","Now, my 3 stars isn't because this product is in any way bad. As Amazon suggests, &#34;it's OK&#34;. This doesn't set the world on fire. It runs things smoothly, period. Some hitches here and there when the CPU seems to be thinking twice about what it's about to do, otherwise fine. Fine, is not OMG AMAZING 5 STARS. It's just that, fine. The 3 stars are because this product, is a joke. IT's the exact same performance as the previous generation, and nobody should give Intel a pass on this behavior. Now that AMD is competing with Ryzen, 8th gen is adding cores. Look at that, suddenly Intel is doing something, anything. That, however, did not happen with Kaby lake, literally 0% performance gains, and for that, you get 3 stars - a mere fine.\\n\\nNot only that - I sold my GPU and spent about 2 weeks with integrated CPU graphics (Intel HD 630) until I bought a GTX1060. I use a 4K screen, which was well supported at 4K30. However, lowering the resolution to 1440p, it was IMPOSSIBLE to get it working at 60fps. Mind you, this CPU is sold and advertised as supporting HDMI1.4 spec, which covers up to 1440p60. No way to get it working. These 2 weeks were spent chatting with Intel support to figure this out, and while they at least made efforts to solve it, nothing (everything else in this build has been used with previous GPUs/monitors up to 4K60, so the rest of the hardware was fine, this was clearly the HD 630's fault). This is a big, big problem, whether it's due to driver support or otherwise, I do not know, but it's certainly unacceptable and nothing that will earn this product an amazing review. It's fine. It did its job, kind of, except when it failed to deliver.\\n\\nI bought this CPU because I had already purchased DDR4 for my new build this past spring, and Ryzen's growing pains with memory support prevented me from using the memory on their motherboards. I didn't want to wait until support came along, so I made an Intel build. In a couple years, we'll see who gets my money: either Intel gets back into the game and innovates some, or I'll make sure I buy AMD the next round.","[]","B01MZZJ1P0","B01N7SX2LD","AEFRD3YPTVAGZTGQITOCRGSVYHWQ","2017-08-31 15:08:40.110","13","True","512"
"797045","1","Really?","Totally puzzled by all the good reviews here. The ONLY reason I purchased this was because of the good reviews, but it really is a mystery. Just another typical electronic piece of Chinese junk. This thing has an exceptionally bad user interface which is totally not intuitive. You would think the middle button acts like an &#34;enter&#34; button, but it does not. The &#34;menu&#34; button serves as &#34;enter&#34;. Then all you options are listed vertically but the button to navigate is a right and left button. The volume? It is always set at 24 out of 40. No problem, I set mine to 35. But wait! The player turns off and when you turn it on again, the volume is back at 24. So every single time I use the player I have to play with the volume. Come on folks, this is 2017 here. This is the best you could do? To top it off, the interface is maddeningly non-intuitive to the point where I was cussing at this device when all I wanted to do was find a song in one of my many folders. And it has the ability to show pictures on the color screen, so why can't it display album art? Good question.\\n\\nLastly, and not to be too picky, but this player cannot handle some foreign language letters that it should, specifically Middle Eastern languages. It only displays question marks in these cases. I would not really fault this device except that my 15 year old Napster MP3 player I got for free displays these foreign language characters just fine. In this day and age, adding capability to display the top 100 worldwide languages is fairly trivial.\\n\\nBottom line: I can only guess why this is rated so highly here but I hate to speculate. Suffice it to say that the identical device found here: https://smile.amazon.com/Lecmal-Player-Economic-Multifunctional-Portable/dp/B07218PPMS/ref=sr_1_10?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1501302940&sr=1-10&keywords=mp3+player is rated 3 stars. So you draw your own conclusions...The MOST important function of an MP3 player like this is a fast responding and easy to navigate GUI and this device fails miserably at these tasks.","[]","B073Z9VLB6","B073Z9VLB6","AG5F3F5W5QMOYQVBOEHHUDJ7D6OA","2017-07-29 04:48:06.129","3","True","512"

Needless to say, active noise cancelling headphones sound like a great idea.  This is a great invention.  I don't know what other brands are like, but this one does a great job filtering out background noise.  I wear them frequently now in spite of the cosmetic flaw from faulty construction (see photos).\\n\\nI reluctantly got these as a really expensive 2016 Christmas present for myself -- I still can't believe I spent the money on them.  I was so motivated by my condition, however I decided to bite the bullet and spend the money.  I can honestly say that there isn't much that bothers me when I put on a little light music and tune out everything happening around me.\\n\\nI am reducing the review by 1 star because of price.  This might be me, but even $100 is too much for headphones... let alone more than double that.  The price is rough, although I understand it's an industry standard for these.\\n\\nI am reducing the review by a 2nd star because of a cosmetic defect that appeared within about a week of opening the box.  I don't believe they were damaged in the box, but with EXTREMELY light use over a short period of time (before that first charge was up, no less than 3 or 4 uses) the thin metal screen on the exterior of the earpiece frayed.  I noticed because it was poking my fingers when I would press the button on the earpiece.  The device still works, but the fray can catch on things like my skin or clothes.  I'm not sure this is something covered under warranty, but for what I spent on these headphones, they shouldn't be falling apart already -- or ever -- for that matter.

I am using the switch box to switch between a modern surround sound receiver and a vintage 70's intigrated amp that will be used strictly for turntable playback. I am sharing the front speakers between the receiver and amp, since my front channel speakers ate also vintage 70's floorstanding speakers.\\n\\nWhen i finished plugging everything in, I switched on the surround sound receiver and heard only the subs - no front left and right channel speakers. Playing with the speaker switches on this brand new switchbox, I could intermittently get the speakers to work momentarily if I kept pushing the appropriate speaker switch.\\n\\nFirst of all I was furious after spending all this time preparing wires and moving furniture. Secondly, I thought to myself, these speaker switches on this box are acting like they have 50 years of oxidation on their contacts.

This cable replaced a DVI cable with fully functional HDMI capability.  My video is now crystal clear and the colors vibrant and true with no artifacts.  Although the cable, as pictured, looks as though it might be stiff, it is amazingly supple and compliant.  I'm so impressed with this excellent product that I am ordering another one so that I can have both my desktop and laptop computers attached to my 1080P Panasonic plasma TV.  And when I can afford a 4K OLED TV, they will work with that too.  Did I mention that the audio now comes over the HDMI?\\n\\nBTW, and although this has nothing to do with this cable, be sure to turn off your TV's OVERSCAN feature.  Do this on ALL inputs and, if it is a 'smart' TV, do it to the phantom input that is assigned to it's W/LAN, as well.  You will be astounded in the improved picture you will get!  Not only can you see the full computer monitor screen on your TV but, you will get much more detailed pictures and video as well.  Search the WWWeb under &#34;how to turn off overscan on my TV&#34; or some such wording, and you will shortly become an expert.  Overscan is a default feature found on virtually all digital TV's, and is a left over, built-in &#34;fix&#34; for analog, CRT TV's.  It CAN be turned off, usually by simply renaming your inputs to DVI/PC, but the actual procedure may vary by manufacturer.  Look it up.\\n\\nOkay, so why defeat overscan?  Well simply, because it throws away as much as 20% of your pixels and enlarges the remainder to fill your screen.  This means that your nice sharp, big screen TV is showing you a DIGITALLY ZOOMED image.  Not good.  And, if you are using your TV as a PC monitor, all your border detail is missing or only partially there,as well; your tool bars, your edge icons, etc.  Oh yes, and that nice wallpaper that looks so good on your laptop is blurry, washed out, and missing all the good stuff that went into making an appealing, photgraphic composition.\\n\\n'Nuff said.

Here is what I've out about it since then:\\n\\nPros:\\nScreen - the screen is a good size and bright - I rarely set the brightness above 75%.\\n2-in-1 - I don't use it as a tablet nearly as often as I thought I would, but it is nice to have when I need it.\\nKeyboard - good size, responsive keys - backlighting is very helpful\\nTouchpad - very responsive - great if you typically only use one hand\\n\\nCons:\\nBuild quality - it is quite flimsy. If you pick it up with one hand while it is open you will hear all kinds of pops and creaks. Also, if you typically rest your hands to the sides of the touchpad while you type, it will occasionally register the heal of your hand pressing down as a &#34;click&#34; - even when not touching the touchpad.\\nTouchpad - If you normally use two hands to use your touchpad - finger of one hand resting on the left button while the finger(s) of the other hand move the cursor - you'll have problems. The touchpad buttons on this one are also capacitive and you end up zooming in and out repeatedly. So either get use to using one hand or use a mouse.\\nTouchscreen - most of the time it works fine, but every couple days it'll just stop working and you'll need to reboot to get it back. Typically it happens when you move it to/from tablet mode.\\n\\nOverall - for the price this has been a good laptop. It, like most things, has it good points and its bad. I've learned to work around the bad, but would prefer not to. Would I buy it again? Probably not. There are others out there for the same price point that work better. For my job I am assigned HP laptops and of the 3 I've had over the past 6 years, none have had the number of issues this one has had. But then those havent' been 2-in-1 laptops with touchscreens. I didn't mention battery life as either a pro nor a con - it is okay.

I have 3 computers (desktop win 7, laptop win 7, laptop win 10) and all 3 had different problems accessing this drive. I spent at least 4 hours on tech support with different issues.\\n\\n2. Slower than any technology in this century. Whether you're transferring data, or simply browsing data on the drive, this thing is slow. I can walk into my kitchen and get a cup of coffee before it shows the contents of the folder.\\n\\n3. Thumbnails of images don't appear until days later. Not sure if it's building a preview library or what, but it's annoying.\\n\\n4. No rescue capability. If you delete a file, it's gone baby. No software you have will rescue it. MAYBE if you spend thousands of dollars and send it to some company, maybe they'll be able to do it. And that's the words from Segate tech support.\\n\\n5. Transfer speeds crawl after awhile. When transferring data to the drive, it starts out at one speed, but then after awhile, it goes down quite a bit. It's ridiculous that you can't just connect it to a computer to start with to transfer data or move data around on the drive and organize it.\\n\\n6. Does not do incremental backups. This is so terrible it's unbelievable that they released this on the market. If you have 1 TB of data, and you modify some data files, it will not do an incremental backup to your external USB drive (which they recommend). You'll have to do a full backup every time. 1 TB took me many days to transfer to the USB drive.\\n\\nI can't tell you how much I dislike this drive. I can't return it or sell it since it has my data on it and I can't do any sort of secure wipe of the drive. I'm stuck with this thing.\\n\\nMaybe a better option is to buy a external drive and stick on to my router, or even a dedicated computer that's on all the time (so i can do nightly backups, access files 24/7, etc.)\\n\\nEDIT: April 2017.

"113933","3","and functional wall mount that is easy to install","4 stars for build quality and ease of use.  3 stars for my application.\\nThis is a very simple, affordable, and functional wall mount that is easy to install. The included 4K HDMI cable is a nice bonus. It seems well made and works fine; however, the braided jacket makes it a very stiff cable and it doesn’t route easily. In my opinion, a cable used in a wall mount application should be very flexible and easy to route. The included level is fine; however, I recommend using at least a 2ft level since the included 6” level offers very little confidence for installation. If you plan on mounting this bracket with the outlet(s) situated between the upper and lower rails like I did, be aware that the opening is the EXACT height of a typical outlet cover. If you have more than one outlet, make sure they are at the exact same height or you will need to trim the covers to attach the mount to the wall. And low profile surge suppressors may or may not interfere with the bracket. The spacing between railings is the biggest negative I have against this mount. The top & bottom bracket rails are in two pieces for TV’s over 32”, or for TV mounting holes wider than 400mm and unfortunately they aren’t quite long enough to cover 2 studs in all cases. I used a slot to the left of center for a stud and the far right of the bracket was not long enough to reach another stud 16” away. I would have chosen a longer wall mount if I had known the bracket dimensions up front. But thankfully LCD TV’s are pretty light so I’m not too concerned about having to use the drywall option for the right side. At east I have one solid stud connection and it’s close to the center of the TV. There’s a decent assortment of bolts and washers, but even one more spacer option, maybe 1”, would be welcome. The blue plastic pull tabs to release the bracket from the lower rail hang down below the level of my 55” TV and the supplied adhesive magnet strips to attach to the plastic pull tabs don’t stick well, so plan on tucking the pull tabs into the bracket, or wiring, so they are not visible. Overall, this is a very inexpensive mount and will likely work fine in most cases, but based on my experience I can’t rate it much above average.","[]","B0012S4APK","B083TH1B45","AHKMVZJCEEU33TX6E4VGZIWGZRKA","2017-02-05 16:31:01.000","1","True","512"
"201078","4","Outstanding performance and price.","Outstanding performance and price. I rate it a 9 out of 10. Just received this well engineered and constructed hybrid camera. The OSD button is used to chose between Analog HD, TVI, CVI, or analog modes. I use the camera with a Annke DT81Y DVR in TVI mode, purchased through Amazon. The camera delivers excellent color in high definition during the day. For the night, the camera has 4 high powered infrared leds mounted behind a black masking filter and low light technology. The 4 leds are not hidden and are visible as small red dots. I have an Annke camera, purchased through Amazon, which completely hides its powerful leds. The camera comes in a well designed, robust, weatherproof metal case, sunshade, and mounting bracket. The cable is threaded through the mounting bracket to protect it from harsh sun and weather. The camera would get a 10 except for some minor issues. My camera is used to watch a parking lot. The parking lot receives light from three very tall street HID lights illuminating a major commercial 4 lane street, and one parking lot HID lamp. At night the camera delivers a crisp image in very light color that is almost all black and white. The more artificial light from the HID sources the more color. The camera comes with a hex wrench to adjust the variable 2.8mm to 12mm lens. There are two hex nuts under the barrel of the camera. The first nut moves the lense back to increase the magnification. The second nut focuses the image. It was touch and go to get the wrench to fit into the hex holes in the nuts. Once the wrench was finally pushed into place with each nut, turning the nuts was not a smooth and light operation. Force was needed to turn the nuts. There was snapping and popping. Did I break the lens? After moving the lens to the 12mm position, there was no response in trying to focus. I do not give up. My philosophy with any type of mechanical or electronic thing is improvise, and &quot;fix it or break it.&quot; After spending an excessive amount of time messing with the adjusting screws  I wound up with a 12mm, close up, focused image. The last small issue is that the bracket design is mainly for mounting on a vertical surface. It can be adjusted to mount on a horizontal surface, but the mount will not allow the bracket to be adjusted to look down more than 45 degrees from the arm.","[]","B0717195LV","B0717195LV","AFVX4VFCCDZG6FZ7QAX5PM3V44WA","2017-06-25 01:53:23.595","7","True","512"
"442171","4","Stands above the rest","The charging cable market is, to say the least, and until NFC charging becomes standard, crowded. I have tried quite a few, and what can you say? They get the job done, and apart from special colors or thicker shielding, I don’t think anyone really cares about the details.\\n\\nEnter the Native Union, and I was amazed. First of all, ten feet is (as far as I have seen) almost unheard of, a length I have been hoping to see for a long time. The intent is to make a cable that will make in-bed charging a lot more reasonably balanced, and it does, with great ease and length to spare.\\n\\nWhile the cable itself is a high quality and durable cloth covered monster, what really got me was the counterweight, if you will- it’s actually a diminutive monkey’s fist, and beautiful to behold. I don’t know who came up with this, but I have to think they are a little more than casually versed in the art of marlinspike.\\n\\nA cursory glance online shows me they are now used for purposed as varied as a doorstop to a weapon of self-defense to the main deployment handles for sport parachute systems. This pretty much amazed me, (and set me back a bit, but shouldn’t really have done so) since in my mind it’s a little but of a travesty to appropriate something that had it’s origins as a heaving line knot used on ships of sail of yesteryear, and probably still in use amongst sailors who still care.\\n\\nHowever, it seems the knot is now more popular as a decorative knot then was found in my sailing days.\\n\\nIn the case of this cable, I am OK with it as it seems to be an ideal problem for the relatively silly conundrum of how to keep the weight of the extra long cable from pulling out of your device.\\n\\nAnd it works amazingly well. It is consistent with the quality of the cable (if you look at the internal diagram you will see why) but with this well tied sliding knot enables you to place the center of balance anywhere you find will work well. Since the knot typically is tied around a core, I really have to wonder what they used. And no, I never learned to make one, but that could change.","[]","B075JGZFN5","B01KQLAR6O","AHJLBKTQNCUQ3LADRETGMEDXAEVA","2017-11-29 19:56:16.881","1","False","512"

I should have known better. It DOES come with the 1 Canon kit lens. The other 2 lenses are XIT brand and the two of them together can be purchased for less than $20. They actually make the pictures worse. Also, just to note, these are not stand alone lenses. They screw onto the front of the lens like a filter would. These are completely not usable for any kind of quality pictures. An average point and shoot camera takes higher quality pictures than you will get through these lenses.\\n\\nIf this is your first DSLR, the kit provides a decent value. All of the components are cheap, but will give you an idea if those are things you will use and should replace with better versions.\\n\\nThe camera itself is (so far) awesome.

"751980","3","In hindsight, the idea is nice... but if you really want something like this...","This product is sold under a few different names on Amazon and as of the time of me writing this, it's also sold for less by others (found that out after i'd already bought this one. This is the reason for one of the stars not being there. The second star I decided not to give because... well, just read this review. Or skip to the end). The cord that plugs into the wall is a perfect length for my use (5ft), but some may consider it too short. It is of an adequate gauge/thickness though. I was happy to see that. Not that I'd want to plug too much into this thing anyway.\\n\\nAnyway, lets take a step back. First impressions. Received it in a nice box. It was packaged decent and gives a good first impression. The unit itself looks half decent. All of my USB ports work properly and charge my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 at mach 5 with no problems so far... so, it would appear that it's putting out the proper 5v/2.1a. I'm assuming the USB ports are just configured in a series circuit... which is hyped up to be &#34;smart loading&#34;. lol A+ marketing for that. Works well enough though.\\n\\nAs for the outlets themselves... they seem to be no better or worst than your average extension cord. Still, I have my reservations, and won't be plugging anything more than an LED desk light, one or two usb devices to charge, and the occasional soldering pencil, etc.\\n\\nIn hindsight, the idea is nice... but if you really want something like this... just get a good surge protector and plug some usb chargers into it. More likely to work/charge proper, has an on/off switch (most surge protectors do...if not then you didn't get a good one...or even a medicore one...you've got a turd and should dispose of it), it's an actual surge protector (which this is not... it'll just burst into flames (more likely it'll just smoke and melt) along with everything else), and you won't have to worry so much about it being a fire hazard... because I kinda suspect that this thing might be.\\n\\nI'm not convinced that the plastic is fire resistant.

"439941","4","Best iPad Pro Case Available","This is the Best iPad Pro case available in my humble opinion.  Although it is on the expensive side, it checked off the list of things I was looking for in a case\\n\\n- frosted back to show off my new Rose Gold iPad, and no visible fingerprints!\\n- holds the Apple Pencil\\n- works with Apple Smart Keyboard\\n- hand strap in the back that rotates 360, be sturdy to hold in one hand\\n- stand that is completely adjustable so I can find just the perfect angle for every task\\n\\nThis is definitely a well made case that seems to be very high quality, which I'm expecting to last the life of my iPad Pro.  But, there are a few improvements I would like to see to make it perfect for me.  I find the elastic strap that holds my fingers to be tight.  I wear a size 7 ladies gloves, so have average fingers.  At first, it seems fine, but soon becomes rather uncomfortable, as there is a lot of pressure on my fingers even if I only use 2 fingers with it.  I wish it could be looser, or use a leather strap that matches the pencil holder instead.  So much so that I've started using the handle for holding, which works quite well.  I also love how it can turn into a stand or carry handle.  The other issue I have with this case is I wish the exposed (keyboard attachment) side could be enclosed, as it is uncomfortable to hold when I'm not using with a keyboard (which is most of the time). Also, I can see it get banged up/scratch/dented easily.  I wish they offered a version without the cutout, for those of us that may not ever want to use it with the Apple keyboard, or included a cover that can be removed when we want to use it with the keyboard or magnetic cover.\\n\\nI couldn't find any pictures of this case on a Rose Gold iPad Pro when I was shopping, so I hope you find my pictures helpful.  I tried to show how you can hold it, use it as a stand, and I'm very pleased with how it looks with Rose Gold!\\n\\nI hope you found my review helpful. If so, I would greatly appreciate it if you would click the HELPFUL or YES button.

"766192","4","Center dust cap popped off","I purchased a set of these in 2013 for my living room and then another in 2014 for my office. I was happy with the price and quality on installation. My only initial complaints were:\\nThe sharp corners, as another reviewer mentioned and photographed. But once installed this wasn't an ongoing issue.\\nThe name. &#34;Energy Take Classic' sounds like a failed attempt by a low-budget company to assemble English words into an exciting product name. Visiting Energy's web site sort-of dispels this concern.\\n\\nFast forward three years, and when I took the cover off my office room center speaker I discovered the dust cap had popped off, also as another reviewer had already reported. I had been noticing some issues at moderate-high volume, but I attributed this to listening while running on my treadmill. Some of the potential issues with a missing dust cap are:\\nDust and other junk can get into the voice coil gap, degrading performance\\nVenting of the voice coil and speaker may be impacted\\nDegraded sound, especially at high frequency, depending on how the dust cap has been considered in the design of the speaker\\n\\nAs you can see in the attached image, the slightly yellow bead of adhesive was still attached to the cone, but the adhesion to the black cap failed. The cap still made a good fit to the adhesive bead. I tried to pick at the failed adhesive to remove it, but it still stuck quite well to the cone. I chose to just run a new bead of Loctite GO2 gel adhesive on top of the existing adhesive bead, and then push the cap back onto the cone. I then used a toothpick to trace around the circumference of the cap, pushing the cap into the adhesive and hopefully sealing it to the cone.\\n\\nBe careful with selecting a glue; if the viscosity is too low it could run into the voice coil gap and – worst case – glue the speaker together. My glue’s viscosity was borderline too high, making it difficult to get a good seal around the dust cap. I don’t suggest a “super glue” since these are brittle and won’t give you much pot life to align the dust cap.\\n\\nI checked my living room set, and the dust cap is still attached. I'm now wondering if I should check all of the speakers...","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+femqGHqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+femqGHqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+femqGHqL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714b6XY72eL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714b6XY72eL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714b6XY72eL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DeU7omcIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DeU7omcIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DeU7omcIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B001202C44","B001202C44","AEHIQNT2G2CX6TJN2SW2WAYRWLOA","2017-06-25 13:59:11.944","3","True","512"

First off the shipment was okay and arrived very late in the day. I don't fault the company on that but it will add to the overall frustration. So my plan was simple, 3 cables 3 locations. With a week what I thought was a fluke became a pattern. These had no grays and weren't used in some conveluted manner simply plugged into the same style LG fast charger that comes with the LG G5.\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed is the end cable on the middle cable seemed loose and had some play in it. This became blatantly apparent the first time I disconnected the cable from the phone and the shield slid down. No big deal right wrong. The cable kept charging but I would hear the beep as if it was just plugged into the charger about every 15min. Again I didn't think much of it until I noticed it while holding the phone it would stop charging all together and not like a smart charger that detects the battery is full but that there was no charge coming though. Switched chargers and it worked for a few minutes and went back to not charging. Switched cables and worked fine. Went back to the original and started working for about 10min then a new sound came up that stated the charger was charging slower and to switch to a fast charger, which it was already on. Did the cable charger switch again as before all worked but when coming back to the original it remained slowly charging.\\nAt this point I still didn't mind 2 out 3 fast chargers wasn't bad and besides it would still charge just slower. Until of course it didn't.\\nA few days later as I was going about my day with the phone charging at my desk I noticed and heard the distinct chime that the battery was under 15%. But it was on the charger plugged in and simply not charging. Switch cables again to test and working fine, the cable from this company simply stopped working for any device I attached it to.\\nThis exact process has now occured in all threes cables over the course 4 months. One cable I can understand factory defect whatever, two cable I can even kinda let slide annoyingly due to the cost of the cables, but now all three.\\nSo third time's a charm I will definitely stay away from this brand and likely the seller as well.","[]","B01I33N124","B01I33N124","AFWQOKYDYWTDQBLZNCOL3NPY3YHQ","2017-03-23 23:34:55.000","0","True","512"

Maybe I can set Keenai to not do that, or just remove Keenai from my phone.  I can't see myself using EyeFi on the phone again, anyway.\\n\\nIf I want to load photos into my laptop, then those are copied to Shutterfly, which is free, and won't accept duplicates to the cloud.\\n\\nI wish there was a way to download all the photos at one time, like EyeFi, but that also can be a disadvantage in that it clutters up the memory of the phone.\\n\\nI bought this card from Ebay, so it's not a verified purchase.  All in all, I love the Flash Air, and the only real downside other than one at a time downloading is that it's going to slightly reduce battery life, because it comes on and off with the camera.","[]","B00GEBTFNM","B00GEBTFNM","AFD7CCGYBWKW7JXAPTP7LDNY5RDA","2017-02-28 14:44:32.000","0","False","512"

However, iPod music players of a convenient size are going away, so I searched for a high capacity replacement, since I LOVE listening to music.\\n\\nIt takes some getting used to this, after using only an iPod (I used a cassette Walkman before that!), but I am actually very much loving this convenient size, large capacity digital music player. I have a lot of music, but I haven't filled up all the capacity, yet!\\n\\nThe software MediaGo, which is what this Walkman uses, took a little getting used to also, but I have switched from iTunes to using the MediaGo exclusively for my music playing, on my PCs as well as this Walkman.\\n\\nThe color is vivid and shiny and pretty.\\n\\nOnce I learned how to navigate the device, it is pretty easy for me to select my music and go about my day. I am very pleased with this Sony Walkman.\\n\\nThe only &#34;Con&#34; I can think of is not being able to directly &#34;delete&#34; music from the device-- it has to be plugged into the computer and you have to use the MediaGo software.\\n\\nPros:\\nIT PLAYS MUSIC!!!\\nGreat size that can easily fit a pocket (jeans or a men's flannel shirt, because let's face it, &#34;they&#34; don't make women's pockets for anything useful!).\\nBeautiful color.\\nBluetooth ability and audio plug.\\nFairly easy to navigate through music with several options for selecting music (album, artist, genre; easily scroll using 0-Z, which allows for quickly finding what is wanted).\\nCan use the audio plug to connect with my car and then can use headphones when I'm not in my car, so I get to take my music with me everywhere!\\nIt's not bulky.\\nIt's not overloaded with distractions.\\nIt's simple to operate.\\n\\nI recommend Sony's Hi-Res Walkman Digital Player for those who want the simplicity of just music!","[]","B01DPRZ8L0","B01DPRZ8L0","AE6ZJ3WCE6WU44EISXK5RB3GQGNQ","2017-10-10 04:52:23.502","0","True","512"
"764222","4","Good Fidelity for the Money","We needed higher quality desktop audio speakers to move around the house to listen to music or audio books/talks or movies generally hooked to a laptop of iPhone. We needed enough power to overcome the sound of the dishwasher if we were doing chores, but enough sensitivity that we could enjoy an evening symphony while relaxing on the couch. We knew we needed something better than the standard computer desktop speakers that sound tinny or plasticky--but hoped to keep it under $100.  After reading several reviews, it seemed like the M-Audio AV32 might work so we ordered them. Overall, I would say we are pleased with the purchase, We move these around a lot so the compact size is a plus, but they are big enough and sturdy enough to produce some decent bass sound.  The Mid to high notes are almost too accurate; the first song I played I could clearly hear how the vocal harmonies were coming in a tick too late in the original recording, something I would not have discerned in my old JBL tweeter/woofer computer combo.  The first time I heard the clear mids and highs I understood why these are marketed as studio monitors--something designed for sound accuracy/fidelity. So, the accuracy was truly noticeable--not that I am sound engineer or anything.  So, mids and highs sound good--the only thing I miss from my old JBL tweeter and subwoofer is the truly deep bass.  These M-Audio's produce decent bass.  Strange, but sometimes the bass can be quite loud in these speakers particularly if they have a solid wall behind the speakers--but the effect is LOUDNESS not DEPTH.  I miss the depth of a true subwoofer--hence the 4, not 5 in my rating.  But, overall, I am glad for the purchase.  It's fun to listen to such accurate sound reproduction.  My baroque music while making Sunday lunch is charming and the church related talks (human speech) are crystal clear with no distortion almost to the top volume. 10 watts won't make a dance party happen, but the wattage fills my average living room quite nicely, whether playing quietly for a dinner party, or up louder while I am listening to a talk while I get the chores done. If you are looking to upgrade from average computer desktop speakers these will be a SOLID step up and quite enjoyable, but perhaps for $30 bucks more you might get more bass depth out of something.","[]","B00X741TKG","B01B1WQQ76","AFRU73N2JXN6TRR3JIUM5ZPJRSNA","2017-01-02 21:56:55.000","1","True","512"
"990594","5","The good: Plays Grand Theft Auto 5","The good: Plays Grand Theft Auto 5, plays World of Warcraft, plays all kinds of stuff I simply didn't expect it to play. I sold my GTX 660 Ti and relegated my 8 year old Xeon workstation to server duties -- this card was simply a &#34;I need video outputs on the server&#34; card.\\n\\nThen I changed my mind, and sold my i7-2960qm/Quardo 5010M 4gb laptop, and started using the desktop again.\\n\\nI can't believe this card runs almost everything at around 30fps with settings turned down, surprisingly reliably, though not quite perfectly.\\n\\nExtremely impressed. If you want a cheap card that'll impress, and you're not looking to brag up your system to friends who throw a lot of money at theirs, this card is probably a good bet.\\n\\nSpecifically GTA5: I drop the resolution down to get the FPS required for the faster parts, and it delivers. The benchmark rarely dipped under 30FPS. Settings are all pretty much on their lowest, but the game still looks just fine, and plays great, including car chases and shootouts.\\n\\nSpecifically World of Warcraft: runs awesome almost all the time on so-so settings with particles turned up to see spell effects/danger zones on the ground and view distance nudged up a few points. Every once in a while in WoW boss fights it lets me down, and crawls badly enough that tanking becomes more challenging, but it's rare. This includes LFR EN.\\n\\nSkyrim runs pretty choppy. I haven't really made use of it. It doesn't have a way to see FPS that I know of, but I'm guessing it's between 5 and 10 FPS during the first attack.\\n\\nSide note: I have, however, ordered another card to let me crank all the settings up. GeForce Experience is requiring a login now even to run software updates. That bugs me a lot. So, I went with an R9-380 (highest benchmarking card I've ever owned for a great price). My first ATI/AMD card in probably 18 years. Almost entirely because of the login requirement, but also because the price/performance was amazing. $99 for a 380 is fantastic. Passmark has it way faster than my old 660 Ti and for basically the same money.","[]","B01AZ7W88O","B01FGYVWB0","AHEJ32DE5XES46M6NZA7HJIH75AQ","2017-01-02 07:16:42.000","10","True","512"

I tried a FreeNAS server for a while, but had problems with it - reliability, upgrade issues and performance issues. It may be that I hadn't configured it properly, but I thought I'd try a pre-configured system.\\n\\nI started with the ReadyNAS 212 2-bay device, and then moved to the larger ReadyNAS 214. I used camelcamelcamel.com to watch for the price on this device to come down and was able to get it for $365. I've seen it go lower since then.\\n\\nI was able to put new drives in the 214, copy files from the FreeNAS and the 212 onto the new device, and then put the drives from the older devices into the ReadyNAS 214. When copying across my network, I was consistently getting around 70-80 MB/s transfer rates.\\n\\nThe 3GB drive I added took about 12+ hours to sync up on the ReadyNAS 214. Once it was done, total available space was increased. Netgear has a great calculator to figure out how much available space you have based on the types of drives you add to your storage device: http://rdconfigurator.netgear.com/raid/index.html.\\n\\nThe other thing I like about the ReadyNAS is that it's easy to set up users and restrict permissions to shares on the NAS device. I set up users with the same passwords they use on their local Windows workstations, and also set up authentication to be the same name as my local Windows &#34;workgroup&#34;. This allowed users to access the NAS with the permissions I gave them (read or read/write) without having to remember a new username and password.\\n\\nI haven't gotten into the apps much. I ran a Plex app on the ReadyNAS 212, but it honestly performed better on Plex clients using a Windows Plex Server and just having it pull the media files off of the ReadyNAS 214. I may try to set it up again on the ReadyNAS 214, but it's not a priority for me right now.\\n\\nSince I've had this device, I've also gotten several updates to the ReadyNAS OS, so it appears that ReadyNAS is still invested in maintaining the platform.\\n\\nOverall, a very good experience and I highly recommend the ReadyNAS 214 device.","[]","B015S0Y50C","B015S0Y50C","AGLXHJOO7W4MRRPUHITY2MYQC24A","2017-09-02 13:19:14.482","6","True","512"

It is mediocre. The lighting sensor, which responds to ambient levels and proximity of the hands, is quite clever. The keys work well for a TV keyboard, where a firm detent, with positive feel, are all that's needed. The keys have little travel. It doesn't approach the best desktop keyboards.\\n\\nWhere the design falls down is with the touch pad. The design of the pad might include a power saving feature. Otherwise, how can I explain that if I am careful, I can slowly drag my finger a half inch along the touch pad surface without moving the screen pointer? It seems to have a sleep mode. If my finger is a crafty burglar, it can avoid waking up the pad. So I can't just &#34;let my finger do the walking.&#34; I have to pay attention. I have to stroke the pad just right, or it will remain in snoring slumber.\\n\\nIt wouldn't be so hard to stroke the pad just right, except there are no mouse buttons for my left hand. To use the buttons, I have to move my finger away from the pad and onto the buttons. Then my finger has to reacquaint itself with the mouse pad to get the pad to stop snoring.\\n\\nThe surface of the touch pad isn't too good either. It is perfectly smooth, with no textured. My finger, which is actually clean, gets stuck on the pad. As I jerk it loose, my finger skitters over the pad like it doesn't belong to me. Who would have thought that a finger could be so complicated? The lack of a textured surface is probably due to cost. Textures tend to wear. There are textural materials that present a wear resistant surface, but they cost. Hence Logitech has chosen a smooth material. Maybe I should spray some frying grease on the pad. Then my finger would be finger-lickin good.\\n\\nThe Logitech software reports that the K830 has firmware, and gives a version number. Logitech could solve the problem of the sleeping touch pad with a firmware update, at the cost of some battery life. They could also offer a free adhesive applique for the pad, to give it some needed texture.\\n\\nLogitech, are you listening?","[]","B00ZOPVSKW","B08PBS5CBX","AFSAOGDIPKC2QYAHRQJSIRGEQETQ","2017-11-28 01:37:46.229","1","True","512"

(Read whole review for gaming/daily use review of the 27"" monitor)","The screen is amazing and crystal clear (I haven't changed the settings at all, I've been using what they set it to). For the price of $296, at the time (Late November), it was perfect and still is! The text even looks amazing on this display. The custom color adjustments LG did to my monitor (as it came out of the factory) make it look rich, and accurate with its colors. I've had no problems with this display and it was worth every penny. The stand does tilt up and down a little but not much. There is no height adjustment on the monitor (None of these are cons to me; I don't need them). It is only at 60Hz, however I'm not going to spend like $500 or $800 on a 144Hz 1440p or 4k monitor. Most of them are TN panels and this is IPS. Honestly, everyone I know doesn't &#34;just game&#34; on their systems (which TN is supposed to be for). They use it for web browsing, YouTube, word, etc. With having multiple uses for my system, IPS is the main choice for me and has never let me down. The colors on IPS are accurate and better than TN. Sooner or later, with-in the next five years, 4k will be like 1080p/1440p is today for gaming. Nvidia is releasing Volta in early 2018 (from what I'm reading) and it's supposed to be able to handle 4k way better than the Pascal cards can. Although, currently I do have a Maxwell, EVGA GTX 960 SSC 4GB, which I overclocked a good amount (it's stable) and I'm getting very stable frames (no screen lagging at all on Rainbow Six). I have the settings on high with no problems (I could go higher but I'm limited to 4GB of GDDR5). Yes there is small amounts screen tearing here and there, however this is just temporary. I'm planning to either get a EVGA GTX 1080 SC2 or waiting for the Volta cards to come out. Honestly, the Maxwell cards are already out-of-date in a way. The games are demanding more graphics memory today and the Maxwell cards are running low on the amount of memory available. Especially with higher resolutions, the graphics card and computer will need more RAM. People have been recommending 16GB for system RAM and at least 6GB of GDDR5 for the graphics card. Hope this helps!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714NYIdCcEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714NYIdCcEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714NYIdCcEL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FrNOAIw5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FrNOAIw5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FrNOAIw5L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01IRQAYPE","B01IRQAYPE","AG5PGKUXT4Z36BDPQ5KTIO3OUDGA","2017-12-14 01:48:46.675","2","True","512"
"536318","4","Pretty good antenna, pros and cons. Fine for me but may not be the right choice for you.","This is a pretty good antenna, and overall I'm happy with my purchase. It has its good and bad points. First, I was not at all impressed with the packaging. The parts were basically just dumped into the box to rattle around against each other as the orangutans at the shipping service probably dropped the box from a great height at least once before it arrived. But to my amazement there were only a few minor dings so no harm done. The instructions were sufficient for me to easily assemble the antenna and get it going in minutes. It seems to be of very good quality construction, though there does seem to be a lot of torque tension on the single mount due to the fairly large size of the antenna. If I had mounted it outside in the wind and weather I think I would have added a non-conductive support to the midpoint of the horizontal element,  either a strut from the bottom or a support line from the top to take stress off the mount. But I did an attic install so it was not an issue, though my rafters limit viable locations and my range of adjustment room. I had to do a bit of planning to ensure I got it right but it fits fine.\\n\\n I live in Charleston, SC. tvfool.com says most of my digital tv stations are 25 mile away at an angle of 45 degrees from my house, with some oddball stations at approximately 330 degrees and 10 to 60 miles out. I pointed to 45 degrees and used a 50 foot quad shield cable. The good news is Tvfool says I should get a max of 13 channels, and I get 18. The clarity is astonishing for an antenna, much better than my Comcast picture. The bad news is the signal strength to not that great considering the stations are so close, and signal  strength varies widely at different times of the day. Some channels still look fine but have signal strength  barely above zero (as indicated by my smart tv) or don't come in at all in the early evening, but are there with decent signal strength in the early morning. The first time I tuned my TV for antenna stations in the evening I only got 15. A second tv tune in the early morning brought in 18 stations. As far as I can tell I receive nothing from the 330 degree stations, even though they are only 10 miles away in North Charleston. But these are primarily Spanish speaking channels or redundant channels to the ones at 45 degrees so that doesn't bother me.","[]","B01ET7BIQY","B01ET7BIQY","AHWUFOVKJIF342BCDG2IURAQYNWA","2017-03-22 10:14:52.000","4","True","512"
"646616","4","Works great, especially for the price","Long gone is the day where you throw in a LP sit back and relax to some smooth good music, right? Well in the past couple years turntables are coming back and so are records. So should you get back into new old music technology?\\n\\nThe answer is complicated for one main reason, money. How much do you want to spend for music? Now if you are like me you may have kept your records of old and maybe even a set of speakers but you will still need speaker wire and a receiver. Now if you have nothing be prepared for a good chunk of money going into the audio system.\\n\\nSo let's first focus on the brand new setup. My first tip is check second hand stores like goodwill or go on Craigslist. I have found amazing speakers for under $30. So don't think you have to run out there and buy a $300 set of speakers. But if you can the more power to you, chances are better sound will be accomplished by a new receiver and speakers. Now for vinyl. Each record can cost between $12-$50 depending on popularity and 2LPs drive up cost too. However most can be has for about $25.\\n\\nNow if you do have some equipment all that is probably common knowledge but don't dismiss second hand goods.\\n\\nNow onto the record player itself.\\n\\nIt's form factor is quite sleek with a modern look and eye catching logo on the felt. The controls are pretty easy to use and make for seamless ease of use. The dust cover can get, well, dusty so I would recommend cleaning it to keep I the whole setup looking good.\\n\\nNow onto sound quality. For me there is something so satisfying about hearing the needle drop and a good song play. However this is where you may want to just invest in a CD player if you don't care for sentiment. The music sounds great but unless you are comparing sound quality side by side or you are an extreme audiophile you just won't be able to tell a difference. This said I still love the novelty of having a record player and it is a good conversation piece as well. But should you buy one? Well unless you really want that nostalgic feel of music or you think vinyl does sound better, probably not. I'm not sayin g don't buy it but as far as practicality goes, cell phones and wireless receivers are really the way to go.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6117LqvrXjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6117LqvrXjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6117LqvrXjL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Sv68smI8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Sv68smI8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Sv68smI8L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711NkBD9q9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711NkBD9q9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711NkBD9q9L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712P51CzcsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712P51CzcsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712P51CzcsL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qjKSQptKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qjKSQptKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qjKSQptKL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B008872SIO","B00U6Y9CHW","AGPGUNWUM6L2TRO35NFZGZA22W6Q","2017-11-23 15:43:48.144","3","True","512"

We're gamers and also watch a lot of Netflix and had been avoiding the living room because of various issues with the previous TV (it was getting old and starting to show it) and now I look for any excuse to use it! Beautiful picture! I wasn't familiar with Roku before and love the streaming features and being able to set what your inputs are. Only disappointment is there is no Twitch channel on the Roku to stream; I guess there was problems with it. But if you're into Twitch, you most likely already have a system to stream it off of.\\n\\nI was worried about the sound from other reviews, but apparently I'm not much of an audiophile as it sounds alright to me. Would love to upgrade to a sound bar in the future but for now I can wait.\\n\\nI also heard it could be a problem if you suffer from glare as the tv isn't able to get bright enough. We have curtains facing the opposite way and sometimes little glints of light get through. We also have skylights overhead. I was worried, but again, everything seems fine. I wouldn't fault those issues to a tv and more of a spacing/bad time of the day deal but maybe that's just me.\\n\\nI loaded up Zelda Breath of the Wild for the first time on the Switch as well as a 4k tv, and all I can say is OMG. No other words for it.\\n\\nIf you are looking for good tv to upgrade to with a great price, this seems like a fantastic choice! Time will tell on the longevity of course but my first impressions cause me to have 0 regrets. I'm glad I didn't wait for the Black Friday or Cyber Monday deals (for refenrence, I got this for $400 with free shipping).\\n\\nOn a final light note, I had it routed to a fed ex store because the shipping took less time than stated and I was out of town for the weekend. The fed ex employee was very sad to let this one go. It was a little awkward hahaha!

"318199","1","Don't waste your money","This product was a total disappointment. I live in the North East and have a hard time waking up in the winter time when it's really dark out, so I was looking forward to simulating a small sunrise in my bedroom to help my body wake up naturally. There are a few things wrong with the design of this clock:\\n\\n1) After 30 mins of the light getting progressively lighter so that you can wake up, the clock starts beeping in a very obnoxious tone. It's very similar to the noise that a regular red LED clock from the dollar store makes. Basically, if you don't manage to wake up in 30 minutes you get the &#34;rude awakening&#34; experience.\\n2) The clock is very lightweight, so if you push any button (like trying to turn the obnoxious alarm off) you push it off the nightstand. It's basically a two-handed operation, so you better be very coordinated early in the morning if you are trying to push any buttons.\\n3) All the buttons on the front are the same size. You have to remember where they are oriented in space on the front of the clock to determine which one to push. However, at this point the clock is probably already on the floor because you have frantically been trying to turn off the obnoxious alarm noise... This seems like extra work when I'm sleepy.\\n\\nSome pros:\\n\\n1) I think the concept overall is great, and I wish they had executed it better. Maybe I shouldn't have skimped and gotten the $120 version.\\n2) The brightness of the red LED time can be dimmed so that the numbers are not too bright at night (I really like that feature, but during the day they are barely visible and the clock becomes useless)\\n\\nOverall, this product did not work out for me. Mainly I found that when I'm sleepy, my body turns away from the light to catch some more Zzzs and then I get the obnoxious alarm to start blaring. When I did use the clock, it would usually end up on the floor because of the silly button design. Instead, I've been using the Sleepcycle app on my iPhone, which wakes you up when you are in your lightest sleep phase. It was free and has a selection of really nice wake up alarm sounds. I wish I could get my money back for the clock :(","[]","B00F0W1RIW","B00F0W1RIW","AEFOHARYRXWGVXPJX7NPK5AN6HNA","2017-03-21 10:58:13.000","11","True","511"
"363241","2","quality control issues!","I am extremely disappointed with asus, I always have been and I always will be! I bought a laptop from them a LONG time ago back in 2007 and it was really thin, I thought it’d be a great school machine but it was a train wreck. It had no battery life literally out of the box less than 3 hours! And was riddled with overheating issues. I have sworn them off since and I saw this ultra-book on sale and thought ya know I’ll give them another shot since so many other people seem to love this laptop.\\nWELL all was great except the most idiotic quality control I have ever seen!!!! One of the keys was depressed and I thought maybe its just stuck. Well turns out the blasted rubber cup was GONE!! I mean broken I can understand but GONE! It looks like someone put it on there and then cut it off NOT GINGERLY AT ALL!!!! I have been angry about product quality control but this is unreasonable! Now I have to buy a new keyboard but this laptop is too new to find any replacement cups for it!\\nI found a replacement keyboard on ebay that seems identical button for button that came from a sister model and ill be ordering that soon but I am NOT looking forward to taking this thing apart as the return services will be charging me 35 dollars to send it back and its needed right NOW.\\nI swear on my life, my children’s lives, and my children’s children’s lives that I will NEVER buy another asus product ever again, they are a worthless brand that doesn’t give a dam about the customer or end user! They sell half assed products that are not tested properly or designed with quality in mind. This is why Huawei and apple and google are doing so well.\\nAsus has officially lost a customer for life, I will cringe every time I have to use that dam thing and right now I don’t have an S key period so need to fix that asap, I put a temporary cup underneath until I get the full replacement for it.\\n\\nother than that glaring issue the laptop seems to work decently and has good sound and connectivity and good battery life. i dont like that track pad but i knew i wouldn't going into this so i was prepared. I leave two stares cause it at least has the performance to do what i needed it to do but that dam keyboard issue is Bull","[]","B01M18UZF5","B084LVVQ7F","AFRSXBESXJIUPZ76GIZB6U7BGSFA","2017-10-20 19:38:35.344","0","True","511"
"407050","1","then you will probably say this is good. However","If you have not used other video doorbells before, then you will probably say this is good.  However, if you have then stay far away from this doorbell.  August still has many to improve and if you are looking to upgrade like me, don't.  It will be a downgrade.  This product is inferior to other doorbells.\\n\\n1.  The audio is only a 1 way.  So you have to hold &#34;talk&#34;  in order to talk to the person at the door.  During this, you can't hear them. You have to release your &#34;talk&#34; to hear them. Again, coming from a RING doorbell where 2 way communication is easy and present.  With this doorbell, you can't do that. This is a huge set back.\\n2.  When you do answer the ring, it takes a long time for you to see who is at the door.  The lag time is pretty bad and like another reviewer said, you might be quicker to just walk to your front door and let them in because it takes so long just to view.\\n3.  Coming from a night camera, this camera does not have night vision.  Reading reviews, you will hear that the picture is pretty good still at night.  Wrong, its pretty bad.\\n4.  Installation could be better.  Over complicating the installation when it doesnt need to be.  Including cheap wall anchors is another drawback.  I had to use better quality anchors because the ones included was very cheap.\\n5.  The motion sensor does not work at all.  No matter what setting i used.  It could of just been the unit i had, but for me it did not work at all. I could literally wave my hand in front of the doorbell and never got an alert.\\n\\nSo with all these problems, why did i even upgrade or try to upgrade from ring?  I was trying to integrate my doorbell with their smart lock. I figured if i had the smart lock along with the doorbell, that would be a nice combination.  That didnt happen.  The doorbell left a bad taste in my mouth and i ended up returning my smart lock as well without even installing it because i just don't trust the development from August.  First impressions count and so far it was not good.","[]","B015SLMKJY","B015SLMKJY","AH6RTMJARXZOJV4KOOY7HMOQ2FCA","2017-02-24 00:20:10.000","1","False","511"
"15708","4","Sleak, Fast, Affordable","Acer Aspire 1 a114-31-c4hh Notebook is a light weight, low cost laptop. Its dark charcoal carbonate body is slim and a reasonable size for portability versus yesteryear's models. The 14 inch screen displays an impressive high definition resolution. It has HDMI, USB 3.0 x1 and USB 2.0 x2 ports, headphone port, WiFi (2.4 Ghz and 5G), Bluetooth 4.0 and all the basics one would expect from recent laptops. It comes with 4 gigs of ram and a quad core Celeron N3450, is power efficient, and can bump up to a 2.2 Ghz speed when needed. The graphics, based on Intel technology, are exceptional. The sound-quality of the from the speakers are also impressive – loud, clear and articulated eliminating the need for a side device such as in-line Bluetooth speakers.\\n\\nWindows 10 comes installed on this model. I'm not a big fan of Windows and didn't expect much from its performance-wise (to say the least). That turned out incorrect. I found that Win10 was quite snappy for all basic computing -- office, surfing, streaming. It comes with some bloat like recommended programs and games, but once most of these were uninstalled I was left with about 12 gigs out the box of free hard drive space. Twelve gigs is not much too work with,  but this device is designed as a notebook and not an full laptop. I therefore use an SD in for storage.\\n\\nThe battery power is better than average, giving many hours of use and virtually no loss during sleep/standby. If this had a number pad, it may have scored higher with me in the office use experience (bad for number crunchers), but the keys are laid out comfortably with great space between each key. One notable deficit in this Acer, however,  is very slow downloads over WiFi. I compared its download speeds via WiFi with those of other notebooks and computers in my home to the detriment of the Acer. Fortunately the Acer has a Ethernet I use for great speeds via that connection.\\n\\nI highly recommend this machine for professional types and people who want a reliable device that provides all the essentials of everyday computing need. I would rank it as a particularly good choice for those on a budget – it performs at the level of a more expensive machine.

"72484","5","Works perfectly, even with OtterBox case. High quality with extra little features that make it well worth the money.","I love the Samsung DeX station but was very disappointed when I found out that I couldn't use the station since my phone has a rugged case on it. This was the perfect solution and kept my new DeX from being a paperweight. The connector female end is solid and is deep enough to fully seat on the plug in the DeX cradle, and the connector / cable rests perfectly against the back of the DeX so there isn't any real strain on the connector. The cable is a little stiff since it is so thick, but I'm a fan of quality cables and a little manual encouragement got the cable to lay right. The male end of the cable is also sturdy and is longer than most USB cable ends, which makes it easy to get a good grip when inserting into and removing from the phone. I have an Otterbox Defender case on my phone, which can be notorious for difficult cable connections, but this plug fit just fine and had no interference issues with the case. The longer cable plug molding actually helps get around the interference caused by the open Otterbox port cover. Performance-wise it works perfectly; there's no difference between the phone being docked and using this cable. I was worried about charging since the DeX has a built-in Qi charger and I was concerned they might be doing something odd with the USB port to move enough data, but the phone charges just fine using this cable and the DeX, and it provides the high-rate charging that the S8 / N8 phones cry for. Overall, I was a little apprehensive about this purchase at first but with the specific application description and being from a quality brand like Spigen, I took a chance. I'm glad I did, I've been extremely happy and it turned out to be a great product.\\n\\nOne recommendation: I purchased this short cable, intending to set the phone near the DeX as shown in the product photo. Now that I have played with it for a week, I see that the DeX is really just in the way since the cable is the only connection to the phone. I'm going to order a longer cable so I can relocate the DeX unit off my desk and just have the cable itself for the phone to reduce desktop clutter. I recommend that buyers consider how they're going to set up their desk after they install this cable, and perhaps buy a longer version of this cable from Spigen if they plan to relocate the DeX station out of sight.","[]","B071VN1JFW","B071VN1JFW","AH4UIGUFEHP4ZYHVYLKZQPF76MVA","2017-11-17 18:46:26.502","2","True","511"

We have beautiful furniture, our backdrops are wall mounted, and even our studio strobes are nice and neat.\\n\\nWhen we opened in January, my wife upgraded her camera to a 6D full-frame, and got a 24-70mm f2.8L to go with it. I then inherited her 7D and higher end Sigma lens. This was fine, as she was the main shooter (I am still working 30-hours a week until we are fully established).\\n\\nIf you know anything about photography and walked into my studio, my camera was the only thing that stuck out as not belonging. I even upgraded my lens to a 24-105 f4L, but I couldn't help but feel as if the body was holding me back.\\n\\nPlease do not misunderstand--the 7D really is a great camera. I wouldn't hesitate to say it's the best crop sensor camera on the market, but it just wasn't the same as a full frame.\\n\\nThis past week I jumped on a very lucky opportunity that came my way to acquire a 5D Mark ii. I knew it was used, but the pictures I saw made it look to be in very good condition, and the other person wanted to trade it for my 7D plus a few other items I didn't really use.\\n\\nWhen I showed up to make the trade, the 5D Mkii was in the original box, the original bubble wrap, with the warranty and everything. She told me it was only used three or four times.\\n\\nIt was essentially brand new. The low light capabilities are phenomenal. The AF is incredibly fast. The colors are brilliant and vibrant. I like my wife's 6D, but truthfully I think the 5D mkii is a better camera overall. The shots are just more crisp and commanding. Paired with my 24-105 L Series every shot is magnificent.\\n\\nI usually use three point lighting in the studio with a high key, so my f stop is usually high. The extent to which everything is unbelievably crisp cannot even be put into words.\\n\\nI am usually happy with anything Canon makes, but the 5D MKii is a professional photographers dream.","[]","B001G5ZTLS","B001G60DUE","AGPCHDK7SMOPVBDTJYL4MAX5WD3Q","2017-06-25 00:06:24.784","2","False","511"
"100220","3","Cheap and average tablet with low quality feel","This tablet isn't bad for a $100 - $115 dollar tablet when on sale.  If not on sale, it's barely adequate as a $150 - $165 dollar tablet.\\n\\nThe build quality is what you'd expect from a cheap tablet.  It's made of plastic and feels low quality.  A little squeeze on the body and you'll feel the plastic flex and hear little popping noises.\\n\\nThe screen is average.  Ok resolution at 1080p, but the picture itself is of averaging to below average quality.  Lots of glare and colors are a little washed out.  Battery life is respectable, it'll go a few days on stand by and 6+ hours under media consumption.  The cameras are absolute junk.  Pretty grainy and just plain poor pictures even in bright light conditions.  They really seem like they are digitally zoomed in way to much causing these horrible pictures.  I'm attaching a quick one I snapped for reference, this was taken with the rear camera.  Granted, you probably aren't going to use a tablet for much picture taking, but there is little point to even having them on the tablet with how poor they are.  The speakers are adequate.  Nothing amazing, a bit tinny as expected from small speakers, but I've heard much worse on higher priced devices before.\\n\\nOn the software side, I've never particularly cared for Amazon's launcher for android.  It feels cluttered to me.  It also feels like something centered around trying to direct you to an Amazon service to spend more money, which is probably their intention, but don't make it feel so obvious! lol.  If you go through the trouble to manually install Google Play so that you can access the entire play store software library, the software experience gets a lot better.  The always listening Alexa capability is one of the best things about the software updates on this generation of fire.  It essentially makes this tablet an Echo Show, but with a much larger display and a lower price.  It just doesn't have as good of speakers as the Echo show.\\n\\nSo overall, this is a low quality cheap tablet.  But, that is what you are paying for.  I give it 3 stars only because it's probably one of the better tablets in it's price category.  If it would improve on a few things they could easily make me want to give it a 4 star review.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SjgSk8EbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SjgSk8EbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SjgSk8EbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01J6RPDWC","B01MTF2Z37","AFH23JSGQS4ICPUR5H6CEEOC6RTA","2017-11-28 01:31:28.878","3","True","511"
"14211","3","So-so performance and bad documentation with not helpful tech support","First, this isn't a bad product. I decided to keep it after all, but there are some concerns here. First, they had no knowledge of what the K.O.DAK attack was on these powerline Ethernet adapters when I contacted tech support. I had asked if they were vulnerable, and they had no idea what I was talking about or didn't want to answer. I found the documentation to basically not even mention the web interface to these devices. They have no firmware updates to them and, if I understand their tech support person correctly, they don't need them because it is not connected to the internet. As an IT architect with a security background, I know this to be a poor argument/statement. Further, the point of the K.O.DAK vulnerability is that the attacker doesn't need to come from the Internet to compromose your network. In any case, their web interface seemed to be a generic chipset vendor OEM web interface that they may not have even designed. Probably why they don't mention these I interfaces even exist or offer firmware updates.  Anyway, big problem in my book as they have three user accounts on each device interface and you need to change them to secure it down. The only way I found which IP interface was each plug was to ping them and the longest average RTT was the plug furthest away from my computer from a network perspective.  No real easy way to figure it out.\\n\\nSo you may ask: Why did he keep it?\\n\\nWell, it was working, met my needs for bandwidth despite it reading about a 100/230  megabit tx/RX connection through the power lines in a standard 2500sqft house where the devices are less than 25ft from each other even if the wiring isn't direct. The other brand seemed more expensive for the same capability and it would have been a pain to return it. So I kept it.\\n\\nWould I recommend this product?  No.  Two reasons. No name company that doesn't yet have a reputation. Second, they aren't serious about providing good support for their products because they clearly don't want you to even know about the web interface much less provide you any firmware updates for it.  While Netgear or the others may not be known for high quality tech support or long term product support, I would venture to say you will find their documentation to be more complete and they will offer some firmware updates at least.","[]","B00Y3XRRI8","B00Y3XRRI8","AGS3SZXGSL7AC5VYOOYPHGILUMEQ","2017-01-09 05:19:02.000","2","True","511"

Also, I purchased a top notch 1080p set just before 4k sets became available.  I am glad I waited because the Q7F is an awesome and fully formed product full of innovations beyond the 4k resolution.\\n\\nBefore I get to those innovations, I do have to say that the 4k/HDR picture is amazing.  Watching UHD videos will set your eyes on fire with the brightness and detail.  Even non-4k content looks great in the HDR+ Mode.  While I wish I could spring for a SpectraCal colorimeter (which is able to calibrate the Q7F automatically), the picture looked great out of the box for my family.\\n\\nMatching the Q7F with a PS4 Pro creates an amazing gaming experience.  The level of detail shown in games is astounding.  My son is playing Madden 18 constantly and you would swear that it is a game on the NFL Network.  Also, we have seen no issues with lag when playing first person shooter games.\\n\\nThe Invisible Connection and One Connect Box allow you to run one cable to the TV along with the power cord.  Gone are the days of squeezing your arm behind the TV to check a cable or plug something new in.  Just plug it in the much more convenient box,  Plus the remote allows you to control everything plugged - including the PS4 which I could never get my expensive universal remote to control.  The universal goes to another room now.  It is no longer needed.\\n\\nThe Smart View Picture feature finally gives me a place to watch all of the UHD videos I have been filming on my Galaxy S8.  One button to push on my phone and boom - my home videos are on my 55 inch TV looking like broadcast television.  Same thing goes for showing photos directly from my phone to the TV.\\n\\nI recently had a group of people over to watch a fight on PPV and people could not believe that the TV was only 55 inches.  Because of its no bezel design, it looks larger (and more stylish).  We had no issue with viewing angles and had people dispersed throughout the room.\\n\\nI can definitely say that I would recommend the Q7F to friends.  In fact, I already have.","[]","B01NAYM6JQ","B01NAYM6JQ","AHIILAKODP5Z6YQRONHPCF7CR5KA","2017-09-20 02:48:49.260","1","False","511"

This is my 4th build and for the first time ever I felt a company really focused on the CASE and nothing else.  Aesthetically the Enthoo Evolv is beautiful especially in this age of LED RGB lighting on MB's and cases.  I was a little nervous with tempered glass being on the side where we typically manage cables, but once the build was complete I realized the thought Phanteks placed on the cable routing holes and rubber grommet placement was very strategic.  What I appreciated most is the removable rack at the top of the case for fans or radiators.  I was able to mount my 240mm H100i v2 extreme AND evga 1080 hybrid  radiator to the top rack and leave the rest of the case for my intake and exhaust fans.\\n\\nThe case comes with multiple drive mounts for HDD's or SSD's as well as a nice organized box with every screw you need for the chassis.  If you are going to by a traditional hard drive I would recommend a 2.5 inch hard drive to match the already included two mounts on the cable management side of the case but its not necessary since there are drive bays for regular sized HDD's.\\n\\nI have traditionally bought mid-full tower cases with sound dampening and efficient air cooling in mind.  This is my first venture into closed loop water cooling and air cooled chassis and I love the versatility that the case allows for either custom built water cooling system, AIO system or air cooling.\\n\\nThe only thing I can see being an issue for some is the lack of an area for an optical drive.  The easiest solution would be to just buy an external drive but if that is something you do not like than this case might not be for you.  The front panel where the optical drive bays would typically be stored are taken over by a heavy feeling aluminum front cover used to mask the intake fans where you can house 2 140mm fans OR 3 120 mm fans based on what your needs are.\\n\\nWhat I liked:\\nStyle\\nTempered Glass\\nCable management systems\\nAir and water cooling versatility\\n\\nWhat I dislike:\\nNothing to dislike.  If anything it would have been nice to have a shield cover for my power supply but I am just being nitpicky at this point.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614u6zAXxjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614u6zAXxjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614u6zAXxjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Xkqr7z5tL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Xkqr7z5tL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Xkqr7z5tL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZHUZm54TL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZHUZm54TL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZHUZm54TL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PZGcpEBoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PZGcpEBoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PZGcpEBoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01F0KWTXA","B071DTXTFW","AG76ISJCQ52FVZJGJ2A4I4DOSUSA","2017-01-24 17:31:16.000","2","True","511"

Here are some limitations you should make sure are OK:\\n1) it only has 4 ethernet ports -- I'm a single guy -- and I'm using all of them.  Yeah, you can buy 100MB/s hub -- but at that point, you might as well spend a few bucks more and get a unit with a few more;\\n2) it has a USB2 and a USB3 port for attaching drives which you can share internally and/or extermally.  For some strange reason, the fast port (the one you want to hang your 1TB back-up drive off of) is on the FRONT of the unit -- so you have a cable snaking out of the front all the time.  The slow USB (which you'd expose to the outside world, because your cable modem upload limit is the speed constraint is in the rear.)\\n3) You can share individual folders both internally and externally, but the drive sharing access control is pitiful and there are no quotas.  Your choices are READ, or READ/WRITE (no DEPOSIT), either with a password (all shares must use the same password), or no password.\\n4) Be forewarned that the Windows CIFS (aka Samba aka Windows drive sharing) protocol works OK with Windows 7, but doesn't sometimes doesn't work under Windows 10. I traced the problem down to the fact that the router sets himself as a CIFS &#34;Master Browser&#34; node, even if there is already another &#34;Master Browser&#34; node on your subnet (and Windows Networking requires there be only 1 master).  Unfortunately, there is no option to configure the router to NOT assume he is the Master browser&#34;.  So, if you are running Windows 10, you may find you need to reboot your windows machine in order to connect to the shared USB drives.\\n5) There are some additional networking modules you can enable, but they don't go beyond what has been the norm for the past decade.  If you a highly configurable router, this is NOT the unit for you.  As I said, I got it because it was the cheapest high-speed 802.11n router avail when I bought it, and it met my needs.","[]","B00F0DD0I6","B00F0DD0I6","AH54GVYJPSQP27FFFMCJ43FOXWYQ","2017-04-22 05:06:35.000","2","True","511"

Update: I bought this device with a great expectation.  I am a newbee when it comes to AI voice control.  The setup procedure was confusing and not very clear.  I don't own a smart phone or the required Logitech remote.  I used MS Windows 7 on my laptop to setup the device. The only option that would not work was entering the Friendly Names.  For some reason, the application would not accept any input.  I had to skip that section of the setup.  The basic functions of turning on/off the TV and cable box seems to work, as the channel changing function.  I would still like to see a way to get to the guide listing via voice control.  I hope that additional work and functions will be included in future software updates. This is a great idea....but poor implementation.  I know IR control is a one way street without a feed back loop.  The device works but functionally is limited. Bluetooth link with the cable box and TV would be much better.  I hope Logitech works on their software to improve functionally in future releases. Considering the popularity of this device paired with Amazon's Echo, it would be in their favor to improve the software for TV control. Update: still working on getting this hub to allow voice control access to the channel guide on my Motorola cable box. Contacted support and they enabled the Guide Command, what ever that is. After syncing again it now brings up the TV speaker slide bar on the screen instead of the channel guide on the cable box. I am giving up trying and will live with it's limitations. This technology is a work in progress and needs  further refinement. It is good and reliable for the basic functions of turning on your TV, changing channels, and volume. Update: I increase the star rating one star even though I have giving up trying to educate the hub to go to the cable box  channel guide. The last time I put the unit on my laptop, the firmware for the hub was updated and I noticed that the red icon is now included into the blue app. After reinstalling the new software and re-syncing the Samsung sound bar now works and the unit seems to be more reliable. I am hoping that Dilbert the software engineer will keep working on new functions and eliminating the bugs.

There was no HDMI cable, but the inclusion of everything else helps prevent the cheap-o feel that you get when companies decide not to give you anything that you may need to get going.\\n\\nConnectivity options are sufficient, but I think the projector would have benefited from the addition of a Display Port input.  However, conversion from DP to HDMI is pretty simple and so it's not a deal breaker by any means.\\n\\nDid I mention how rich the color is?\\n\\nOne thing I thought was odd was that when I turned it off, the fan didn't keep running, despite the fact that the air blowing out while it was on was quite hot.  I don't think I've ever seen a projector that doesn't continue to run the fan for several seconds after turning off the bulb.  I hope that doesn't shorten the life of the lamp--those things are expensive...\\n\\nI liked that the horizontal keystone adjustment was as simple as dragging the lever on the top, just like the focus and picture size.  That made it VERY easy to adjust.  Awesome.  The A/V mute is a nice feature for use in business applications, which I happen to know from experience, and so I'm happy to see that, too.\\n\\nIt's easy to see right off the bat that this is a top-notch projector.  Well, OK--I'm sure there are better ones out there, but the fact that this one is well under $1000 puts it at the top of its class.  If you are looking for great projector that won't break the bank, you should seriously consider this one.","[]","B073L7BSK7","B0B8VM27N6","AFGM3WALHHNWCL3WI75IQQTENANA","2017-11-22 03:26:57.800","2","False","511"

I didn't use the 5GHz signal on my old D-Link because the signal wasn't reliable from more than 10 or 15 feet. I use Spectrum (old Timewarner) and I get 139 Mbps download on the 2.4GHz connection, 236 Mbps on the 5GHz. I'm getting 236 Mbps on my wired computer, so the 5GHz is presumably limited by the service I'm getting from Sprctrum. I switched our phones and other wifi devices to use the 5GHz signal. I noticed after set up that my wired desktop was running at 10/100 instead of gigabit (amber light instead of white), I suspect it was doing that on the old router and I didn't notice, so I replaced the Cat 5E cable with Cat 6 and it flipped to gigabit, so my old Cat 5e probably had a crimp or something.\\n\\nInteresting back story: On Sat April 15, 2017 my wife's computer died (won't power up) and it apparently took the router down with it, an electrical problem apparently shot across the ethernet cable (not sure which was the culprit, the computer or the router). I was working on my taxes, trying to finish before Easter Sunday, so having the timing of these problems was terrible. Wife's sentiment: &quot;That's what you get for waiting until the last minute.&quot; I was able to get internet access for my computer by connecting to the cable modem directly and started hunting for a new router. I finally settled on the NETGEAR Nighthawk X4 AC2350 when I noticed that Amazon would guarantee next day delivery, wow! I was thinking I would use Amazon for research and then buy one locally, even if I had to pay more money, but this was a dream unfolding, it it panned out as advertised. So I ordered the router at about 11:00 PM Sat night and, to my shock and amazement, it was delivered about 11:00 AM on Easter Sunday - WOW!","[]","B01GPAOJJG","B01GPAOJJG","AHFXSIDJDT7EYTFTMRDO3447CTFQ","2017-04-22 15:02:17.000","2","True","511"

I have MSI afterburner installed with it monitoring it constantly and it seems to do just fine with the slight boost to the core clock from that software. As others have said you may want to wait and opt for another card with custom cooling solutions but since my other card died last week, I needed something ASAP and since this one was the first one to restock I went with it since everywhere I read said the Founder's Editions are basically all the same anyway outside of the brand name on the packaging. Hopefully I will continue to have as good an experience out of this card and hopefully, the information I posted here will help someone else out when making their purchase.\\n\\nJust to toss this out there, I bought this card to run everything in 4k. I would prefer to run everything in 4k at max settings but I know that won't likely be the case always so I bought this card based off reviews saying it should be easily able to run 4k at good framerates.\\n\\nDoing another update now. Earlier today I tried it out in a populated area on World of Warcraft and it was dipping to the 20-30 fps range on the highest settings so even this card will likely have some issues putting out in high traffic or end game raiding in 4k Resolution. Also, if there's any other game that someone would like me to try out to let them know how it works feel free to post it in the reply and I will try to find a demo or benchmark to try out with it.","[]","B06XH2P8DD","B06Y1J7WCC","AHZR2HH2A7UHUBAHMLDYFRYR6CUA","2017-04-05 15:18:58.000","6","True","511"
"704524","3","""Meh""","Let me start this review by stating I've had 3 Kindles altogether, including this one. The first one was the very first Kindle and it was great for what it was at the time. If I remember correctly I paid almost $400 for it and it was the pinnacle of technology. I still have it but it's a tad bit outdated. The second was the 1st gen of the 10ish inch Fire. It was expensive, slow, the screen sucked and the charger port kept braking. It was pretty much the crappiest $200+ mistake. In the end, it went to PC Recycle.\\n\\nThat brings us to the current Paperwhite. I just purchased this a couple of weeks ago. I bought it while it was on sale for $20 off. I got it with special offers and 3G for $169.99, I also bought the 3 year protection plan ($19.99) after the nightmare that my Fire was and got 3 months of Kindle Unlimited for $1.99. The package was nice and the small extras for a good price were convenient.\\n\\nI've tested the Paperwhite in just about every environment possible. Light, dark, indoors, outdoors and it's just &#34;meh&#34;. The matte screen is very nice and I like to read it on about 10-15 brightness. It doesn't hurt your eyes and the upgrade to the higher resolution screen is great. The bookerly font that they tout as amazing and easy to read, looks like every other font and even with the upgrade of more LED lights, there's still a funny shadow at the bottom of the screen. Almost like stripes but barely there. It only bothers me when I read in the evenings or in a dark area. The battery life is mediocre and with a heavy amount of reading, lasts less than a week. The pages aren't as intuitive and smoothly turning as the Kindle app is on my phone. The 3G only connects part of the time and always wants me to connect to WiFi. I guess I expected more from such an expensive and simple device. I also paid the $20 to turn off the special offers. I bought a case that turns the Kindle on and off by closing the screen and it was a hassle to have to swipe also.\\n\\nAll in all, I wouldn't buy this device at this price again, I'd opt for Prime Day or when it goes on deep discount sale.","[]","B01BFIB1SA","B01BFIB1SA","AFBGSLOMQ7KBJXO5QDWMBKE5M32Q","2017-09-07 18:57:50.293","4","True","511"
"734895","1","Get a Roku!","I don't write many reviews despite the fact that Amazon delivers to my house more days of the week than not, I just can't be bothered. But my experience with the the Fire was so bad I felt it warranted one. I have never hated a device so much in my life. I have owned several Rokus over the years, and I was giving one of them to my son who was moving out so I thought I'd replace it with the Fire instead. It's awful in comparison...actually there is no comparison! The Fire had major problems loading shows, GoT in particular. It would keep buffering or something similar to that, it would also constantly tell my episodes weren't available, episodes I had paid for.  Then there were times it would just cut off and go black, that happened almost daily. There are also many times it will tell me it's having trouble loading Netflix. I think they are targeting Netflix because it almost never works with Netflix. But the Roku works just fine with Netflix.  It also had trouble with it recognizing purchases I had made, the episodes would show up in my library but then tell me to pay for them again. Even customer service couldn't figure that one out and ended up refunding me. Sometimes I would change the hdmi from the Fire to the Roku to see if the problem carried over, and guess what? At no point did I encounter the same issues with the Roku. I ended up calling customer service and they had me reboot, reset and clear my cache. Why? On a brand new system I had for a two weeks? Once again I have I will say I never had and still don't have any of these issues with the Roku. I've seen some people in discussion boards complaining about the same things and some suspect it may have something to do with they last software update. I have no idea if that's it,  but I will tell you I've gone back to my Roku and will never buy a Fire deivice again! And I'm a big fan of Amazon in general. I've been an early adopter of their products, had Prime back when nobody had heard of it. I have spent so much money here I've actually gotten hand written than you notes (hubby want happy about that at all). The reason I mention this is so you understand I'm not out to bash Amazon. But they really dropped the ball on this device, big time! Do yourself a favor and get a Roku, they're awesome.","[]","B00U3FPN4U","B00U3FPN4U","AHNBYZWB43T4R7E56U4XFO6QUT3Q","2017-10-17 20:13:32.361","1","True","511"
"26354","5","The best micro-USB cables I've found anywhere.","Okay, so in today's world, micro-USB cables seem to proliferate like rabbits around the house. Just about everything electronic seems to use them, and seems to come with one in its original packaging or box.\\n\\nAnd yet you're always short a cable. Many that come with devices wear out quickly—developing intermittent connections or being thin and brittle enough to develop shorts at either end. And many that are sold at stores for exorbitant amounts ($10-$12 for one three-foot cable?!) don't fare any better over the long term.\\n\\nAnd a good number of the cables out there are hobbled somehow. I don't know everything about the micro USB spec, but it's clear that some cables are data-only, some cables are charging-only, and some cables don't provide one or more connections necessary to charge all devices.\\n\\nIn short, it's a mess.\\n\\nI've now bought three batches of these cables because:\\n\\n- They are thick and well-built\\n- They last and last and last (connectors and wire portion)\\n- They do data successfully with every data device I have\\n- They successfully charge every device I have\\n\\nIn short, after I bought my first batch of these, I realized that whenever there was a hiccup doing data transfer or charging something, if I tracked down one of *these* cables, it would work no matter what. Soon I just didn't want to deal with all of the other cables, and now all of the cables that actually *came* with my devices are left filed away somewhere and unused. Like I said, I've bought three batches of these, which is enough for every device in the house to be either connected or charging all simultaneously without running out of cables, and it's bliss—no cable juggling, all identical, all the same length, all working great, and not a single one has failed so far.\\n\\nI used to think that the micro-USB spec was just terrible, but now I think that too many companies just cut corners or make crap cables. Anker doesn't, and their cables are very economical compared to most retail prices for micro-USB cables, too. If you're trapped in cable hell, I heartily recommend these as a cost-effective, no-fuss solution.","[]","B015MJLEUS","B0BMQL6DMR","AFICMXNXCSEUACT3XWHPDPLX3GJQ","2017-11-25 01:25:45.991","12","True","511"

I can't believe that a 320 dollar pair of headphones can't provide a full day worth of batery. 8 hours is not enough. They tell you to buy av20 dollar external battery that you need to charge inside the headphones so it's useless. The systems they say they provide to safe battery are simply BS.\\n\\n2: Sensors have wrong algorithms. The self turn of algorithm sucks. I study and work with these on. If you keep that system on every time you make the slightest movement inwards it turns off unexpectibly.\\n\\n3 POOR  quality on materials. I accept the fake leather as a vegan option, but since fake leather is cheap plastic they could have gone for one that does not wear out and peal off.\\n\\n4 Poor electronics.

But once and them the headphones freezes down and I need to unplug the battery and plug it back.\\n\\n5 Pads won't detach, they will wear down because of the cheappy crappy plastic they use and you can't replace them, y you need to buy  new headphones.\\n\\nSound is very good, design is nice, the concept is great, but crappy outcome, they cut corners and the end product is not what promissed. I moved to Sound and Dynamic hopefully they pay more attention to details.\\n\\nOne last detail  God forbade you need their customer service, they have a phone they say is customer service but their only policy is telling you NO even it's clearly their fault. My first pair had several issues I tried to fix it with them, they said no arrogantly and impolitely then I called Amazon and they said they covered it for me so I'm the en Parrot got my broken ones back to them.","[]","B016Y37MD4","B016Y37MD4","AH6SY4IIYO6WSN4BD2WGJLFNFNDQ","2017-06-24 18:53:51.654","0","False","511"

The quality of the camera is what I expected after having a 2012 Camry with a factory backup camera. Quality of the image at night does suffer as it did on my Camry so no big deal there. This is a lifesaver when in angled parking downtown or backing out of a drive.\\n\\nThe installation took us(Two Guys-1 experienced in equipment installs, 1 just a gofer) about an hour and twenty minutes. Most of the work is pulling door trim kick plates and taking the dash board apart.\\n\\nTools Needed-Socket Set(deep well & shallow well), Electrical Tape, Side Dikes, Wire(butt) Connectors, & Pull Cable or Homemade Pull Device\\nI didn't purchase the extra tools as we had the majority of the tools to pull the panels and dash. I did use the plastic tool sent with the kit and it did come in handy for the dash.\\n\\nInstallation-We followed the installation of the video pretty close. Mounting the camera in the center as suggested in the video worked great as there is a small area already marked for it between the tag lights. We did use the clips under the trunk lid to run the wire through instead of zip ties. Under the dash we used zip ties and snipped them back. We used a butt connector to wire the power(red cables) together. Electrical Taping both of the yellow video connectors to hopefully avoid any issues down the road with them disconnecting.\\nTips:\\n1.) Avalon's have a light that illuminates the storage area below below the stereo(in front of the shifter).This piece just pops off, do not try to remove the small looking clip as that is the light you'll have to unplug after you remove the trim piece.\\n2.) There is a spot to run your wire from the trunk through to the back seat. It appears to be a sealed trunk but has a 3&#34;-4&#34; rubber wire access seal to pull through.\\n3.) There is a leather piece(beauty cover) that is attached to the gauge trim, pop off the leather grommets and remove trim piece to the right.\\n\\nTake your time and watch the video before you begin and keep it handy while doing the install.

I would not trust this product to hold up the weight of my TV over an extended period after seeing how poorly their screws held up.\\n\\nLonger Version:\\nI purchased this TV wall mount based on the positive reviews and the affordable price.\\n\\nThis was a clear mistake.\\n\\nWhile the frame and overall &#34;pieces&#34; of the mount seemed well made and put together properly and sturdily, the screws that were included were HORRIBLE and CHEAP.  I had no issues with the screws and attachments putting the pieces on the back of the TV (a 36&#34; Phillips, older model), the issue arose when I attempted to screw the mount to the wall.\\n\\nI used a Ryobi power drill for this task, and first made pilot holes into the studs in the wall.  What should have been a simple process quickly became a nightmare.  The first screw went in properly, but the following one snapped half way in, causing the end to be stuck a good half inch into my wall with no easy way out.  Thinking it was a fluke, I used another pre-packaged screw in a different corner and it managed to strip itself while I was installing it.  While trying to remove it, that one also decided to snap off.\\n\\nAfter 2 bad screws, in a package that was meant to provide reliable supplies, I was no longer willing to trust the other screws with the task of holding my TV's weight.  Especially when they could barely hold up to the simple task of being drilled into a stud!  After around 3 other HDTV TV mount installs throughout my house over the years, with various TV mounts (of a much superior quality), I still can't believe I had the screws of all things give out on me.  Just because the pieces are of seemingly decent quality, does NOT mean the extra time and money was spent to ensure the connective pieces were up to the same standard.\\n\\nAfter being so excited to install this mount when I received it, its shocking that I have an even greater level of hatred now as I put it back in the box and ship it back on Monday.  If UPS wasn't closed on Sundays, it'd be gone first thing tomorrow morning!","[]","B015MXXDVW","B015MXXDVW","AFNH2XTPFU2OWC5J2243UZ27SIBA","2017-06-25 04:49:27.009","0","True","511"

Pricey at the time, I've NEVER regretted my purchase.

Both devices require a several minutes of setup and both require firmware updates out of the box.  The Roxio Game Capture HD PRO Customer service was piss poor, chat with their support team left me with more questions than answers and I received canned responses that were not in line with the question asked. A call to their toll free number was about as appalling.\\n\\nI have been able to use both items as a PVR and make you tube videos with the devices. Roxio Game Capture HD PRO has a bit of a advantage as it allows for LIVE streaming and uploading to youtube. Although Roxio Game Capture HD PRO has a cheaper price.  The HDML Evolve requires PC while the Evolve device will record independently with SD card or USB device.\\n\\n  Technical support and customer service was very informative, friendly and customer focused to accommodate the customer with the HDML-Evolve. I recorded shows directly from my Fire stick, and ROKU devices with both devices. I did have to purchase OREI HD-102 1x2 1 Port HDMI Powered Splitter Ver 1.3 Certified for Full HD 1080P & 3D Support (One Input To Two Outputs) in order to get the HDMI Security to send video to the recording device. Either device will function for PVR and video management.\\n\\nIn conclusion, after revisiting and testing both items thoroughly I would recommend the HDML-Cloner Box Evolve, Capture I would like to see additional firmware upgrades to allow for HDMI video/audio signal to pass thru without needing second device. Also uploading functions in PC software, maybe DLNA to smart tv's, etc. A plus of the Evolve was the Free USB device that was included in the packaging of the HDML-Cloner Box Evolve, Capture, I really liked both and because of the customer service, the great technical support, i have to reemphasize the prompt and curtious customer service with the HDML- Evolve. Should you experience any concerns,  Julia of Cloner Alliance Support Team would be a good point of contact.\\n\\nMy comments are based upon my actual beta testing of the units and asking questions of the mfg about setup, performance, and actually video editing with the devices mentioned above.

We all have this space where we throw our random crap because the reality of photography is controlled chaos.  I've always admired peak design products because they legitimately improve my workflow and help me manage the chaos of shooting.  Need a carrying system without tangling yourself up in straps?  Capture clip to the rescue!  Need a strap that is easy to adjust and remove depending on the situation?  Slide does the trick!  Changing lenses constantly in the field becoming a risky hassle?  Lens change kit is a god send!  Need to change the set-up of your gear to accomodate different shooting situations?  anchor links!....every....where.\\n\\nI also own peak designs everyday messenger and and recently added the everyday backpack and while these bags are very thoughtfully designed, they don't seem to give much consideration to the chaos of real world shooting.  It's as if the designers of these bags live in this utopian photography world where one can slow down neatly take place their random crap into these very specifically shaped pockets.  I LOL at the idea!  Perhaps we start by packing our bags this way, but when it comes to actually shooting, I find the whole concept sort of ridiculous.  What I really need more than special pockets is a space to quickly throw my crap!\\n\\nAnd so here enters the peak design field pouch....or as I call it, the field bag o'crap.  What this thing is to me is a very modular bag or crap that can accomodate the crap accumulated in different shooting situations.  In the middle of a shoot this thing is attached to my belt as a utility pouch (because that sounds cooler than fanny pack).  When shooting casually and packing light with my Sony Rx1RII and nissin i40, I attach it to my slide lite and wear it like a mini everyday carry bag (because that sounds cooler than man-purse).  When traveling I keep it in my everyday backpack or attach it to the outside of the bag using anchor links so I have a separate crap holder (because that sounds cooler than travel tote).\\n\\nLong story short, the field pouch is simply a great bag o'crap.

I've only used a small handful of other dacs before and this one sounded just as good if not better than most that I tried.\\n\\n  The audio inputs can be selected by pressing the volume control in as a button and will switch between usb,optical and coaxial and the front indicator light will change colors depending on the selection. The unit can be powered on/off by pressing the volume in for a few seconds. |\\n\\n I'm currently using this dac to drive a pair of Monoprice 8323 headsets. As many people probably already know, they are cheap but very capable cans and while they don't necessarily need a powerful amp/dac to drive them, they definitely benefit in overall sound quality by using one. In the near future, I will be testing a pair of Beyerdynamic DT770s with this dac and will update this review with how that sounds. The sound quality with my monoprice cans sounds clean and flat like most of the other dacs I tried. Very pleasant to listen to. The volume control is digital so there is no noticeable channel imbalance as opposed to some analog volume controls.\\n\\n My only real complaints with this products is that that rca output jacks on the back do not appear to work as regular low-gain outputs as you can control the volume of those outputs from the front of the dac. Using the dac at full volume with the rca outs seems to sound great though so it isn't being overly pre-amped it seems. The volume control does make a slight pop sound through the headphones when it steps up and down although it doesn't seem to do this through the rca outputs. The digital volume stepping may cause an issue with some people where one step down is just a little too quiet and one step up is a little too loud. Another thing worth mentioning as it may concern some people is that the device will output audio to the headphones and the rca output jacks at the same time. Hooking into the headphone jack will not cut audio to the rear outputs and as far as I know, that isn't normal.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uUI-CQDFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uUI-CQDFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uUI-CQDFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jlJZQVwwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jlJZQVwwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jlJZQVwwL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01EV3ZMHC","B01EV3ZMHC","AHDLB6FHBKBH2DHYUCM5Z5IPCE6Q","2017-03-02 06:46:02.000","1","False","511"
"995847","5","My Overall Review","The GGMM4 is a quality speaker with beautiful design. To start, the exterior is one for a center master piece, and with the M4 pairing option - a nice addition to the ambiance in the room. The battery lasts quite a while. I was reaching nine hours and thirty minutes on the highest volume. Also, with the included strap, I cas able to even bring this speaker to some of my picnickils! Continuing my review i found the bass to be superb though overall loudness to be truly lacking. I was disappointed. If you like deeper tones with clarity of sound but are not looking to blow out your ears or hold a get together with excessive noise, get this speaker.\\n\\nI reviewed it three stars for a few reasons.\\n1. It lacks in overall resonance which I value greatly.\\n2. I believe the price is a tad high for the experience noise wise, though the design more than makes up for it.\\n3. I had received the incorrect color the first time I ordered. GGM's customer service department did fix the issue and also exceeded themselves in rectifying the problem. Though the shipping time the first time, the return, and the second time were a significant inconvenience to me.\\n\\nTherefore, this is a quality speaker, great looks, amazing bass, with good customer service.\\n\\nEdit: After one year of ownership, the speaker has settled into itself. This speaker is not ment for podcasts or music of more classical backgrounds. Where this speaker excels is music by MrSuicideSheep or Chuki Beats, with the occasional beat heavy Bachata/Reggueton here and there. If you focus on playing these music genres, the speaker will not only preform better than when other music genres are played, but also noticeably louder (nudging [not shaking] my walls in my small bedroom and for a small/medium sized speaker this was impressive). This speaker has surprised me in many ways. In a last note, I give props to the battery - not too shabby never dying on me - though I never have it unplugged for more than 7-8 hours of playtime.\\n\\nMy previous review still stands. All that changed was my appreciation for the quality and joy ownership of GGMM4 has brought me as an Android user\\n\\nPs. Never figured out the Wi-Fi function, though still works great as Bluetooth.","[]","B00RWH6YF4","B00RWH6YF4","AG626SSL34SWL2DUHEP7LQLHZR7A","2017-01-22 22:32:15.000","2","True","511"
"739463","5","Excellent product, great quality and build, definitely makes reading more pleasurable, and much easier!","I'm not a big bookworm, I've only read a handful of books in my life, but it's something I wanted to get more into. A steady habit of reading before bed, as an alternative to staring at screens all day for work, then all night for entertainment. Funny enough though, instead of buying a hardcover book (which generally prefer), I decided to get a Kindle. My boss has the new Oasis, but after seeing the price tag, and the very minor upgrades, I decided on the paper white. It's the perfect happy medium, at only $99, it's a great price, and a great product. I started off reading books, but quickly got annoyed with the page flipping, and book holding, while laying on my back. My arm with start to go numb, and at night when my wife would doze off, I'd turn on the book like which was a whole other thing. I decided if I was going to keep this habit up, I should get myself into a happier mood and attitude about it. The paperwhite was perfect, got the version with ads, which were actually useful at times, but ended up contacting customer service to ask them to remove it. That's right, you can pay less for the kindle while you buy it by getting the version with ads, then either call or chat (which is what I did) with customer service, tell them you want to turn off ads, and they do it immediately from their end. The ads disappear, and instead I get various splash screen images.\\n\\nThe quality of the kindle is amazing, very comfortable, and quite light. If your looking for super-duper light, go for the Oasis, but be prepared to pay much more. Not work the extra few grams in my opinion. The lighting is more than adequate, during the night I only turn on the light to level 6, out of a possible 30 or 50 or something. And during the day, it's an absolute pleasure to read. I know I got into reading to not only read more, but to ditch my screen exposure, and I think even with the Kindle, this accomplishes that. Since purchasing this, I've already read 1 book, and I'm onto my second.\\n\\nIf your looking for a case (which everyone should), I would highly recommend a case I purchased here on Amazon. Check out my other reviewed items for the case—also very happy with my decision.","[]","B00OQVZDJM","B00OQVZDJM","AEJ2YFW2HKY4ULFK2NWNCK4BKXIA","2017-09-22 14:07:10.316","1","True","511"
"309703","4","Decent basic home all-in-one desktop","This is a decent enough home desktop for personal/family use. No, it won't be able to play many games, but it's a basic machine for web surfing/Office and other tasks. The form factor is nice, and it was easy to set up and get going. The out of the box experience is basic - Windows 10 will take its time configuring itself and get you up and ready. The keyboard and mouse are included and nothing special - but they're the solid Dell base peripherals. Overall the computer was responsible and not too sluggish. There's both wireless and a wired connection, so you're able to place this wherever suits you - and was easy to get set up. The display is pretty good - it's not totally amazing but after a few hours of watching movies and web browsing, I didn't feel any eye strain.\\n\\nAs for the ports: We've got two USB 2.0 ports and two USB 3.0 ports that are side mounted. It seems a bit odd to not have a USB 3.0 port on the rear - because presumably it'd be more elegant if you had an external drive that you'd keep permanently attached and not have to deal with slower speeds of USB 2.0. There is a HDMI out, a DVD drive (download VLC to watch movies to avoid paying for the DVD playback codec) and a 4 in 1 card reader, so you can connect SD cards from your digital camera.\\n\\nAs for the processor: it's basic and light use. Benchmarks put this as slower as an Intel Core i3 5005U but not by much. I think the bottleneck is the slower hard drive. The 6gb of RAM seems sufficient as long as you're not pushing intensive applications.\\n\\nFor those brave souls, it is possible to replace the internal hard drive with a SSD and do a clean install of Windows using the Windows 10 Media Creation tool, but it will require a decent amount of work to get right. The computer is only upgradeable to 8gb of RAM.\\n\\nI hate to say this - but this is a desktop that's made for people over 60 or those with extreme basic needs in a desktop computer. The price is right (~$500) and my mom loves it for basic things. It's a decent enough desktop, but it's important to set the expectations that it won't be a lightning-fast desktop.\\n\\n3.5 stars","[]","B071DVKVKZ","B071DVKVKZ","AEMQYBTZ4X6JE2X4XBUK5CB2UH2A","2017-06-06 12:57:27.000","9","False","511"
"490832","3","Disappointing -- Amazon you can do better.","As a tablet, the new Fire HD 10 seems to have decent enough performance. I have had my HDX 9 for a while and wanted a larger tablet since I've pretty much abandoned using my laptop. Good grahics, fast enough response (I don't play any games so that's not an issue), plenty of storage space for my music (most of it is in the cloud anyway), and so on. So why only a 3 star rating?\\n1. The speakers are horrible. I am a musician and music lover. I didn't expect Bose-like surround sound, but I expected more than this. My old Kindle is vastly superior.\\n2. What must be the cheapest, lowest range wifi they possibly could have included. Really Amazon? I'm in my bedroom right now. A Cisco powerline extender is right outside my closed door (note: I live overseas and my home is all concrete, so wifi coverage in a house is always an issue. However, I finally succeeded in getting a good signal everywhere in my house, or so I though...). The Roku that is ten feet away from me right now is getting a good signal. My old Kindle, which is next to me on the dresser, is getting a good signal. In fact, my set up actually gives three wifi options in the house, depending on where you are (the main router and two different extenders). From where I am right now, the other devices in this room can connect to any of the three with at least three bars. Not so for this new HD10. At present, and as always, I am getting zero bars on any of them. That's why I'm using my phone as a hotspot right now -- just so I can connect to Amazon and write this review. Yes, Amazon, the wifi connector is so weak that I have to use the phone WHICH IS LITERALLY RIGHT NEXT TO ME for a signal instead of 3 router options that are available for everything else.\\n3. Unreliable Bluetooth connectivity. At first I thought it might be the keyboard, but this is my 2nd one and it also randomly disconnects in the middle of me typing. Given the cheapness of the other two main components, I'm sorry Amazon, but you don't get a pass.\\n\\nThat sums it up. This is the 11th -- yes 11th -- Kindle I have purchased. For the first time, I am truly disappointed.","[]","B01NGTRMNR","B01MTF2Z37","AF2TPEJDQIT3XPCHLYPHJ4X5YT4Q","2017-12-26 10:10:41.499","1","True","511"

If you can keep that in mind for what you are paying for you will enjoy this receiver.\\n\\nPro's\\n-very good picture quality. You can use your remote to turn off the both tv/receiver.  Also, you can change tv inputs on the tv through the receiver. IE: Bluray player, etc.\\n\\n-although only 80 watts per channel, can handle a Klipsch Icon setup/satellite speakers (bookshelf, center) with ease.\\n\\n-Very intuitive to use.  Easy setup to your media files on your computer with the use of it's Music Server.\\n\\n-Very good app called iControlAV5.  Finger EQ, Balance and manual dialogue control are a plus.  Status view is a needed function as you can individually control each channel to your liking.\\n\\nCon's\\n-No HD radio capabilities.  Then again, what receiver at this price range actually does yet?\\n-Limited MCACC capabilities.  This should be something they should consider in an update for this unit.  Unless, you really know what you are doing the manual setup of MCACC is pretty much useless be it manual or automatic settings.\\n-Automatic settings of MCACC only lowers the sound quality.  It  just doesn't work like it should for this unit.\\n-No separate manual LFE control, I mean come on man, come on!!!\\n\\nCaveats\\n-Finger EQ required to get that added volume.  I was amazed how much louder the speakers got once I started tweaking Finger EQ settings.  It sounds so much better now.  But it requires you to enable iControlAV5 every time you turn the receiver on.  I wish there was a way for the receiver to remember these settings.  Would be nice to see in a update -hint -hint...\\n-Although iControlAV5 is the best app out there I found the apple version far more intuitive to the android version.\\n\\nSo with that all said why did I still give it 5 stars?  Because it's actually an excellent entry Elite receiver (albeit I got it for a good price on black friday).","[]","B01DMW90SA","B01DMW90SA","AG2S7RW4QC623T4A36QV63KJCGWQ","2017-01-05 02:06:53.000","4","False","511"
"477663","5","No longer need to ""Tap""","As of February 2017 you can enable the Tap to work handsfree - just like an Echo.  Currently the only downside to this is the only wake word available is &#34;Alexa&#34; - The Echo and Echo Dots have choices for wake words.  This is a problem when you have every other Echo set to be &#34;computer&#34; and the Taps have to be &#34;Alexa&#34;.  Otherwise I haven't noticed much of a difference between the Tap and Echo as far as responsiveness and understanding of what is being asked - hands free.\\n\\nThis also leads to the very useful capability of connecting bluetooth without physical interaction.  Just ask &#34;Alexa - connect to &#60;Name's&#62; iPhone&#34; and it will connect up.  To disconnect just ask Alexa to disconnect bluetooth.  Extremely easy for pairing and un-pairing.  The one nit that has hung around - is one cannot use the TAP as a Bluetooth speakerphone.  Everything as far as hardware goes - is there for it - but it doesn't have the profile.  I still give the TAP 5 stars as this is my desire - but the TAP never was marketed as a speakerphone.\\n\\nI have tested the Tap while traveling and it connects up to hotel wifi just fine.  Usually you have to use the Alexa app to sign into the hotel wifi but once that is done everything seems to stream like normal.  This is at major chains like Hilton and Hyatt, as well as some boutique hotels and condos.  I have done it enough to be confident that it should work for most hotel wifi - but I am sure there are corner cases where it may not work.  That being said - with the bluetooth being so easy to connect now - it may be better just to use it as a speaker for your phone when traveling.\\n\\nLastly - vs the Echo Dot.  The Dot is cheaper - but you need to bring your own bluetooth speaker to work with the Dot.  If you have a good Bluetooth speaker (which a lot of people do) then the Dot may be the way to go.  If you have to buy a speaker on top of the Dot - then with the hands free enabled I'd say you'd be hard pressed to pass up the Tap especially when they go on sale.","[]","B01BH83OOM","B01BH83OOM","AEXERLHM5LKUBKUPKFGI6AK6J6JQ","2017-03-06 04:49:37.000","1","True","511"

That experience was more than a decade ago though, so I decided to give HP another chance.\\n\\nShort version: HP still sucks at QC and at repair speed.\\n\\nBrand new out of the box this laptop had a defective sound board.  The sound was scratchy and had dropouts, and sometimes random sounds would emerge when no sound was being played.  The sound board failed the BIOS diagnostics.\\n\\nThis problem should have been readily apparent if any quality control check was made at the factory (like, run the BIOS diagnostics).\\n\\nA google search turned up similar audio problems with other HP laptops with the B&O sound.\\n\\nSince this was the only laptop available with the features I wanted, and since Amazon was out of stock on a replacement, I submitted a service ticket with HP.\\n\\nThe &#34;next day onsite&#34; repair took two weeks because they had to order the part.  I couldn't really use the laptop in that time, because the first thing I needed to do to use the laptop was install Linux, and I didn't want to repartition and customize a laptop that I might have to return as defective.\\n\\nReplacing the sound board fixed the scratches and dropouts, and mostly fixed the random noises  The service tech was professional and efficient and also apologetic for the poor factory QC and the delay in service.\\n\\nI'm happy with the laptop since then.  There are some quibbles, like the low-quality feel of the trackpad buttons, but I knew about those things from reviews before I bought it.  I'm just happy to have buttons at all - I lived with the similar Dell Precision for a while before this and the awful clicky-pad drove me nuts.\\n\\nWhile waiting for the repair, I found that there were a couple of new laptops just coming on the market that met my specs.\\n\\nIf I was doing it all over again, I'd get one of those others instead.","[]","B01AS8T13K","B01AS8T13K","AEQ5VAWWA5YRC7YZRI57UGS5M5HA","2017-03-27 03:46:01.000","0","True","511"

So, I bought a cable for the monitor and hooked it up. Got the anniversary win 10 update and all the programs updated and have been able to let my laptop have some rest. I get in bed and watch something on the monitor until I fall asleep. The monitor goes to sleep eventually, too.

"765062","4","Excellent budget softbox","This is my first softbox, so I do not have much to compare this to.  I do have a set of umbrellas that I use, but this lets me have a bit more control over where the light is being thrown.  The diffuser adds a wonderful soft light that does some incredible things with skin tones.\\n\\nSet up is pretty straight forward and it opens up just like an umbrella.  There is a zippered opening to get your stand through the bottom and then mount the flash on the inside.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Easy set up and take down, although there it is a bit of trick to fold the diffuser panel correctly to get it back into the carry bag with the softbox. I’m sure once you do it a few times, it will not be an issue.\\n- Size – this thing is really large (over 4 feet diameter!) once you get it set up and you can direct a nice wall of light with this thing.\\n- Diffuser makes a wonderful soft light.\\n- Seems like it is well constructed for the price.  I am not sure if it would survive a tumble in the wind, but I plan on mostly using this indoors.\\n- Provides good lighting with both a speedlight and plug-in strobe.\\n\\nCons:\\n- The flash unit goes inside the umbrella. If you have a manual flash, adjustments are best dialed in before you Velcro on the diffuser panel.  Having it on the inside really can’t be avoided with this style of softbox, but it’s something to be aware of before buying.\\n- There is no articulating arm on the mount, so you will not be able to angle this unit.  Your only option is straight up and down.  Because it is so large, it hasn’t been a problem for me.  One other reviewer suggested mounting it on a boom stand, which would be a pretty easy solution to adjust the angle.\\n\\nOverall, I am very happy with this softbox and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an affordable, yet quality entry to expand their flash photography gear.  I have had a good experience with the Neewer brand so far.  I have this softbox paired with the Neewer 250W Studio Flash and I have been very happy with the results.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Ci+xS2JjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Ci+xS2JjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Ci+xS2JjL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UvQ23qMDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UvQ23qMDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UvQ23qMDL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00PIM3I7W","B07TS5SMLD","AEITNII2MOAUW4YIJQEULQ7LMLPA","2017-03-14 15:02:31.000","29","True","511"

Enclosing the AA within it means the positive &#34;button end&#34; projection from the battery cannot make contact with with anything where the device's contact is recessed. Worst of all, this was the case for the what I intender to use them for AND for many other things. A folded/balled up piece of tin foil set between the contacts solved the issue, but it was far from ideal.\\n\\nLong story: I have to remind myself that these were just under four bucks for eight to keep my judgment in perspective.\\nQuality wise, they are far from the flagship of high quality battery adapters made by Eneloop, but those are far more expensive. Still, if you want the best and willing to &#34;buy once, cry once&#34;, get the Eneloops because you'll never have to buy them again.\\n\\n  Now, these generic adapters the review focuses on? Well, each will hold 2 AA batteries to increase their capacity closer to that of an actual D cell, rather than holding only one like the Eneloops and others do. I've also tried these out and they worked flawlessly. So far this earns them a 5* review. However, the hinge that closes is suspect and I fully expect it will fail through cycles each time the plastic nonmechanical hinge is flexed. So, this has me  me already thinking of ways I'll likely need to tape them shut when, &#34;oops, I knew this was inevitable!&#34;, finally occurs and it breaks off.\\n  If you need these quickly, forget it. The miniscule price included free shipping, but it took a month to arrive on the slow boat from China. Buy these with that in mind.\\n  Would I buy again? Sure. They're so inexpensive it's ridiculous, and even if and when the hinge does fail, I'd still buy again.So, if you've got anything that runs on D batteries, have access to the far more common AA type and don't need it &#34;yesterday&#34;, throw these in your cart right now.\\nFYI, I also ordered an 8 pack of AA to C adapters at the same time for about four and change.

The product description lists &#34;PLAY ON, the internal battery provides up to 15 hours of uninterrupted playback and talk time.&#34; I fully charged the device before I left for my trip (I waited until the charging LED turned green before disconnecting the power), and used the AirMod in the following manner: 98% listening to music/podcasts, 2% phone call. **My total travel time was about 7 hours, of which, I received 5.5 hours of actual playback via the AirMod.**\\n2. I made only two phone calls (to the same recipient, but on different days), and both times the individual had difficulty hearing me in a partially noisy environment. On the other hand, when using the Bose's default wire with in-line microphone, the individual had little to no difficulty in hearing me.\\n3. Proprietary charge cable, although this is somewhat understandable as no micro-USB charger slot is needed on the device itself in order for the manufacturer to save space.\\n4. Difficult to confirm the AirMod device turns off when the headphones are turned off.\\n\\nPerhaps I received a defective unit or one with an unusually poor battery, but 5.5 hours is a bit low. I anticipate two things could have happened: the AirMod adapter takes a significant amount of time to turn off/stop broadcasting, even though the Bose headphones' switch is turned off OR I actually received a defective unit.\\n\\nIf the stated battery life is &#34;up to 15 hours,&#34; I would have expected about 10 hours in real life testing.

(kind of like a black and white screen kindle, or a calculator, you get the idea.. and actually the thickness of the bezel bothers me more than the monochrome screen) and although it has the features i want (and most people want) most like providing you your notifications and texts and email on your wrist, it doesn't have all the little extras that other brands have.\\nin fact i had to give it 4 stars because in the time ive had this ive moved to a different watch for my primary use, the thing i found most disappointing was that at the time i had a windows phone and this was advertised as working with windows phone and the app just, didn't work, plain and simple.\\nbut it worked great with my google pixel and an iPhone i tried for a short while\\n\\nBig Pro.. even though i don't think ive touched it in a month or two.. its just been sitting, turned On, on my desk, and the battery has 76% left..\\nother watches deal in hours and days.. this one lasts weeks, or months.. like, long enough that the only charging problem you are likely to have is that you need to make sure you remember where you put your charger the last time you charged the watch.. in fact i now primarily use a moto 360 gen2.. but i keep this around for days when i forget to charge the moto, i can grab this and put it on and it will still have plenty of battery even though ive neglected to charge it for weeks on end.\\n\\nthis is a watch for minimalists.. if you want your notifications on your wrist but don't care enough about other features, or more likely, don't want to be bothered by needing to charge yet another device every day.. then you should consider this\\n\\nthe truth is if my company weren't cool enough to pay for a new wearable device every year, i would have been happy to keep wearing this watch on a daily basis, having more feature filled devices available to me is the only reason i treat this like a backup device.\\n\\nIn the picture the Vector is Right and the Moto 360 gen 2 is left\\n(the vector has a code at the top of its screen because its not paired to my phone currently)","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cTG0Q7SaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cTG0Q7SaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cTG0Q7SaL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B0169MX34M","B0169MX34M","AHIIGBV6T44NQYXKJHHNPNTBEDVQ","2017-08-12 20:37:31.489","1","True","511"
"980182","4","Great camera for the price!!","After much consideration and research, I purchased this camera for surveillance purposes in my home.  It is being used indoors so I wasn’t concerned about durability as much as I was concerned about video quality, recording abilities, and its ability to promptly alert my mobile phone when necessary.  Since I currently rent my home, I also needed something easy to mount and remove while leaving behind minimal damage.  At this price and with free Prime shipping, this camera seemed to be the best fit for my needs.\\n\\nWhen I received the product and opened it, I was initially impressed with the design and size of the camera.  I thought it might be a little bulky but it ended up being the perfect size to mount under my removable shelf (with no damage!).  It came with everything I needed to mount it and I didn’t even need any extra tools beyond my small tool kit.  After I mounted it, I downloaded the app on my iPhone (as outlined in the instructions) and the app lead me through the quick and easy setup.  On the app, I managed all of my preferences and alert settings.\\n\\nThe video quality was satisfactory at 1080p; when people were in the frame, it was easy to distinguish who it was and what they were doing.  I did notice that the camera would pick up on very small movements (reflections from cars driving by, shadows, etc.) and alert me often.  It would be nice to be able to avoid that or have an option available to prevent being alerted of such small things.  However, the sensitivity of this camera may pay off someday.  I would definitely recommend buying a memory card for this camera (just a simple SD card with however much memory you prefer).  If you don’t put an SD card in it, it only records the first couple seconds of motion detection (i.e. when someone first enters the room).\\n\\nOverall, this camera gets the job done.  It is perfect for someone who is just trying to keep an eye on their valuables while they’re not home or, like my case, to make sure roommates don’t get into your things if you aren’t home a lot.  It rotates around enough to cover an entire room and the video quality is superb for the price.  With it’s easy setup, it is perfect for a beginner (or anybody for that matter).","[]","B01CW4BG4K","B01CW4BG4K","AHHXX4XF75BOI5WHYP7DFCYVWPYQ","2017-07-08 00:27:59.253","1","True","511"
"224512","4","Boutique price deserves boutique quality","On one hand, there's not really anything else out there that'll raise an iMac between 1 and 3 inches in small graduated steps. Most other generic stands either lock in at 2, or start at 3 inches, or something else that wouldn't work for me because I only needed an inch more height.. The only other choices here are essentially copies of this one.\\n\\nAnd I do have to say, while it's a bit...industrial, as a dude with an office that decidedly does not look like an Apple commercial, it's fine. The stash compartment is nice for whatever you might want to put in there, and the metal matches finish exactly with the iMac. The sizing is right on, and at the lowest shelf level the chin of the iMac just barely clears in a most pleasing way.\\n\\nMy only real beef is that it's not up to the standards of the machine sitting in it. The machining quality is kind of crappy on the edges, and in particular I have a burr on the leading edge that shines a little differently than the rest so it's noticeable. And the magnets aren't all the same depth so the front panel sits a little cockeyed, which is a bummer because if it sat straight it'd hide the burr. The plastic edging around the slot in back isn't straight on one side. I don't see that part so I don't care much, but it's still a little sloppy. At least this one I could put together--I tried buying one a couple of years ago, and it literally wouldn't fit it was mis-machined so badly. The two halves were different widths (and yes, sold by Amazon, etc., not counterfeit).\\n\\nMistakes happen for sure, but the machining quality is consistent with other hit-or-miss reviews. Plus that's two for two with flaws of some noticeable degree. When you're paying $70-80 for a block of aluminum that others are starting to charge $50 for, you really kind of want the quality to be more or less perfect. For $50 and a no-name, burrs might be OK, but for $70 and Twelve South, well, that's quality slipping right there.\\n\\nI wish I could give it four and a half stars. It really does serve a useful purpose and it's well-thought-out. It just needs a touch better execution.","[]","B009HPGD2I","B009HPGD2I","AGE4XWNFW2OOVZY343RHKJTH2DBA","2017-07-07 04:39:27.065","2","True","511"

Not extremely pricy and it had just enough information from all the reviews to help me make my choice ! Ordered the 5800 Friday and of course I am extremely impatient and did the one day delivery ! I was cleaning my wife's vehicle when the fed ex driver arrived yesterday and just the fun of watching him try to back into our driveway was worth the ten minutes awaiting him to unload the box ! It was hilarious to see him trying to back his truck! Anyway he brought this large box in for us and I began unpacking this nice system! Took longer to prepare the speaker wire I purchased than to set this system up! High quality looking product , set up was a breeze ! My son as I am typing this is watching Avengers age of ultron and the sound is absolutely amazing! The powered subwoofer is pumping amazing lows and it is just a great sounding system!\\n\\nI had an Onkyo years ago I bought from Best Buy that gave up the ghost several years ago ! I am ashamed to admit I had bought a cheap Sony system from Walmart that was supposed to be 1000 watts but it was decent but not exactly what I envisioned a sound system to sound like! I missed the onkyo sound and for only a couple hundred more than this Walmart Sony I upped my sound immensely !\\n\\nI have my DIRECTV , Xbox one, currently attached and the onkyo remote controls them all after a very short programming !\\n\\nI have yet to do enough research because I've only had it one day, but would love a detailed list of every sound setting and which time it's best used! I already have some favorites just from trial and error by pressing the display button to see what audio the movie/show is sending out and changing my listening choice appropriately ..\\n\\nAlready impressed with this system and I know I will delve more into each and every setting and see what each gives !\\n\\nGreat system absolute 5 star choice for me !\\n\\nPS: Thor just slammed his hammer into the ground toward end of this movie and it felt like entire house was part of the action! Zero exaggeration it was that powerful! And the volume is only on 18!!!!

"392839","5","Perfect for Macbook Pro 2016","Amazing! Works perfectly with Macbook Pro 2016 with a SINGLE USB-C cable to supply both video in full native resolution @ 75hz and get's charged via the monitor. I returned the LG Ultrafine 5k for this monitor and very glad I did, as it's 10x better.\\n\\nComing from the LG Ultrafine 5k, this is far superior for office/general/productivity. The Macbook Pro 2016 can't handle the 5k monitor without the dGPU's fan constantly revving up on a little 720p video, which really got on my nerves. However with this Acer at full resolution, my macbook is quiet is a mouse, even with a full screen video playing for several minutes.\\n\\nPRO:\\n-Size is shockingly good, but it took ~3 hours to get used to. My neck was hurting until I put the monitor back about 2 feet and keep my main window in the center third. BetterSnapTool or other window management software is a must.\\n-Text and DPI are excellent. I was nervous about leaving Retina DPI as I like crisp text (coding, slack, excel, atom, contracts, reports).\\n-Whites are excellent and matte AG isn't overly aggressive or grainy.\\n-USB-C functionality is perfect for Macbook Pro 2016\\n-Brightness is excellent. Mines at 70/100 and I like very bright and very white whites.\\n-Bottom LED lights are pretty cool, easy to change or turn off.\\n-Very comparable or BETTER than the LG 38uc99 in every way. Pretty much identical except for aesthetics\\n-Bezel and the back are sleek, look high quality and are thin and less noticeable than the LG 38 and especially compared to the LG Ultrafine\\n-Generates very little heat or isn't noticeable at all\\n-Zero wobble with this stand, it's extremely sturdy\\n\\nCONS:\\n-Far more backlight bleed than the LG Ultrafine, but it's only noticeable on a screensaver or on boot up.\\n-Less saturated colors (red/blue/green) compared to LG, possibly due to matte vs. glossy screen. The flatter colors are easier on the eyes surprisingly, especially for office and productivity work.\\n-Only way to adjust volume takes 2 clicks after programming the shortcut","[]","B01N6S1P2D","B01N6S1P2D","AGCFW56Z7BDX5QB7KZZIHQWYAKZA","2017-03-01 13:30:38.000","46","True","511"
"474468","3","A Decent Option at the Right Price Point","I bought this monitor during a sale in July, when the price was dropped to just $99.99.  At that price it represents a very good value, but at the $140+ price point it currently holds I would look elsewhere.\\n\\nFor starters, this was purchased solely as a secondary monitor for my home PC setup; the primary &#34;monitor&#34; is actually a 45&#34; Samsung HD-TV.  While this provides for a huge viewing area and crisp, clean graphics when gaming or streaming, it's not very useful during the odd times when I actually want to watch television *and* putter around on the internet...hence the smaller Lenovo at a price I couldn't beat.  In that role, where it's only used for a few hours at a time and only a couple of times per week on average, this 23-inch display is just fine: the colors are obviously not nearly as vivid as on the larger Samsung, and the lack of a remote is something of a downer, but I can see everything just fine and it works for what I need it for.  As a primary monitor I would not recommend it, but a fair part of that stems from being a middle-aged guy whose eyes aren't quite as sharp as they used to be.\\n\\nOne issue I have noticed is that this monitor puts out quite a bit more heat than I would expect from the smaller screen.  Not enough to make it unusable, but enough that I absolutely can feel the difference in the room, even given that the Lenovo sits 3-4 feet away from where I'm normally seated.  The included stand feels fairly flimsy, but should work just fine so long as you're not often knocking around the area where it sits.  From a purely functional basis, I've had no issues with it over the last 5 months of intermittent use--everything has worked beautifully from day one through now.  I can't really comment on the advertised response time as what gaming I do is not graphically intense enough to tax any monitor; video playback has been smooth and clean.\\n\\nTo sum up, if you can find this unit closer to $100 than to $150, it's worth picking up as a tertiary monitor, or perhaps as a primary in more of a traditional (home) office setup.  At $140+, though, I can't imagine there aren't better options out there.","[]","B01FXDVZ5W","B01IS6YPKI","AHMZWRNLY47POFLO3HOO3DWI5X2Q","2017-11-03 23:54:18.443","1","True","511"

An absolutelt stunning tablet, and without a shadow of a doubt gives the ipad pro a run for its money. I just paid 800 for an ipad pro and this was 299 are you kidding me. First thing my wife asked can we return the ipads no joking around.\\nThe tablet is fast and snappy. Side by side the screen is much better then the ipad screen, dont believe me? Go see for yourself.\\nMuch more vivid and life like.\\n\\nCons...OS is highly customized and a little annoying at times...so many customizations and a lot of apps you will never use. I think Samsung has more bloatware but still why oh why cant we keep stuff simple. Simple is nice and clean. We want performance not a boat load of apps that we will never even open...i am speaking for myself here.\\nBattery Life is far from acceptable...as i type this it has gone from 85 to 72 percent and before you say anything i checked everything possible to safe juice and i turned the screen brightness down also closed open apps etc.\\nLastly and this might cause me to send it back if this continues...wifi drops connection eventhough it shows great signal strength. Three times in 24 hours i have had to turn wifi off and back on again...i have checked all the settings including the settings that disconnect the network when the tablet is sleeping. Also checked date and time etc. We have great equipment and internet and our ipads do not have wifi trouble in fact the opposite they are flawless in that aspect. If this keeps up i will have to exchange it. All in all an amazing tablet. Someone needs to come out with a descent case for it. All the cases i have seen are junk. Currently usingnan old leather brookstone case that i modified from my last ipad. Anyway i can provide more information as i go but i love this tablet and hope i sort out the wifi trouble.\\nSo a quick update...5 minutes after i wrote this review the tablet literally shut all the way down and it took me a couple of minutes to get it restarted what was that?

I'm not a shill reviewer, I did not receive this as a review piece, and I actually use it with a Macbook Pro 13&#34; (2017).\\n\\nI have done a lot of research on these dongles/hubs. It seems that there are a few distinct &#34;shapes&#34; that perform the same. This one has a tapered &#34;folded taco&#34; look to it that have had good reviews on sites that I trust. The others are hit and miss, so I went with the cheapest &#34;taco&#34; I could find as I'm sure they are all made the same. Other &#34;taco&#34; brands were the [[ASIN:B01N0J5LSY Juiced Systems BizHUB USB-C Multiport Gigabit HDMI Hub - 3x USB 3.0 Ports - Gigabit Ethernet - HDMI 4K - SD/Micro SD - USB-C Power Delivery]] that LTT praised on their review. Those are $80, so I picked a cheaper &#34;taco&#34; truck to eat at.\\n\\nPROS:\\n-  All functions work. I was able to use all of the ports and they all worked as they should. NIC was fast, USB 3 transferred quick, and HDMI worked*\\n-  Matches Space Gray almost perfectly\\n-  Comes with a nice carrying pouch\\n-  No drivers needed. Just plug in and it goes. I think I did have to verify the resolution output of the HDMI was correct for my 1080P monitor, but that was all.\\n\\nCONS:\\n-  Still relatively expensive. Apple passed the cost of ports to us! Yay!\\n-  HMDI port will disconnect if the dongle is moved while in use. I emailed the seller and they said &#34;Thanks, we will improve&#34;. No offer to refund or replace. I didn't want to pay to ship it off, so I am living with their design/manufacturing flaw.\\n-  Connection cable is pretty stiff, so I hope it will handle bending over the usage life before I have to replace it.","[]","B073Z6XKYN","B073Z6XKYN","AEQP66VT5UWI5IUE3TBNCOE7ZUUQ","2017-12-19 16:46:32.837","2","True","511"

"422508","5","Nice design overall, better for new computer not old.","I purchased this for my older but still going strong laptop but was met with a few problems the main being that it seemed like it was throttling my laptop's CPU which is the biggest and the included software which I liked because of the display and ease of use would be at a constant 5-25% of CPU use, you can use it without the software if you want but I figured I'd try it also it comes in slow mode I wasn't getting high speeds until I added the software though the speeds weren't much better so I had to manual adjust it from the computers networking area which too a day or 3 to figure out switching back and forth between different modes I couldn't figure out how to get it to enter AC mode so I left it in N mode so it would at least be fast of course I did accidentally get it stuck in G more which I had to fix I finally figured out how to get it into AC mode and was getting nice speeds of 30-50 or so Mbps because of the 2.4 so it took me a good while to figure out how to get it to enter 5ghz mode as well as I eventually did and was able to top out at 100-120mbps although sadly it didn't stay that way and was constantly switching on me and the speed would randomly go down do I was forced to leave it in 2.4ghz which was fine considering my computer could only max out at 20mbps although all the throttling and uninstalling reinstalling the software made me decide it wasn't for me and that this device would probably work a lot better on newer computers rather than older so I decided to return it. Other side notes the installation pamphlet and disc came in Korean if I remember correctly but that wasn't that important because you can easily understand the pictures and installation CD even if it's in a different language and or download it from their websjye. Another side side note is in the networking where you change the modes and stuff on my computer was  Japanese and one in Chinese I believe which also wasn't a problem because if you've read all of the recent stuff you'll know that I was able to figure it out through trial and error over the course of like 3 days or so because I wasn't keen on wanting to mess with it at that moment. Overall I like the design and I think it'd work better on a newer computer than an older one so that's something to take into consideration if you've made it this far in it read the headline.","[]","B00K11UIV4","B00K11UIV4","AGKLKWB4FB2BZX6SMOFXXL5F2KAQ","2017-01-09 05:17:18.000","1","True","511"
"831503","5","Awesome and top notch TV from Sony!!","Wanted to upgrade my current tv and so started to look for a good tv with all latest feature but still need to be within budget. As always THERE were so many brands and so choices which really made it difficult to pick a best one for our needs. Then there were also a lot of customer reviews that had mixed opinions on each model which made it even more difficult to pick one. I would have at least visited my local stores 5 or 6 times to view the Tv's and had numerous discussions with each sales person at different stores.\\nFinally we had to pick one and so decided to get this TV which was our number one amongst the shortlisted. The idea was to give it a try and if we don't like it then return it. To be honest I am mind blown by this TV. Sony comes always on top when it has to do with 4K TV's. It was very easy to set it up and picture quality is top notch. The pictures are very natural and very realistic and that's were sony succeeds from other models like Samsung, LG etc where they produce high contrast pictures and these certainly comes down to ones preference. So we prefer more realistic and natural pictures as against high contrast bright pictures and that was one of the primary reason to have sony TV as number one in our short list. Next the thing that really confused us before buying this TV was all the consumer reviews that had some negative opinion about the remote control and the android platform. Due to this we had Samsung 8/9 series as second option and were even inclined to go for one of those set due to so many negative reviews on sony t.v. remote and Android platform. However after I turned on this TV within 10 mins made us feel there cannot be any better easy navigation and ease of control provided through the sony remote and Android tv. Trust me it was a breeze handling and VR added to the remote work flawlessly and simply superb. On top of all those you can also download android TV remote on your android phone and just control anything very easily. We generally watch the tv in a bright room and TV performs so very well producing great images and pictures. We are really glad that we purchased this TV set. If you are looking for a good 4K full HDR TV within budget then this will be a great buy and I am sure you will never be disappointed. By the way we had to buy from our local store and not from Amazon as Amazon delivery and timing was something that did not match our preference.","[]","B01MUG21R7","B01MUG21R7","AELXDTW3MPZ6UZCHVEABNXDYTCUA","2017-11-25 17:03:44.682","1","False","511"
"469819","5","A clear-cut BT winner for convenience/SQ at an amazing price point.","I own a slew of headphones (and have owned dozens all told) and for $45, these phones are tough to beat. No, they are not audiophile-quality sound, but with a bit of EQing, they can be made to behave. I find the treble a bit plasticky, for lack of a better term, but what's most amazing is the convenience for being out and about. Just clasp them around your neck with the magnets, no case, no hassle. And the combination of convenience with decent SQ is a winner.\\n\\nThis doesn't mean I will be chucking my $400 custom phones any time soon, or even dump my pair of Westone W20s with custom tips either. Both are great on the go options. But for working out, or walking the dog etc., these phones really are fantastic.\\n\\nOnly caveats so far is battery life (haven't tested it completely yet) and durability. If they last, both in terms of recharges required and long-term viability, then you can't really go wrong. Jury is out on that aspect of the BE2s but otherwise, a great cheap addition to any collection. And the tips that come installed, the bi-flanges, work perfectly for me too, very comfy. Overall, the design is the best I've had in terms of BT phones (I only tried a few). Much preferred to on-ear phones for BT, which I own as well (Monster iSport Freedoms, which I got as a replacement for the old Miles Davis Trumpet phones).\\n\\nUpdate:\\nSo I have been using the BE2s for about week and with some EQ tweaking, they have improved. Not sure I believe in burn in, but for whatever reason (maybe my EQ skills) the treble is smoothed out and now they really are a fun listen. Audiophile? No. But nothing offensive about their SQ either, guess you can say they are V-shaped and consumer-focused, but not in a negative way at all.\\n\\nIn terms of fit, I dumped the bi-flanges for the single tips, and since my right ear canal is a bit smaller I use a small on the right and medium on the left. Perfect comfort, and the controls are so easy to use.\\n\\nAnyone who uses phones on the go can't go wrong with the BE2.","[]","B074JG8SPQ","B074JG8SPQ","AHRVLYLZT6UTIZPJKMXM5O7C6ICA","2017-08-24 13:00:15.816","6","True","511"
"136730","5","Tinsel ... not just for decoration!","I am investing in my kids future by purchasing these.  I have four laptops, each of a different year & getting older.  In order to keep these running as long as possible, I had to revert to some newer technology like these Samsung SSD drives.  They have brought new life to the aging laptops & they now boot & run so much faster than they used to.  Still not the fastest laptops but they do hold up to the kids homework requirements.  Now I need to get my printer to print faster!\\nAfter the purchase of these, I got rid of Windows 10 which I'm still wondering if it was the best choice.  Not because it's Windows 10 but because (A), the school system relies heavily on MS Excel & Powerpoint & (B) they require certain software that runs only on Windows.  But there is a way around this; Ubuntu.  After installing Ubuntu on these drives, they have run faster & boot sooo much quicker than my Windows machine & ... there is a Windows emulator so we can run the Windows software on a Ubuntu machine (with some adjustments of course).  There was a learning curve involved after using Windows for years & I think it's good for the kids to learn of multiple software OS's, there's no telling where or what they will be working with in college & beyond.  My younger one is learning the programming of Linux & Android while playing MS Minecraft on a Ubuntu machine as well.\\nUnfortunately, these SSD's are not like the older disk style HD's where the disks spin up to a certain speed & write & read data them.  Those I liked for when they died you could get one last read out of them & transfer your important data to another drive.  With these SSD drives, when they die, they're dead!  I just had one go south on me & unfortunately, that's the nature of these beasts.  Best advice I can give for hardware like this ... backup your data OFTEN.  One of my HS kids was finishing up a homework assignment, powered off the machine & the next day turned the machine back on & it wouldn't boot up.  No accessing the HD, no getting any pertinent data off of the drive.  Aggravating, yes but I can't dock a star for it ... yet.  Now if Samsung doesn't honor the 5 year warranty then a couple stars may come off but I've had this drive for over a year & it's been a great drive.","[]","B00OAJ412U","B00OAJ412U","AEFGNYKV2TQ2GTVT2F2JEPTFN3JQ","2017-07-05 21:18:18.982","1","True","511"

I've been using the Orbi for about a week now.\\n\\nQuick, simple setup. about 20 minutes from unboxing to live online. Simple to use App (android). Placed router upstairs in master bedroom closet, near cable modem in an access panel. placed 2 satellites downstairs on opposite sides of the house.\\n\\nWe're in a 2 story, modern wood frame construction, ~1900 sq ft home.

"494607","1","Dont buy technology that breaks after 30 days and you have no way to get refund!","I have the same issue that has been reported for over a year by many others. Don’t believe all the great reviews by tech web sites. I fell for that and got burned. I increased by broadband provider speed from 25 mbps to 50 mbps after I bought a 4K TV and needed higher rate for 4K streaming video. The TP-Link C7 worked before with the lower 25 mbps broadband feed, but after the increase it kept giving degraded wireless speeds after working for about a day or less. Devices speeds would drop to below 1 mbps! I tried resetting unit firmware to factory default, unit has the latest firmware, resetting broadband modem, disconnect and reconnect devices wifi links….NOTHING worked. The only way to resolve this was to unconnected the Ethernet modem cable to the C7 and reconnect it. This means the C7 cannot effectively take and manage my broadband speed of over 25 mbps. It is a V2 C7.  So at best all I have now is a daily circumvention.  I also needed to disconnect all the existing wireless wifi sessions from every device (3 rokus, 1 samsung tv, 1 DirectTV, 3 cell phones) EVERY time to get back the highest wifi rates. Reading others in TP-LINK Archer C7 support chat boards, this has been reported by many and not been resolved in over a year. SHAME ON ME FOR BUYING SOMMETHING THAT I CANNOT RETURN AFTER 30 DAYs....using Amazon and horrible TP-Link unresponsive tech support.  So what I did to resolve is I went to Coscto and purchased a Netgear wifi router to replace my TP-Link. The Netgear works, never drops speeds over time. If I EVER HAVE A SERIOUS ISSUE FROM THIS NETGEAR UNIT I CAN RETURN IT TO COSTCO FOR FULL REFUND, NO QUESTIONS ASKED, AFTER ANY NUMBER OF DAY, MONTHS, or YEAR.  Saving maybe a few dollars on Amazon is not worth it when I end up with a $100 wifi router that is useless after 6 months on use and no path to fixing their issues.\\n\\nUpdate....TPLink issues RMA, they have had my router for 3 weeks and I have not received a replacement. They always reply they will ship one in 1 week, then nothing arrives. 3 weeks with no router and still waiting.

"934193","5","Really Great Router!!!!","This is a true beast of a router.  It will handle anything you throw at it and more importantly it will handle it with speed and consistent results.  I keep getting routers with more muscle because at last count we had 51 items connecting to the internet (both wired and wireless - mostly wireless at 18 wired devices and 33 wireless (8 people).  What with pads, and phones, and touches, and laptops and blu-ray players and projectors and even one receiver which is totally wireless (even the speakers).\\n\\nWith that tally you need a router that can process the signal at a quick speed and regulate everything evenly across the board.  I've used them all at one time or another and the only two that are worth it in my book are Netgear and TP-Link.  We use this router for wired internet across the board and we bridge it with a Netgear Orbi wireless router and two satellites (one upstairs & one downstairs) to cover the house completely with no dead spots or dropouts.  I did disconnect the Orbi and let this router handle the wifi load and it did fine, but having already configured the Orbi system I see no reason to discontinue its use since it is working so well.  No problem in getting the Orbi and the TP-Link to work together either.\\n\\nI like knowing that if the Orbi goes out this router can handle everything by itself as well.  For my wired connections the TP-Link is lightning fast and we can stream 4K to both bedrooms equipped for it and the Theater room at the same time with no lag!!  I couldn't do that with the old TP-Router!\\nThis one is a definite improvement.\\n\\nAs I've said many times I'm not a techie and I can't give you a technical breakdown of all the things this thing can do, but I'm sure there are other reviewers who can and have and you should read their reviews as well.  I can only report my results with setting this up (easy as pie) and how well it works with the system I have in place.  It has fit right in with no hiccups and is pulling its load without any added tweaking from me.  Which is good because I usually screw things up when I start tweaking.\\n\\nI highly recommend this router, especially at under a $150.00.  You can't get better for less.","[]","B0751RK6XZ","B0751RK6XZ","AHJC3CKTCCD6TC43YXE3GLDK2HKQ","2017-11-17 20:57:15.846","1","False","511"
"51293","5","Beautiful images of the Forgotten parts of Alabama","I don't know if other parts of the country are like this, but in the south (specifically Alabama) you will just be riding down a country road and suddenly, through the kudzu, you'll spy a tin roof. If you take more time to look you will see the house attached to it that is slowly succumbing to neglect and nature. There are stories in that house that you can never know, and may be completely forgotten now by those once connected with it. You may go down that road a year later, and the house will have completely fallen down. It may just be a blank forest now, or a plowed field, or a shopping center, and you'll know something has been lost.\\n\\nSince I was a child these places have fascinated me. I have very vivid memories of making the drive from Lafayette to Opelika with my mother and wondering about these places that no one was tending to anymore. Willis has gone into so many communities I have never even heard of before (there was a lot of googling happening while experiencing this book), the ones that are slowly being lost to time and technology. The &#34;forgotten&#34; places. I came across one image from Fort Deposit that was as moving as it was sad in how neglected their main street has become.\\n\\nThere are images of vacated factories and farm equipment that has been abandoned and you can only imagine that whoever left it there has forgotten they even did it. Having recently also read Historic Rural Churches of Georgia I was especially touched by the images of neglected churches that once meant so much to rural communities in the south. Especially those of the African American tradition knowing how important they were to that community.\\n\\nMy only complaint about this book are the missing timestamps for the pictures. I know they were taken over a long period of time, but I really wanted to be able to date them so I could see if some of these places are still there anymore. Of course, knowing the south and how slowly we move here, most of them are probably still going strong.\\n\\nThe type of photography that Glenn Willis exhibits in this collection is beautiful, simple, and moving. It's a little sad, it's deeply poignant, and it's completely Alabama. I adore this collection and will probably annoy people for years by making them look through it when they come over to my house. It's just too beautiful not to share.","[]","151927162X","151927162X","AFOYVFUNOONQIUAD2IRV7RUATRPQ","2017-02-18 17:45:09.000","2","False","510"
"506581","5","Since 2014, this is the BEST tablet EVERY (with keyboard).","I've owned TWO of the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 tablets, my original was the 32gb version and now I work daily on the 64gb version.  I have the attached keyboard, a Wacom Bamboo compatible stylus, and have a 128gb SD card installed for saving file (Digital art, music, and photos).  When I upgraded to the 64gb version I gave the 32gb tablet (with its own keyboard) to my partner, Rob.  Both of us have used our SGNPro 12.2 tablets, daily for the past 2 years for almost everything.  I also have a 'collection' of other android and iOS tablets, and over the years has played with all of them. I always come back to my SGNPro 12.2 as my primary, go-to, tablet.  Hands down this is the BEST tablet on the market, even 2 years later.  The tablet is well designed, solid, feature-rich, fast and dependable. I now use my SGNPro 12.2 for everything from creating digital art, to using Social Media apps, watching movies (streaming to TV if necessary), listening to music, working with photos, and all of my Office work (it runs MS Word, MS Excel, MS Powerpoint, and many other office apps extremely well).  Of course, you can save/retrieve any file with all cloud services.  IMO this is the MOST amazing tablet/laptop on the market (when you add the full-size keyboard).  There is nothing I can not do with this tablet (my Dell Windows 10 tablets, laptops and computers now collect dust).  Even today as I write this, January 21, 2017, there is NOT a better tablet, for the price, on the market.  Perhaps the Surface Pro compares, but the investment is 3-4 times more than the cost to purchase an SGNPro 12.2 plus the keyboard.  You can find this table refurbished and used at great prices, so make sure you check various web vendors before you purchase, and if you buy used/refurbished, be sure to purchase a square trade warranty.  I hope this review helps.  I consider myself to be informed and picky when it comes to laptops, tablets, and computers, so when I state that this is my best, go-to tablet, I am extremely serious about my opinion and review.  God bless and be kind to all.","[]","B00HWMPROS","B00HWMPROS","AH3LXOHEORAWJVSMQPRH7WX3KUZA","2017-01-22 18:19:11.000","21","True","510"
"538565","2","Excellent concept… poor execution.","So I personally had been wanting something like this for a long time. I have two pairs of ATH-M50x's I use them for personal audio listening, and the one thing I wished they had was Bluetooth, to pair with phones that came out recently without headphone jacks…\\n\\nThe good is that it pairs easily, it looks &#34;pretty good&#34; especially from afar, and it works. I mean, there's not too much else to ask from it. On my iPhone, pressing and holding volume up skips to the next track, pressing and holding volume down goes to the beginning of the track (and once again makes it go to the previous track), exactly how I'd expect track control buttons to function.\\n\\nHowever, there are a couple of minor flaws with this device, and at least one major flaw with it, that make me unlikely to recommend it, and likely to return it:\\n\\nFirst off I'll mention the worst thing about it, the range. If I put it in my pocket, it skips occasionally. I'm wearing Uniqlo denim jeans, not lead pants. If it can't reach from below my left ear to my left pocket there's something seriously wrong.\\n\\nNext, the build quality. It's made of cheap, creaky plastic that appears to be welded together at the seams, with hard, clicky buttons that feel very cheap. It fits the headphones seamlessly, and that part doesn't feel cheap at all, but looking at this and feeling it in my hand it doesn't really feel like they put much into making the case durable or making it feel like a high end product.\\n\\nRelatedly, this thing seems to be welded together. I can't just unscrew a couple of screws or bend a couple of clips to pop it open, say, to replace the battery in the future, or to attempt to augment the antenna. It appears opening it will damage it in such a way it cannot be closed once again.\\n\\nLastly I am not thrilled with the on-off slider switch. This is a $50 product meant for $130+ headphones. Altogether it should look and feel professional, and it should have more than a few feet of reception.\\n\\nI would not recommend it, and am likely to return it. I may attempt to design my own.","[]","B01MFFH54C","B01MFFH54C","AH2S7UFB7N4E65S5NBQZDH3NX2MQ","2017-04-14 20:51:33.000","5","True","510"
"729245","4","These sound great","I didn't these at Amazon but wish I did, OSD had a sale but for about the same price and much faster shipping I should have done Prime.\\nJust weighing in on these speakers and doing so using the price point. I have gone the more expensive outdoor speaker route and was not impressed. I then bought OSD 640 speakers and they served me well for 6 pool seasons and still going but I wanted more bass response of course. These are big, heavy speakers and like many people mentioned, their mounting brackets aren't up to snuff for horizontal mounting. With a quick test fit I knew that these would roll forward in the mounts sooner than later so made thin, round, rubber gaskets to fit between the speaker and the brackets. Problem solved, and there is still room to tighten more should I need to. The top of the brackets are wide...make sure there is plenty of solid (not drywall!) material you can drive the screws up into for horizontal mounts.\\n\\nI read lots of reviews elsewhere about how the bass performance on these is inconsistent/spotty and that they have harsh upper mid range and treble qualities. Maybe compared to upper tier stuff but I am quite impressed with the bass performance and find it to be consistent. There is a lot of treble but IMO it makes sense; this is a big, loud, bassy speaker, if it had less treble it would probably be called dull sounding. I'd rather roll off some highs than try to add more bass anyday. I did not find any unpleasant mid range issues. Mine are mounted quite close together on purpose and I have no phasing issues or dead spots, they essentially sound like one big, loud speaker which is perfect for a pool area.\\n\\nI am a little worried because a lot of reviews say their speakers simply died. I'm going on good faith given how well my 640's served me though. One thing for sure, the grilles are the same material as the 640's and will rust and need to be painted in time, I suggest doing so when new and do front and back. Also if you get sick of looking at the feet, they are easy to file off (not when mounted!) and given a good job is done, it's hard to see they were ever there.\\n\\nSo I am very pleased with speakers and feel they are a good deal for the money. One star off for the flimsy brackets though.","[]","B002BLWX2E","B086TWMTCB","AHAMNFZUBWQDDKPCIU5MHVPCWZEQ","2017-05-29 19:45:24.000","0","False","510"
"305948","5","I've tried close to 10 of these and this is the I'm sticking with...","I tried close to 10 of these bluetooth devices.  Some of them were ok. Some were terrible. This one had a few peers in quality but not in size and price.  This thing is tiny.  I use it in my car.  See pics attached. It's size is unobtrusive and hardly noticeable and works real well where I've mounted it.  Which is right next to my aux input and cigarette lighter jack.  I bought a short (6&#34;) USB 2.0 A Male to Micro B USB cable (https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B013G4EAEI).  It comes with a similar length aux cable. And together it creates a nice little setup that no ones really notices. I mounted it so that you can somewhat see the single button on the device. That button lights blue/red when you put it into pairing mode (holding the button for about 5 seconds).  That button is so flush with the device you really can't feel it or know when you are actually depressing it.  So it's important to be able to see when the color changes to the blue/red almost purple color. That means it's ready to connect with your phone.  And yes, you have to reconnect to it every time you get back in the car.  Which is the only unfortunate &#34;feature&#34; about it.  But I didn't find a single bluetooth device that would auto-reconnect after losing power in the car.  Actually it doesn't even lose power because it stays connected to the cigarette lighter power.  But the device turns itself off.  So when I get back in the car I have to hold the hard-to-feel button for about 5-6 seconds and then my phone connects on its own.  Unless someone else was last connected to the bluetooth device then sometimes I have to go into my bluetooth setting (I'm using an iPhone) and tell it to reconnect. But that is not often.  And it doesn't have to stay connected to the power in the car but for me there is no sense to ever have it unconnected.  So it just stays &#34;charging&#34; all of the time.  Overall it's a nice little quality piece of tech.  I chose it over a bunch or more expensive units (and some cheaper ones).  Don't hesitate to buy it if you need simple and solid.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PbQ6Qyr9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PbQ6Qyr9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PbQ6Qyr9L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vi95LonbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vi95LonbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vi95LonbL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71W-4SNKFfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71W-4SNKFfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71W-4SNKFfL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81uWAUqHpwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81uWAUqHpwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81uWAUqHpwL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01B4W40VC","B0C7KLM8L2","AEKEY3X6HKPAIT2EXLFPCDPVOR7A","2017-05-21 21:58:09.000","65","True","510"
"809341","3","Like the X2, very good running Bluetooth headset...when they work.","Expect a year of use or less if you use them a lot/sweat a lot/live in a humid environment.\\n\\nI owned the X2 before these and owned them for about 3 years.  After about 1 1/2 years, the first set of X2 died which Jaybird replaced for free.  Second set lasted another 1 1/2 years after which they said they couldn't replace again.  Figuring 3 years is OK with me (over span of 2 headsets), I opted to just purchase the X3s.\\n\\nThe X3s sound just as good as the X2 and fit better (I can run with them without the wings attached when running them over the ears to the back of head) but, unfortunately, the waterproofing is no better or worse.  I bought these May 2017 and run outdoors in Maryland (meaning hot and humid summers) and I tend to sweat a lot.  So far, I hadn't had trouble with them.  It's now November 2017 and I'm in Jamaica and managed to get exactly ONE workout with them indoors on a treadmill before they died.  They worked just fine during my workout.  Next day, I tried to turn them on at the gym and nothing.  Not exactly what you'd want while on vacation trying to get a workout in.  Went through the whole 8 times button pushing and then holding followed by 2 more times of repeating to reset then plugging in to charge bit.  After charging for 3 hours (supposed to be 2.5 hours but the light never turned green), I tried turning them on and low and behold they turned on...but only the left headset made any sound.  Right one was completely dead.  Next day, the unit is completely dead again.  For the record, the &#34;reset&#34; procedure didn't do a thing for my X2 either after it refused to turn on.  I make sure to take care of my headphones and dry them after every workout and store them in their case.  I never get them wet (outside of my workout sweat) so I don't abuse them in any way and expect them to last but all 3 units have disappointed in reliability, especially the X3s. Having a set of headsets that cost this much last barely 6 months is unacceptable.\\n\\nGuess I'll be going through another round of warranty replacement but after this I might look elsewhere.","[]","B01M2UVSHF","B01M2UVSHF","AECONJIFULTAIUIZTMA37RSP3IWQ","2017-11-11 01:17:07.151","2","True","510"

"875398","5","Standing firm.","The Benro tripod is a great choice for me as a travel tripod and fundamentally, when I consider how often I actually use any tripod probably all the tripod I need.  I’m not a professional  and don’t hold any pretensions I am a highly proficient  hobbyist but I do have a couple of lighter weight mirrorless DSLRs I would be remorseful to see damaged in an unfortunate accident because I attempted to cheap out.  This model may not have the name recognition of some higher profile manufacturers,  but it is solidly built with quality components and is very competitively priced.\\n\\nThe published maximum load capacity for the Benro is 8.8lbs, comfortably above the combined weight total of my heftiest DSLR camera and glass (70-200mm) combination. With its slim form factor, the tripod is convenient to tote around and while based on operation it might not be the fastest to setup or breakdown for relocation, all of the locking features for legs, center column, ballhead, and quick release plate are easy to adjust.  When I tried it out at the maximum height setting of 57.6” (center column fully extended), it still remains sturdy and secure.\\n\\n The telescoping leg sectionas can be locked by a counter clockwise half turn of the three leg lock grips of each leg. There is also a tab at the top of each leg to lock alignment. It should be noted the individually adjustable legs can be positioned for uneven surfaces but the leg bottoms are rubber padded, not spiked. The slotted center column has a spring loaded hook for attachment of a camera bag or other item for enhanced weight and stability. The center column is also reversible to facilitate ground level or macro photography.\\n\\nThis model has very convenient Arca-Swiss style quick release mounting plates and the mounting platform also has a bubble level to assist with camera positioning.  There is also a bubble level on the shoulder for positioning and leg alignment.  The ballhead can be positioned up to a 90° vertical orientation and 360° horizontal although this model is not an optimal choice for use in filming video.\\n\\nPotential purchasers with full size DSLRs or who customarily work with heavy, lengthy lenses may have needs beyond the scope of this tripod however in my opinion, for the money for users of compact DSLRs, DSLTs or hybrids, the Benro is a very attractive option.","[]","B072K62KMH","B071X8QSZH","AEOCNRTRQ3WTNPMXNC65X4J4KNGQ","2017-09-21 22:59:52.493","6","False","510"

There are some significant differences in features however that lead me to prefer the Linksys model, although another user may prefer this unit for exactly the reasons I’m not particularly enthusiastic about it. Although it has very little to do with anything that should matter, let’s get this out there from the start. Comparably, this D-Link model feels insubstantial and in my opinion is just a plain looking butt ugly box with four poles sticking up…\\n\\nI would consider the range for either model to be a toss-up and in my situation in order to even come close to achieving the coverage I need, both units have to be supplemented by a range extender. This is especially the case with the 5Ghz signal as without utilization of another piece of hardware network connectivity invariably defaults to “n,” and the 2.4 Ghz signal in some admittedly challenging areas of my house.\\n\\nThe Dlink has dynamic selection of broadcasts, meaning the device connects to whichever signal it determines is optimal and only one SSID is broadcast if the user searches for available networks. It may not be all that critical for many users, but I would prefer to control choice for selected devices myself but I don’t want to disable the capability to connect to either band at the device end to insure it only connects to the band I prefer for it at different junctures.\\n\\nOne very noticeable and pertinent difference is in administrative task functionality. The D-Link has what I consider to be a parred down menuing system with numerable customary user modifiable settings not easily accessible. While the new administrative user interface might prove convenient for users who do not have significant interests in tinkering, there’s very little available for those of us who do.\\n\\nThe Dlink has front positioned indicator lamps for power, internet connectivity and 2.4/5Ghz broadcasts while the Linksys model only has an illuminated logo for visible status indication. Problem is, the green lamps on the DLink are so dim, they’re virtually useless to me.","[]","B06XGB3X7R","B06XGB3X7R","AEOCNRTRQ3WTNPMXNC65X4J4KNGQ","2017-07-23 18:14:19.486","0","False","510"
"169929","4","A great choice if you can't spend more than $20.","Appearance: First off, what you see in the photo is what it looks like. It really does look and feel nice; it's comfortable on the head after I set them over books to relieve some of the clamping force. It has a pleather memory foam ear pads and head pads. It is the texturized black rubber with plastic chrome accents. They do fold up on themselves, and come in a case and a 3.5mm cable. The cable is pretty generic, but I don't seem to have any crackling or other interference when used. It does have a play/pause button in-line with the cable and it doesn't work when used with my computer or iPhone (not a deal breaker for me). There is a very thin layer of felt that covers the drivers. To say the least, the build quality is almost as good as the $99 iHip Bluetooth headphones.\\n\\nSound: I do not consider myself and audiophile, and my ears are going to be different than anyone else's. So take my opinion lightly. The bass is tight and not muddied, but I would have liked to have a little more impact. I did try to turn the lower end using the equalizer on my PC, but it only distorts it. I think the only way to get booming bass would be to get 50mm headphones. The mids are good. I didn't feel like they needed adjusted at all. The highs, though, are a little higher than what I typically like. Turning them down ever so slightly on the EQ made them better. However, the over sound can be tinny at times. The S's are a little harsh, but my ears got used to it after a few listens. I did have some 1/16&#34; porous foam that I cut out and fit inside the ears. I feel like it made the soundstage smaller and made the tinny sound better.\\n\\nOverall: If you have a budget of $20 or less, I recommend these headphones. They look and sound great considering the price point. If you have $50 to spend, I would look into the Superlux 681 EVOs. But I will say that different apps and devices will make it sound better or worse. Pandora from iPhone was terrible, but YouTube and downloaded music were good. The PC gave me the best sound in every situation. I might look into getting a DAC down the road to see if it enhances the drivers.","[]","B01AAU6OR2","B01AAU6OR2","AEFZUAWFAM7Y7JEMEX3NGEADJCLQ","2017-01-30 04:15:53.000","0","True","510"
"331245","5","Great picture, great features, and $300-$400 less than a comparable TV. If you're a cable cutter, this is a no brainer.","I didn't buy this TV from Amazon, but I like leaving my reviews here since a lot of people check them. I got the Best Buy version. The only difference is it doesn't come with the remote that you can plug headphones in. It's the TCL 55P605 model.\\n\\nI tired a 2016 LG model that cost $300 dollars more than what I paid for this TV and I hated it. The upscaled picture on the LG was horrible. This TV has a very good picture. It's bright, the color is great, it upscales well, and 4k content looks amazing. 1080P and even 720P content upscales to 4k very well. To be mindful that the picture is set to a low power mode by default that is easily switched off. Also, you have to adjust the picture setting for each input you use. Personally, I like this since on my cable box I don't use the local contrast setting, but on streaming movies I do. Take the time to tinker with the picture setting to get an even better picture out of this TV. I was nervous buying a TV from a manufacturer that I had never heard of, but I am very glad that I gave it a try. If you took the TCL badge of this TV and replaced it with Samsung then this TV, with its picture, would probably sell for $900 or more. On top of the great picture and features, you have Roku built in that works exactly like a Roku box does. I don't even have my Amazon Fire TV box hooked up anymore.\\n\\nI can't tell you how well the speakers are on this TV since I use a soundbar. If there is a con to this TV then it would probably have to be the aesthetics. It's not an ugly TV, but there is nothing special about the look of it. To be honest, I couldn't care less about the look of the half-inch bezel around the screen. Is this TV on the same level and an LG or Samsung OLED TV? No, but it easily competes with TVs that cost $300-$400 more and that's not even taking into consideration having Roku build in.\\n\\nI have to say I am extremely happy with this purchase. I initially bought the lower model the TCL 55S405 which I was also happy with except it didn't get as bright as would have liked and the viewing angles weren't as good.","[]","B06Y6FSV5Q","B06Y6FSV5Q","AGHFP6NOFIOPNUIFP2IINVXNSHBQ","2017-09-26 01:36:08.107","3","False","510"
"509578","4","... new several years ago they seem to be in good shape. They were obviously not new as there ...","Update: 5\\15\\19\\nIt's been about 5 years now since purchasing my first set and despite the damage mentioned in the original review they are still working. The battery life has shortened to about 2.5-3 hours and the rubber coating is parting fron the wires at most of the connection points but they still pair and sound fine. I have noticed they seem to struggle to pair with my Samsung 9S+ much more than they ever have with my iPhone 6S+ and are more likely to break up the audio with the Samsung. If both phones are nearby and bluetooth on they will always favor pairing with the iPhone by default. May be compatibility issues since it affects all 3 working sets. I keep expecting them to die on me (hence having purchased replacements) but so far they just have some discoloration and wear and tear. Can't really complain at this point\\n\\nOriginal: Comparing to the set I bought new several years ago they seem to be in good shape. They were obviously not new as there was no security seal and everything seemed to be just thrown into the box rather than placed with intent. I'll update if anything seems fishy but so far they don't appear to be a knock off.\\n\\nThe Beats 2 in general have been wonderful for me. I don't use in high moisture situations (I sweat a bit at work but I'm not doing constant cardio) so others may see shorter life. That being said my last pair has been consistently used for almost 3 years now. The first thing to die was the rubber holding the mic/pause button in place. One day it just seemed to sort of melt in my hand leaving the inner working and plastic beneath fully exposed and taking the volume controls with it. Despite the added vulnerability of the unsealed controls it has continued to work for months since then. I finally elected to replace them because it looks like the plastic in that area is splitting with nothing to keep it together and I expect they will fail soon.\\n\\nI do wish the battery life was closer to 12 hours rather than 4-6 (my average on a full night's charge) but chose to get another pair of these due to low reviews and high complaints on the Beats 3.\\n\\nI do try to be gentle with them when untangling and such (rather than jerking or pulling them apart) but I've seen no signs of failure other than the mic button.","[]","B016A6IGRQ","B016A6IGRQ","AELQWTOFXTBR57XI5QLCZVSMDFHQ","2017-09-11 14:23:48.544","3","True","510"
"967808","4","POSSIBLY THE BEST BRIDGE CAMERA IN THE WORLD","I have owned this camera for well over 2 years now. Although it has a few minor irritations, I can say it's the best fixed lens camera on the planet.\\n\\nPROS:\\n-Very nice lens.. it's sharp even at full zoom.\\n-Very fast and advanced world-class autofocus.\\n-Extreme versatility in range...from 24mm to 600mm (and beyond in digital crop mode). No more lenses to carry!\\n-Blends technology and old school features like a tactile aperature ring, cable release threads, and full manual capability.\\n-25 frames per second capability is mind blowing and useful for motorsports and other action.\\n-Good built in flash although the lens hood can create shadows if you are shooting low to the ground.\\n-Feels rugged and quality made.\\n-4K video\\n-Great slow motion capablitity.\\n-Sophisticated 1 inch sensor.\\n\\nCONS:\\n-Rather heavy for a travel camera.\\n-Redundant manual exposure wheel is poorly located and can be accidentally bumped.\\n-Lens expands and retracts everytime you power up or down the camera.\\n-Although autofocus is amazing, it can be disrupted if your nose touches the viewscreen. Happens to me frequently and my nose is ""normal"" lol.\\n-some discernible vignetting at longer zoom ranges in the sky.\\n-No time lapse is actually a disappointment.\\n-No built in neutral density filter is a weird omission.\\n-Menus are pretty complex and require a substantial learning curve.\\n-View finder can flip up or down but does not rotate in all directions.\\n-No external battery charger so you will need to buy one if you want to be able to charge a battery while shooting with another. I have several batteries and a 2 battery charger.\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nAlthough not quite pro-level when it compares to the resolution and light gathering capability of a full frame sensor, the RX10MK4 is the only bridge camera that WILL give you pro results in most situations. It is so capable that you will feel liberated leaving all those old lenses behind. It gives you the feeling that you can shoot anything anywhere at anytime, which gives you exciting creative and journalistic freedom.","[]","B075KTJJPC","B077867KXK","AHO4WZKZEAP3SYSGT3JKPUCALDBQ","2017-12-13 17:10:30.520","25","False","510"
"397708","2","Not durable enough for travel, does not fit 17"" laptops.","EDIT: I have lowered my rating for this product to two stars.  I used this bag for thirteen months.  The best things about this bag are it's appearance, which is honestly quite stylish, the number of pockets which gives it exceptional utility, and the price, which is aggressively low for a messenger bag with this much utility.  Unfortunately, once I started using this bag for travel as a consequence of work, it quickly stressed and failed.  None of the pockets have any kind of reinforcement, so they bulge instead of holding shape when any of them become more than half-full; which requires filling the large middle pocket first with your largest objects before filling the inner pockets if you need to fill this bag.  The laptop sleeve can hold 17&#34; laptops if they are thin, like an ultrabook or a macbook; The sleeve in mine could physically hold a 17&#34; workstation class laptop but did so tightly that it would frequently snag in the pocket and get caught on the zipper when trying to remove it.  The velcro tie strap very quickly became overstretched which resulted in it getting a run, as well as the vinyl fabric where the velcro attaches to beginning to tear.\\n\\nThere is also no padding on the back side or bottom of this bag, so it will not protect your electronics if you mistakenly drop the bag from more than a foot or so off the ground.  When the bag is full, it bulges and becomes more round, which makes it very uncomfortable to carry on your hip.  It lacks a strap on the back of the unit to allow you to attach it to a piece of luggage.  Finally, the top zipper broke on it after teeth fell out and the zipper snagged on it.\\n\\nSince I originally purchased this bag, there have been several reviews on this product remarking on the top zipper breaking, so this is not an uncommon failure.  Even when new, they lacked smooth action like you would get on a zipper from a Samsonite product.  I would not recommend this bag for anything other than light duty work; where the ability to tightly and safely secure everything in the bag is not important, and if you do not plan to frequently carry it through airports or on business trips.\\n\\nAlso, the leather tie-down straps and canvas carrying strap cannot be removed, making this impossible to wash.  Mine smelled quite ripe when I decommissioned it.","[]","B06XW6WLKP","B06XW6WLKP","AFV63D7JPMRSLY6VB6HUL435QPPA","2017-08-08 18:37:29.333","2","True","510"
"698025","2","Can't be trusted unfortunately","I am an avid golfer and I had been using a Bushnell range finder for years and loved it.  However, one day, I was playing in a charity golf tournament and couldn't see the pin over a hill in the fairway.  I took the yardage to a tree behind the green and clubbed down, however, I misjudged it and went OB into the bushes behind the green.  That's when I decided I should also have a GPS rangefinder for those situations, so I tried this.\\n\\nPros:\\n-  Very small and easy to keep in your pocket or clip on your belt.\\n\\nCons:\\n-  Yardage on most courses I played was very hit or miss (Your local course might also be unavailable).  Some courses, they were great, others I was consistently flying the greens and when checked by laser, realized it was off.\\n-  The GPS decides based on your location what hole you're on.  So, once I was playing on a course where the fairways were next to each other and I sliced a drive on the 7th hole (yeah, I admit it) into the fairway of the 8th hole.  When I got there to hit my ball back to the 7th green, it thought I was playing the 8th and would only give me the yardage to that green.  Once, even though I was in the treeline of one hole, it still thought I was playing the hole next to it.\\n-  You need to wait for the GPS to find your location and get situated.  Once, on the first tee, I was waiting so long that I didn't even get to use it until the 2nd hole.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI still think that my Bushnell laser range finder is absolutely the best.  It is extremely accurate and in a range finder, that is all that matters.  Plus you can get the exact yardage to that day's pin placements.  However, laser range finders only work if you have line of sight, so take that into consideration.  Ultimately, the reason I don't like this product is that I don't trust it.  In golf, you need to trust your read of the green, club selection, swing, etc.  If I can't trust it, I can't use it, simple as that.","[]","B0077RH91M","B0077RH91M","AF636443F66WOV3EWRHIE2A4D32Q","2017-12-05 08:54:28.943","3","True","510"

But then, I'm no audiophile so my opinion of sound quality is suspect. Got really bold and attempted connecting the Dot to my sound bar. Another effortless process and...WOW...what a vibrant sound. I also linked the Dot to my home security system.

"829916","5","Exceeded my high expectations.","Oh my goodness! I expected this to be a great product. I've owned a 10&#34; Polk powered subwoofer that I bought from Circuit City (remember them) many years ago. I've had to replace the speaker itself in the unit (I did so with a nice Cerwin Vega that has been going strong for years now), The original one started sounding distorted. With the replacement, it is still in operation and has served me well over the years. Several years ago the amp blew up. Polk customer service was very helpful and replaced it for me. Therefore, I always intended to be a repeat customer. They are an American company by the way. I've had my eye on the PSW505 for a long time. For some reason the price greatly fluctuates. It's already back up to $213 on Amazon just that fast. I've seen it selling for much more as well. Just last week I saw that Polk was selling it directly through eBay and Amazon for $179. I ended up buying on it on eBay because I had some eBay bucks accumulated that brought the price down to $160 for me, shipped to my door directly from Polk with the full warranty. I couldn't pass it up. It arrived yesterday, several days earlier than expected. I immediately paired with my existing Polk subwoofer and my Sony STR DN1070's 7.2 setup. Wow. My expectations have been exceeded. This thing really thumps and thunders. It literally shakes the whole house, light fixtures, windows, everything. You will be alerted to things that need to be tightened down or secured better. I've been putting it through some tests. Using the LFE connection. It sounds very, very good. It sounds and works well all by itself without the second subwoofer. The two together is almost too much. I love it though because I love thumping bass. Movies, music, everything sounds good. I've turned the volume all the way up for testing and to revel in all the thundering bass. However, even half volume is plenty and sounds great. I really crank the volume when I'm home alone or don't have annoyed housemates. My home setup now competes with the booming sound system in my SUV. For the price, i don't see how anything could possibly be better. If you are thinking about buying, just do it. I highly recommend it. If anyone knows of something better for the price, by all means, please enlighten me.","[]","B000092TT0","B01MQJ2XE6","AENSNBCYX4OQIUP7XNOX43OXZSCA","2017-01-17 16:36:35.000","0","False","510"

But as we all know, Samsung missed their announced ship dates several times and by several months -- and the 960 drives are still scarce.\\n\\nThis left me looking for a “stand in” NVMe drive until the 960s started shipping. I didn’t want the Intel 600P because of the very poor reviews and lackluster performance (for an NVMe drive). Some reviewers have stated that enthusiast-level SATA III SSDs will perform better than the 600Ps.\\n\\nThen, on Tom’s Hardware (a highly reputable review website), I ran across an excellent review on the MyDigital BPX 240GB NVMe drive. The performance for a $114.95 NVMe drive was ranked as outstanding. So I decided to order one and give it a try. I received the drive just after Thanksgiving so I have it for several months.\\n\\nThe drive installed with no issues and upon benchmarking it with ATTO and CrystalDiskMark, it exceeded the advertised specifications.\\n\\nMoreover, it utilizes (the better) MLC flash rather than (the poorer) TLC flash and not only comes with a 5 year warranty, but has an unbelievable TBW (Terabytes Written) endurance rating of 700 (the TBW rating of the equivalent Intel 600P, for example, is just 72, and it’s only 100 on the 250GB Samsung 960 EVO).\\n\\nAdditionally, not only does the MyDigital BPX ship with the (elusive) screw needed to secure it to the MB, but it even comes with a small screwdriver. During the installation I had a question and phoned MyDigital and got an immediate answer. Great customer service.\\n\\nMy personal experience with this drive has been very positive and I would highly recommend it. I know of no other NVMe drive in this price range with the performance, warranty and endurance rating.\\n\\nI will probably go ahead and purchase the Samsung 500GB EVO 960 when they are plentiful but truly, in day-to-day usage, I cannot tell any difference between the MyDigital 240GB BPX and a Samsung 256GB Pro 950 I have in another notebook.

However, I have done a &#34;dry run&#34; and they bag holds an amazing amount of stuff. I have a Canon 70D camera with a 28-135mm lens attached, with a hood attached (not in the reversed position), as well as a neck strap, and it fits into the bag with no problem whatsoever. There is even room to slip in the external Speedlite in its case alongside it. In the back zipper pocket, I have room for my wallet, tissues, lip gloss, and a few granola bars. The top part is a bit small for my sunglasses, as they are in this huge case, but it does hold my blood glucose meter, as I am a diabetic. The front zip pocket is large enough to hold an external battery pack, as well as a few other small items. There are additional pockets for small items. I think overall, I will be able to fit everything I need for a day of sight-seeing into the bag without a problem. And I'm sure I'll figure out something for the sunglasses - I really do need to find a smaller case for them! I like the fact that this is a cross-body bag, as I have had neck surgeries and have back problems, so this is distributing the weight better. The bag itself does not really weigh much at all. And you can wear it behind you, riding on your hip, or turned to the front. And it is easy to reposition, so you can pull it to the front and pull your camera out quite quickly and easily, as well as put it back. Many of the cases I have make it difficult to do this unless you take them off and put them down, or you are in jeopardy of the camera dropping out. There is no worry of that with this one - the bag remains very stable. I also like the fact that it has that pocket on the backside of the bag (the side facing your body) and that it is able to hold so much. By keeping valuables there, it cannot be unzipped and pickpocketed, even if you are wearing it around to your back. And to get to the camera, they have to undo a clasp, and then undo the drawstring of the inner bag to get to the camera compartment. So basically, you are going to know if someone is messing with it!","[]","B01LWL5O35","B01LWL5O35","AFRE5H7UNSLNKZ6UOKZVZTMVQKSA","2017-03-27 08:11:17.000","8","True","510"
"442027","5","Surprised by the quality","I've never had much luck with mini keyboards. Either one or more keys have a problem registering keystrokes or the keyboard configuration has something quirky about it. This Bluetooth keyboard seems to fix both those problems for me.\\n\\nSo far I haven't had a problem with any keys, including the space-bar, not registering. When pressing the keys, they feel firm instead of loose and don't feel cheaply made. The keyboard configuration is ideal for me. One problem I've had with other mini keyboards is the placement of the right shift key being small, too far to the right and difficult to reach. This keyboard has it in the right position, and both shift keys are larger than the other keys. That makes them easy to use without needing to look down at the keyboard.\\n\\nThis keyboard also connects easily with all my Android tablets and phone. I did have an issue with one of my tablets, but it was a tablet issue and not a problem with the keyboard, which I figured out.\\n\\nI like that this keyboard doesn't slow my typing down like other mini keyboards I've used.\\n\\nAnother feature I like about this keyboard is that the top flap folds back to form a stand for your mobile device. So you can put a tablet there and use it like a laptop. Good design.\\n\\nI haven't had this keyboard long, so I can't attest to its longevity, but if its lifespan doesn't live up to my expectation, I'll add that to this review.\\n\\nThe case that comes with the keyboard has a magnetic plate on the bottom flap that the keyboard magnetically attaches to, which makes it easy to detach from and attach to the case.\\n\\nMy only beef with this keyboard is the instructions that come with it. It mentions nothing about how to charge it. It comes with a short USB-to-USB-B converter cable but no adapter. You can use the same cable that you use with your Android device to charge the keyboard, or you can use a regular USB cable and attach the cable converter that comes with it. It's easy to figure out how to charge it, but I thought it was odd that the instructions didn't include any information about it. Other than that, the instructions were adequate enough for me.\\n\\nIn all, based on my impression of this rechargeable Bluetooth keyboard, I would definitely recommend it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HvxkVuR0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HvxkVuR0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HvxkVuR0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J4qGUSCQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J4qGUSCQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J4qGUSCQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51eTCDvWdFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51eTCDvWdFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51eTCDvWdFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00T7GDZXM","B00T7GDZXM","AF6WB34M656XYWLCXVV2UZ7W5GWA","2017-04-18 22:35:33.000","10","True","510"

"354998","5","A very nice bag.","Not as large or small as I thought. It was hard to tell from reviews about its size, with some people griping about it being too big, others about being too small. It depends on the usage you have in mind, as to the size you need.\\n\\nI replaced a Crumpler Three Million Dollar Home as I've outgrown it over time. I wanted a bag to carry my Gripped 650D and a few extra items so I don't have to take the entire Canon backpack on a hiking trail, or short walk to an overlook at a nat'l park. or, a camera bag with only a camera, with bulging pockets full of filter sets, etc.\\n\\nContents: The gripped Canon has an 18-135mm which isn't that small of a lens. (My favorite walkabout lens) A Cokin filter set with 67mm and 77mm rings. Another filter set for 67mm & 77mm with screw-on CPL's etc. A Speedlite. A Speedlite extension/remote cable. A remote/timer/time lapse interval controller. Stack of macro tubes and Tamron 1.8x lens extender. Tamron 10-24mm wide angle lens. (Bigger than a pop can) A Canon &#34;elbow&#34; 90 degree adapter for doing low camera work. A canon magnifier. (Both items are viewfinder attachments) A 6&#34; lite disk for scene lighting. (Gold on one side, silver the other) Extra batteries, and charger. Batteries are rechargeable AA's for the grip, and a couple Canon LP-E8 flatties for the camera itself. And, of course, 3M microfiber cleaning cloths, lens cleaner pen, Canon USB data cable, etc. That's a lot of stuff for a bag that's about 9x9x14 inches overall.\\n\\nMy 100-400L was just to big for this bag, (monster) but it has its own anyway. To get a bag large enough for it too, and it would need wheels. This bag is great for a trail walk so you have most everything you need on your shoulder. Easy carry for me as it isn't too big with a shoulder strap as you can swing it somewhat behind.\\n\\nI like the light grey interior, you won't lose anything in there like a typical black inside bag.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710Rdqv+1DL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710Rdqv+1DL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710Rdqv+1DL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ChDSROD-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ChDSROD-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ChDSROD-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XXuXWY58L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XXuXWY58L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XXuXWY58L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B0002Y5WZM","B00WUIIX72","AGAJOT3CFNH5MTGPN62VRHNNSHOQ","2017-07-21 17:51:51.837","9","True","510"
"696940","5","Exactly what I've been waiting for!","Set this up over the weekend and am thoroughly impressed. First off, I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought I might have to go in and configure a number of settings in my router, which can be a pain in the butt. However, what I got was so simple, I'm still in a bit of shock.\\n\\nThe system works beautifully creating a WiFi mesh network, extending my router speed across the entire house and basement. In a nutshell you take the first Google WiFi router, plug it into one of the regular Ethernet ports, activate it within the Google WiFi app (via scanning the QR code), then put the location of the second one, plug it in, enable it within the app (via scanning), and repeat the same for the last one. Each of the mini Google WiFi extenders will speak with each other passing data throughout the house AND allow you to plug devices into both of their ethernet ports on the extenders.\\n\\nSo for example, I plugged my PS4 in the basement into the WiFi extenders via an Ethernet cord. Which gave me much faster speeds than through my normal WiFi connection. The same went for my computer in my office and the Tivo Mini. I guess you can say that the wireless data speed on the mesh network is so fast that its like plugging my devices into a virtual ethernet cord.\\n\\nTo give you a couple comparisons, I'm paying for 50mbps Verizon Fios. My PS4 went from around a 15 mbps WiFi connection in my basement to 46mbps connection when I plugged it into the Google WiFi extender. My desktop computer in the office was using one of those TP Link plug-in ethernet extenders and went from 11mbps (crappy house wiring) to 45mbps via Google WiFi extender. I'm not sure what speed my Tivo Mini was running on, but it's probably around the same speed. I have had issues in the past where it would skip during playback or while watching live tv through it if the connection speed wasn't fast enough, but that doesn't appear to be an issue with Google WiFi.\\n\\nIt should also be noted that even though this system makes it's own super fast network, the existing networks created by my Verizon Fios router are still active. So it's like having 3 networks in my home. I should probably shut those down, but I don't think they're hurting anything.","[]","B01MAW2294","B08V2MLHLN","AELQHUHLVGMKGRLPPNF4CV6IRUSA","2017-08-07 20:05:54.020","1","True","510"
"76264","3","Works great for some things, but some annoying quirks and limitations","Purchased this to control three devices:\\nSamsung UN48J520DAFXZA TV\\nYamaha ATS-1060 35&#34; 2.1 Channel Soundbar\\nPlaystation 4\\n\\nIt does an okay job most of the time.  Sometimes it seems that commands aren't relayed properly to the devices, though.  For instance, sometimes when I execute the &#34;Watch TV&#34; activity (which is supposed to turn on the TV and set it to HDMI 2 input, turn on the Yamaha soundbar and set it to the TV input) it will fail to set my devices to the proper inputs.  Sometimes it will simply fail to turn on the soundbar altogether.  I've set the command delays higher, placed the IR blaster in what it says is the optimal position in front of both devices, and other troubleshooting steps outlined on the Harmony support site, but it still fails about 15% of the time.  The workaround for me is just to hit the activity button a second time, but it's annoying that I have to do that.  It also cannot reliably switch between two activities (e.g. go from watching TV to listening to music, which is supposed to set the soundbar to bluetooth input and turn the TV off).  The workaround for that is to hit the off button, turning everything off, wait for a few seconds, and then hit the &#34;Listen to music&#34; activity button--which I sometimes have to hit twice, see above.\\n\\nAlso, the PS4 support sucks, which I know isn't Logitech's fault (Sony doesn't want to play nice with other companies when it comes to PS4 control), but it's still worth mentioning as I use my PS4 to watch Netflix and HBO Now.  I ended up programming the Harmony remote to use TV commands to control the PS4 (employing Anynet+), which works for lots of things, but not everything.  For example, the four main PS4 controller buttons (i.e. circle, square, cross and triangle) are not effectively emulated, and there's no Anynet+ equivalent for those.  So I still have to bust out the PS4 controller for some things.\\n\\nTL;DR - when it works, it's great.  When it doesn't, it's annoying.","[]","B00N3RFC4G","B00O4RRHP6","AHGUNINKBIW54PDJKDMXVBJ4NV5A","2017-08-30 21:42:13.075","0","True","510"
"52523","1","Nightmare!!","This is a horrid product!  I spent half a day on the phone regarding this CD player!  I wish I had spent a little more to buy a decent alternative.\\n\\nI have numerous books on CD.  I purchased two units, one for my son and one for myself.  We gave my son his on his birthday.  Though he was excited initially, he stopped using it the first day!  Because it was a gift, he did not want to sound ungrateful and complain about it.  When I pressed him about why he was not using it, he commented that it was hard to complete a full chapter.\\n\\nMonths later, I opened the package of my CD player.  The first day, I understood that the unit was poorly designed!  I would listen to half or three quarters of a chapter and suddenly the unit stopped playing.  I needed to eject the CD and restart the chapter.  When I tried to advance to try to relocate my place in the book, the unit shut off even more quickly!  Thus, I found it easier to listen to the same chapter from the beginning.  One time, I listened to the chapter half a dozen times because I wondered if I accidentally pushed a button on the unit.  The same thing occurred even when the player was stationary.  I finally inserted the CD in my home stereo system unit to finish the book.\\n\\nMy older sons had CD players that they listened to all the time.  I never recall them experiencing any of these frustrations.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I discovered the problem too late because I neglected to use my unit before the time to send it back to Amazon expired.  I thought that everything would be fine because I purchased the Extended Warranty.  That was my second mistake!  It took me hours of chatting with Square Trade to learn that the first year, the CD player is under the manufacturer's warranty.\\n\\nI am suppose to ship the player back to the manufacturer at my expense according to the manufacturer.  Square Trade may cover the shipping cost, but is it worth all the time and bother?  I already spent 3-4 hours on the computer chatting and on the phone with Square Trade and the manufacturer's representatives today!  Everyone constantly assured me that my concerns would be resolved quickly!  Ugh!\\n\\nMy advise...Spend a little extra on a better unit.","[]","B003XQPK76","B00XJWAP4W","AHY5W7BXB5XQHXMEWS6SB4WJFLEA","2017-10-05 01:37:05.263","34","True","510"
"48085","5","Durable and slick, easy installation","Before I go into this review, I want to put this out there: HTC, making the edges of your screen glass curved was a questionable decision at best.\\n\\nOK! So, here's the deal: because of the curved glass edges, screen protectors can only do so much. You've got your soft plastic full screen protectors, which go edge to edge and cover everything from scratches but won't help much against hard impacts or drops, and don't mesh well with cases that come up over the lip of the phone. Then you've got these tempered glass protectors, which can only really cover the display screen and touch buttons and cannot go edge to edge because of the curved glass (the rigid tempered glass can't conform to the curved edges and will eventually come off,) but they protect very well against hard impacts and cases with raised lips won't interfere with them.\\n\\nThis particular screen protector covers the entirety of the display screen, the buttons on the bottom, and most of the glass above the screen. I have a case with a raised lip that comes up over the edges of the phone, so there's a 1.5mm gap all the way around the screen between the protector and the case. If it gets scratched, it won't interfere with the display or the buttons, and between the raised tempered glass and the raised lip of the case, I'm not concerned about anything striking that small edge hard enough to do any damage.\\n\\nThe other thing I'd like to note is that tempered glass screen protectors are not invulnerable. If you drop something on your phone or drop your phone on something, the screen protector may break. But that's significantly better, and way cheaper, than your phone screen breaking. I would rather replace a relatively cheap protector than a $600 phone, even with insurance. So far, this protector has not cracked or broken through several clumsy drops onto hard flooring, so it's pretty tough. It feels great too; not so thick that it interferes with the touchscreen sensitivity, and no oily or grippy plastic feel. It doesn't attract fingerprints or oil residue, and it cleans really well.\\n\\nI used the hinge method (video link is in the instructions - lengthy to explain, very easy to understand once you see it) to put this protector on and it worked like a charm on the first try. Take your time with it, because it's worth doing right the first time.","[]","B01CSDAB0K","B01CSDAB0K","AFMRVLTNVAZVZHBOYYSY257EZRIQ","2017-05-04 23:15:21.000","1","True","510"
"930694","5","Best pair of in ear buds I've ever purchased.","Though the rubber that wraps around your ear seems very flimsy they do their job perfectly and I actually like that they are. The ear wraps are super comfortable and once you have them wrapped don't expect these to fall out. I've tried all sorts of work outs and head banging and these will not fall out! Just what I wanted with also very very very perfect sound clarity for ear phones. I'm borderline audiophile from my collection of headphones and interest in sound and tech. I have a pair of Audio technicas ath-m50's and sennheisers 363D. These sound nothing like those but they aren't suppose to. These are ear phones not studio quality headphones; also don't believe any company that says that their ear phones have added bass. There is no where that is possible because added subs aren't possible, I would believe if a ear company said that they had added tweeters before I did added bass. Your phone has a sound card just like anything else and even though you may have a 1000 dollar iphone whatever they just came out with. I'm pretty positive that the sound card inside your over a thousand dollar phone isn't any better than the sound card in the past 3 to 5 generations. It's a gimmick much like dpi for gaming mice.\\n\\nBut I'll let you in on a little secret many of you don't know about. Do you actually want quality highs and lows and even mids with soundstage? Download poweramp! You will have to spend about 5 after the trial period but you can even make your very own equalizer setting! How insane is that? Poweramp is literally your only way of having added bass which so many of you care about so much for some odd reason. Please please please stop falling for the Gimmick of &#34;added bass&#34;.\\n\\nI will say though the sound quality of this bluetooth to the thousands of other wired earphones I've used over the years trying to avoid bluetooth is little to none. I actually wish I bought these sooner for the price of 40 over the hundreds of dollars for wired ear phones. I popped these babies in and not only did they seal in the sound which is also another issue I've been trying to eliminate but Nine inch nails Me I'n Not sounded so good that I tried Retro Wave, Trance, DnB, Metal, etc and all of them performed past my expectations along with my personal settings for poweramp.","[]","B01G8JO5F2","B01G8JO5F2","AGLATIZMUIZKVZDMONMWHZQGWCGQ","2017-04-03 06:58:58.000","4","True","510"

Thanks to its SSD, it boots Windows 10 pretty fast, bloatware is kept to a minimum (please uninstall Norton before doing anything else. :p), and the machine is definitely zippy. Haven't added more RAM nor extra HDD but planning to do so (and update the &#34;review&#34; when I do). Battery life is touted at 12 hours and I pretty much doubt it will reach that milestone (unless you are using the screen at 30% or less maybe) but it does give you at least 6 to 7 hours using it for browsing, writing, etc. Oh, and the Nvidia card is plenty capable for gaming at medium settings at least (Grid Autosport FPS avg is in the 80s/90s or so)\\n\\nInitial assessment:\\n\\n+ Great and fast CPU and overall fast PC performance\\n+ Backlight KB and travel feels pretty nice on the keys.\\n+ Decent quantity of available ports\\n+ It has a DVD drive :o\\n+ Upgrade possibilities\\n+ Decent Full HD screen (might be the 'crappiest' thing on it and it is still good for the price)\\n\\n- Trackpad is too finicky and not my favorite\\n- IT RUNS HOT!!!!!\\n\\nThat is the major con for me. Running GRID benchmark, it got to a high 92/93 degrees C!!!

I guess we could probably undervolt (will look into that) or see if one of those rest 'things' with fans could help. (Do note that this is at room temp 60-something Fahrenheit.

"669747","3","Compact and simple, but current (newer) model will not work with an external portable speaker!","There are currently three different companies selling this little radio under three different names - same radio, other than the front cover's color: gold, black, or silver; you can likely see all 3 on this very page, above, in the alternative offerings. \\nI really liked the first one of these that I got, gold cover, last summer.  Since then, they have &#34;improved&#34; it - changing the charging plug and some other things - and two characteristics of it that to me are quite essential, have been removed from it. \\nOne change, is that with the newer model you cannot connect it to an external speaker.  Earbuds, yes -- mini-speaker with the very same plug-in as the ear buds?  No.  I don't even know how they can make this not possible since the plug is the same, but I've purchased two more since last summer, for me and for a friend, and both are unable to broadcast through a speaker. So unless both are faulty, it's a change they've made. This means, of course, that this is ONLY an 'in-ear' system.  No setting it out on your desk with a little speaker broadcasting into the room.  SUCH a shame! \\nAlso, the new ones do NOT turn off automatically after 90 minutes of straight playing without any adjustment.  This may be nothing to some, but it is nice to be able, for example, to use them for drifting off to sleep with music in the background, which you could do, but now it stays on all night and then needs recharging in the morning.\\nLastly, their attractiveness in being so light and cheap carries the downside of their NOT being very sturdy or reliable for more than a few months (in my experience thus far).  The first one that I bought suddenly stopped allowing programmed channels.  Oddly, every time I attempt to program a channel now, it not only will not accept the programmed station, but now, if I attempt to do it, a large &#34;NO&#34; appears on the screen!  Weird.\\nSo, as long as you understand that this is an earbuds only and quite delicate little item that will  likely not last nearly as long as something costing a little more, then you may enjoy it's extreme lightness, simplicity, and excellent reception throughout its likely limited life span.","[]","B019BYBR48","B07P9QZPGR","AEX33ED5XZQU4JIIGWVXT2JIIWJA","2017-12-11 10:15:30.275","2","True","510"

I didn't try out the 3.5&#34; cages but I would expect much of the same.\\nThe feet do have some rubber on the bottom of them.\\nCONs:\\nThe circle LEDs in the included fans are not bright at all. You will need to buy more lighting.\\nPunch out slots for expansion. Really? At $70 I'm not sure what to think of this.\\nFinal thoughts, rambling:\\nReally, that's what it comes down to. I'm not 100% sure that this case is worth $70. I like it a lot, but what you see is what you get and you don't get much else.\\nIn the end, though, this case fit my needs perfectly and I don't think I would have been happy with any other. If you are going with an ATX board and want to keep a 5.25&#34; drive, I would say that this is the best case you could buy. For those doing without that drive, I don't think this case was made with you in mind, nor do I think that this case would be worth your money.\\n[EDIT]\\nSo I'm not sure how Apevia got this wrong, but the holes on the front grill DON'T fit 140mm fans as advertised. The holes would fit if the mounts were 140mm apart from each other, but only the fan size is 140mm in diameter. The mounts are closer to 110mm apart.

"596319","5","Works great - easy to start, quiet - just what was needed.  Poorly packaged for shipping, though.","This is perfect for my dad's O2 concentrator, in the event of a power outage lasting longer than his O2 backup bottles can hold him.  It is not light weight, but &#60;50lbs, so my stepmom can move it in an emergency.  It is also VERY easy to start.  It's also insanely quiet - on economy mode, you can have a conversation, at normal volume, standing right next to it,  Even in full power mode, it's not that noisy.  One of the things I was most impressed with - nobody wants to listen to a generator running through the night when they are trying to sleep. I'm currently running it through the break-in cycle, using a magnetic dipstick to collect any filings, etc., that come out of the engine during the break-in process.  I was able to successfully run an 1800-watt heat gun, and a box fan with no problems.  It did stumble a bit when I first turned on the heat gun, but it does catch up quickly and provides enough power to run it.  Any small appliance should do well on this - it would power a full-size refrigerator or freezer easily.  Easy to set up, start up, and run. I like the fact that you can shut off the fuel and keep that out of the carburetor.  I use Stabil in all my power equipment and try to use ethanol-free fuel when possible. It makes them much less problematic.  And this unit appears to be very fuel-efficient - esp. with the economy mode running.  Updated:  Pay attention to the bottom of the unit if you order one, once it arrives.  My first one was busted during shipping.  It's evident that the manufacturer didn't really plan on these being shipped via UPS, etc.,  Packaged fine for palletized shipping or gentle handling.  But the cardboard and tape are cheap; the staples pulled out of both of the boxes (the original one I am returning, and the replacement box), and there is some foam padding in the top, but the bottom foam and sides are very thin.  My original order was dropped and landed on something - punched a big hole in the bottom of the housing that allowed the generator to drop inside of the case.  The 2nd one arrived intact, even though the box was almost destroyed.  Staples out, tape busted - the nylon strapping is all that was holding it together.","[]","B00SMNLF4M","B0BGMZZMZN","AHZQJHBQDMFJ4YGZFJYGQKSMQHVQ","2017-03-28 15:27:05.000","6","True","510"
"388656","4","Battery Not Charging Solved","Fixed No Charging Issue.\\nBought this about a year ago with a new iPad Air2.  My son has broke a couple screens, so I was looking at a way to protect this screen as it's more expensive than the older ones that just need a digitizer (touch glass).  You need to purchase a new screen in most cases.  So I figured this would protect it when not in use and also serve as a keyboard and a prop when watching videos.  It has worked great for all of that.  Even though it hasn't charged for the last 9 months or so, he has used it for protecting it in his bag when he takes it places.  I did try contacting Zagg by email when it wouldn't charge.  They didn't respond.  Which is what others said when I was trying to read up on this problem.  So today it was raining out and the keyboard was sitting on the kitchen counter and I felt like taking it apart.  Very easy to take apart.  The rubber edge will peel back and you can find the seam where the bottom fastens.  I used a plastic pry tool starting in the top corner.  Just run the tool along the edge once you find a spot to get it separated.  It will pop the latches and will come off in short order.  Don't be afraid of hurting anything.  There isn't much to worry about except maybe the charging jack.  But that isn't a problem.  When I removed the back I was excited.  The cable to the battery wasn't connected.  It was a couple inches from where it should have been.  Used a small phillips screwdriver to remove the board that battery connects to.  Got it attached and the keyboard works now.  Added some new adhesive to the bottom of battery and added some tape to the top of the battery and to the battery wires so that connection shouldn't come loose as easily.  Snapping the bottom back on was harder than removing it, one spot didn't want to snap back in, but I used my pry tool again and worked it together and looks and works like new again.  So in summary, I think this is a great case for protecting the iPad Air2 screen for transporting.  It is great for typing on according to my 10 year old.  But don't depend on Zagg to fix it for you.  Hope someone else is able to get their keyboard working again.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kqr7x3rKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kqr7x3rKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kqr7x3rKL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zyW-Xd42L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zyW-Xd42L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zyW-Xd42L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00P7TQQZM","B01DBEFRU4","AEZZCN475XN6IJQFARVZV2MYALTQ","2017-07-22 19:37:55.233","4","True","510"

The rear has a nice solid matte texture, the bezels are a centimeter by my measure, its crazy thin and the base is composed of two solid pieces of metal.\\n\\nOf course, as a budget monitor it will have its shortcomings. For starters, it has no speakers. I personally don't care since i have my own speakers but if you don't, beware you will need to get some or buy another display.\\nSecond, The power cable is incredibly cheap. Perhaps it gets the job done but it feels way too delicate. I would have liked to see a little more reinforcement on the cable especially since it bears the power converter (the power brick that most displays have inside but HP put it on the cable most likely to achieve the impressively thin profile).\\nThird is the general image quality. I personally have zero complaints but in a time where 4K displays exist, some people might want more than 1080p. In addition the monitor is not designed for gaming. I'm no gamer so i cant say if it would work as a gaming display but I do know that gaming monitors usually push more than 60Hz which is what this hardware has.\\nLastly, other reviewers have pointed out there is a slight (~1 mm) gap between the panel itself and the plastic case around it. Perhaps this is nothing to worry about, but it also may be something to worry about down the road. I'm not too concerned but i'd keep an eye on it.\\n\\nAll in all, i recommend this display for people on a budget or college kids looking for an inexpensive monitor.\\n\\n**Update - Over a year later-  Zero issues, still the way it was when i bought it. I did notice on one occurrence an ant crawling BEHIND the display. As in, i could see the ant crawling across the screen but i couldn't touch it because it was on the other side of the screen. This was no doubt due to the tiny gap between the display and the frame. Not sure if the ant could do any damage, it only happened once, but it is concerning. I would still recommend the display even at the raised price ($121.41 at time of this update).","[]","B01F6V6SSK","B01F6V6SSK","AEPNBGXEKZMVXSJCIS4SZT4EGUFA","2017-06-28 02:56:13.465","2","True","510"

I have had a lot of fun using it, as I am doing now.\\n\\nSo why only three stars?\\nI had a small problem with one of the built in apps (Coolsense) that I wanted to use. When I tried to get it to run I got an error message that it could not be installed and I should uninstall it and reinstall it. Since I couldn't find the app to reinstall I called Customer Support as I have only had it just over a week and it is under warranty.\\n\\nUh oh, a BIG uh oh!!! HP customer support could not find either the Serial Number or the product number in their database??!! They went ahead and helped me with the problem app and said they would send me info about how to send my receipt to them so it could be researched and registered.  At that point all seemed good. Unfortunately, the next day when I turned the computer on it  would not complete booting and repeatedly said I needed to restart it. I called HP back and was once again told that the Serial Number and Product number were not in their database. They did provide support, but only after calling in two managers who were also confused by the Serial Number/product number problem. After several hours on the phone and several more hours of running tests I had to reset the computer back to factory set-up, which caused all loaded software to be deleted (my data was okay).\\n\\nAfter all of this It seems the computer, itself, is running very well. Now I am waiting to hear from HP as to where to send my receipt so that I can get it registered under my name and get an extended warranty.\\n\\nWHEW!\\n\\nI will update this review when the issue is resolved with HP and let you know what happened.\\n\\nUPDATE : HP completely resolved the issue. It turns out that refurbished computers have two model numbers. Everything is the same except the the last letters on the model number. Mine are AAR I don't know what the correct letters are, but HP found them. Also, I texted the seller and they said they would send the correct model number as well. In the end I was able to get the extended warranty from HP which includes accidents as well as all software and hardware issues.

At times right clicking to pull up sub-menus lags for a second. As well as pressing start menu. (others hint it may involve the Nvidia GPU, but games themselves do not experience such lag)\\n\\nI ordered the laptop without the performance hard drive as I was going to install my own into the laptop. The laptop came without the caddy/mount to install the hard drive in.\\n\\nFor me, the lit keyboard seems dimmer than some competitors (users may vary)\\n\\nTo wrap up, this laptop for approximately $1,049.00 is not necessarily a steal, but a great purchase if you're looking to balance gaming on the go, and writing that 2000 word essay 5 minutes before its due. It's not too heavy or clunky but definitely packs a mean punch. I did come across a few hiccups (regarding the missing hard drive caddy/mount) but if you would contact customer service through Acer's website, they'll send you the necessary items for your hard drive. They were helpful but could've included a tracking number as they only gave me an estimated time to ship (7-10 business days), not including the time it takes to get to me.\\n\\nI would recommend a friend or a stranger to get a hold of this system.","[]","B06Y4GZS9C","B07KML89F3","AGXVVKZTY2ALIZ6OFLLZYMCFMNSA","2017-11-15 15:57:50.510","4","True","510"
"42396","5","Quality Exceeds Price","Well, what a pleasant surprise this stereo turned out to be! My 30 year old shop radio finally died and I needed a replacement with at least FM radio and a CD player. The cost of decent modern stereos spooked me in that I'm not placing a $400 stereo in the sawdust and paint overspray of my shop (I make custom guitars) and I wanted to avoid the yard and garage sale circuit, where I'd bought my previous shop stereo. I took a chance on this unit, have used it a couple weeks now, and I am thoroughly pleased with it.\\n\\nPRO:\\n\\nPretty good sound for a 30' x 30' shop. Not tinny. Adjustable treble/bass/balance.\\nThe CD player works fine, including my self-burned CDs from 15 years ago.\\nThe Bluetooth works fine.\\nThe direct hookup for iPhone/iPad, etc., works fine.\\nThe FM radio station preset process worked fine.\\nShipped fast with zero damage.\\n\\nCON (mostly minor)\\n\\nThe blue light displays - two volume graphs on left and the op window on right - are really bright, possibly due to the Bluetooth function. With the lights turned out in my 30' x 30' shop, the blue light is bright enough to walk around and even work by if within 10' of them. Here in rural North Carolina, snipers are a real problem, so I taped a couple cardboard flaps to cover the bright blue lights with when the sun goes down.\\n\\nThe speakers that came with my unit are all black cloth covered in front, no woofer/tweeters exposed as in the above photos. Matters nothing to me, but it might to you.\\n\\nOnly serious negative was that I lost access to two favored radio stations because the antennae on this unit is apparently less effective than the one on my now defunct old system. Everything about the one I received says 'quality exceeding price'. If you're bargain hunting, look no more.\\n\\nREC:\\n\\nIf you want a decent low cost stereo system for an average or smaller room/shop/office, this one will serve you well. (Please note I cannot speak to its longevity as I've only had it a few weeks.For all I know it might blow up next week).","[]","B00H34GFL4","B07F3XMG74","AGJ7YK7I7CZEJMXWV6KST4YNNFJQ","2017-04-30 19:43:12.000","1","True","510"
"990046","5","Outstanding Sling Bag","This bag is very similar to the outstanding Think Tank TurnStyle 10 sling bag. I needed a lightweight, comfortable bag for the smallish Micro Four-thirds Olympus/Panasonic system for use while hiking, riding bikes, motor cycles, horseback, etc. The TurnStyle 10 fills those needs well and is often used as a general bag. The bag only weighs 1 pound, is super comfortable - which are big pluses. Yet there are two things I would have liked in the design – a way to carry a water bottle and a way to carry a tripod, monopod, or light stand/umbrella.\\n\\nThe MindShift Gear PhotoCross 10 bag includes more water resistant materials and zippers and the means to carry a water bottle and strap on items one may wish to take with them. The front and bottom of the bag is a tough waterproof material so I have no concern about setting the bag down in water or mud. At 2 lbs. it is twice as heavy as the Turn Style 10 but is just as comfortable, if it not more so, to wear all day. These sling bags are the lightest, best, and most useful sling bags of the dozen I have tried over the years.\\n\\nNear the same size as the TurnStyle 10 I can pack more items in the bag. Currently in the bag I have: an Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II camera, an Olympus 12-40mm f/2.8 lens, 42.5mm f/1.2, 7-14mm f/4.0, 35-100mm f/2.8, 100-400mm f/4.0-6.3 Panasonic lenses in the large compartment. The Olympus FL50-R and FL-600R flash units, spare batteries and other small accessories in the front pocket and mesh pockets at the top of the main compartment – all which weigh in at 12 lbs. And there is still room for a 10” tablet. On the outside I have a 20oz. water bottle and a travel sized tripod attached.\\n\\nGrab/carry Handles at the top and on a side of the bag are very welcome. Unique to this sling bag is a load-lifter strap on the shoulder strap and another on the waist belt. These allow you to fine tune how the bag rest against your body and they make significant difference in comfort.\\n\\nHighly Recommend for the outdoor adventurer!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716axdh8piL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716axdh8piL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716axdh8piL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QfCpiU8AL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QfCpiU8AL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QfCpiU8AL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B074HLR84K","B074HLR84K","AF5J4SQMSE7XLRVXBE46YWA7P7FQ","2017-11-19 23:46:11.156","17","True","510"
"121114","1","Not impressed at all","I have a lot of complaints about this new series of Passport Ultra drives and after using dozens of the previous generation and then switching to this one, I am not impressed and in general I believe that the previous generation was better.\\n\\n1) The cables that come with these new passports are garbage.  I have had 2 fail out of 4 drives and ended up replacing them with OLD cables from my original USB 3.0 passport ultras which are still working well after years of abuse.  Clearly the cables are garbage if I had 2 failures out of 4 and this does not bode well for the product line in general.\\n\\n2) Some people seem to indicate that these are faster than the previous generation.  I disagree.  Best case, they are equal, but more often than not I am finding that they are slightly slower - I can not quantify this at this time other than to say that backup time for the same number of files of the same size has increased by at least 10% with these drives which seems to indicate a 10% reduction in overall write speed.  These definitely get warmer than the older drives - Maybe they are heating up and throttling back?\\n\\n3) This is probably my biggest complaint:  Nearly ALL of these drives emit a LOUD whistle, it is VERY high pitched and is difficult for some people to hear.  It seems to very based on what type of surface the drive is set on.  The crazy thing is that if I set these drives just right on my desk surface, one of them will literally start to make my ears ring after 15 minutes or so - It really surprises me that WD mechanical engineers overlooked this - I believe it is due to how cheaply made the housing is.\\n\\n4) The housing is nothing but a downgrade from the previous generation.  Junky feeling plastic with an odd design that seems to serve no purpose other than to add sharp edges (previous generation was rounded and pleasing to the touch) and to add some weird surface texture which resembles... nothing that I find to be pleasing nor interesting.  I suppose I could look on the bright side and say that this new generation would work better as a weapon than the previous generation due to the sharp edges :-P\\n\\nThis generation of WD drives has driven me to re-evaluate my long ago departure from the seagate brand - It is clearly time to give seagate another look.","[]","B01LQQH85G","B089PMMT1X","AGBHGY5FZE3SYMFXMSUSJKZHXMAA","2017-02-02 04:04:22.000","46","True","510"
"504999","3","Not bad case..could be a LOT better!!","This is not a bad product but has a lot of issues but I will hit on the main ones:\\n\\nThe keyboard removes from the case via magnets. However, they aren't very strong so if you close the case on the keyboard they always want to separate. To the point that I had to buy a separate case just to carry both of these in to keep them together. They need either a stronger magnet or an option to keep them together.\\n\\n2nd: I HATE THE LAYOUT OF THE KEYBOARD!! The biggest issue is the layout of the arrow keys. The arrows are pushed up and where your finger would typically go to touch the shift key (on the right side) is now an arrow so I constantly have to stop and cycle back because pushing the up key on this keyboard pushes your cursor to the beginning of the sentence. I absolutely HATE this. I have tons of Razer products. In fact I am writing this review on a Razer keyboard with no issues whatsoever. I absolutely HATE HATE HATE that setup however.\\n\\nThe keyboard besides that is rather nice. The case feels solid. I don't mind and actually prefer the kickstand. My wife has an ipad pro with the pull apart feature too (the Zagg case) and if she pulls the case off the keyboard it doesn't sit up. I have found that I like this function on the Razer case. The kickstand is firm and holds in place..while daunting to push back flush with the case..but if you use two hands (or fingers) on the bottom it will go flush every time.\\n\\n3rd and final issue: The keyboard shuts off after only a few minutes of non-usage so if I am reviewing a document that is long it will turn itself off and then I have to go through the motion of turning it back on. I don't like that feature (my old iPad had a bluetooth case that powered itself back on if you started typing...\\n\\nAlso, if you restart your iPad, at least with my pro model, I have to go back into the bluetooth settings and manually connect it every time...this is annoying!!\\n\\nSo buy at your own risk. There are a lot of issues as you can read from the reviews. But it isn't a bad case by any means..just for $170 it should fix some of these.","[]","B01IA9FRNC","B01IA9FRNC","AHEYPGCYD3EMX64B5L4XSS5S4BQQ","2017-03-17 15:42:27.000","3","True","510"
"516422","4","Dual unit was annoying for me, but overall satisfied.","I returned the two-bud unit. The problems I had with them may not be applicable to others but here is my story:\\n\\nThe units come with a  wide variety of ear buds to get the proper fit. While I could find a suitable one for the right ear, I had to constantly work with the left ear bud. I eventually settled on the &#34;squeezable foam&#34; bud for my left ear. It worked well enough but made the bud stick too far out of my ear, which was a problem if I used my phone on that ear. The left bud was flush with my ear so was comfortable when using a phone.\\n\\nHowever, when I wore both buds, I could not get over the &#34;plugged up&#34; sensation. It was as if I plugged both my ears up with my fingers. I could hear my heart beat, could hear myself breathing, walking, and chewing. One really annoying aspect was that, when I spoke, I could hear my voice both through the bud as well as through my &#34;plugged up&#34; ears (this is sort of hard to describe but imagine plugging both your ears with your fingers, then talking). I have a slight speech stammer and that feedback exacerbated my speech issues. However, despite the plugged up sensation, I could hear conversations and other high pitched noises that I've missed for years.\\n\\nOne annoyance: These do not have the intelligence to filter out unwanted noise such as the car or home air condition. They seem to amplify everything, including noises you don't really need to hear.\\n\\nOn a positive note, if I wore on one single bud, I could hear the stuff I've been missing without the plugged up feeling: The sound of my water fountain, birds chirping, and my wife from the other room. I did not get a chance to test if at a crowded restaurant before returning these but I imagine it would have worked nicely.\\n\\nSo I am returning the two-bud unit and am exploring other options. I really wanted a bluetooth-enabled unit and am researching my options. If I cannot find a suitable bluetooth model, I'll probably purchase the single-bud unit and be as happy as I can be without spending $5,000 on the &#34;real&#34; aids.","[]","B00H9IZ5TC","B00H9IZ5TC","AHBBLZPIY2MKAROEOVFT5THSDGKA","2017-09-11 15:26:28.503","3","True","510"
"973996","3","OK for the price, but needs some tweaking out of the box.","I was looking for a stereo headset with a microphone, to use for calls on both my cell and PC (through Google Voice). I started having issues with the wired set I have, and came across this low-cost headset. I saw reviews on variations of this Bluedio H series Turbine, and they ranged from great Bluetooth to too much bass... to sounds great. These are $30 wireless headphones, so I expected &#34;OK&#34; music reproduction.\\n. First off, these headphones have boost in the lower midrange and upper bass that is pleasant for voice (i.e. - podcasts and phone calls). Music did tend to be heavy on the bass, to the point the sound was muddied... until I disabled the bass enhancement on the computer's equalizer for the Bluedio. After that, the high end seemed nicely enhanced while the low end was reasonably tapered.  Using the wire to connect directly to the PC is more pleasant for music listening. That bypasses the wireless circuit, so take it for what it's worth.\\n. The microphone has its limitations. There is no boom to get close proximity to one's mouth. With it up next to the ear, it picks up a lot of room noise. It is also half-duplex, so ambient noises can easily override the voice on the other end of a phone call. The best performance I got was sitting at my desk. The computer screen makes a great sound reflector. I also needed to tip the headband from the top of my head to the back to get a better point to the screen. I got mixed reviews from callers to whether I sounded good or bad. Usually worse when walking around in a noisy environment.\\n. Dual pairing is both cool and annoying. I paired the Bluedio to both my phone and laptop. I will lose the audio link to the laptop, if I get an audible alert on the phone.\\n. FM Radio... Yes, I use that! I had to disconnect from my paired devices before I could get to the radio. A few steps, but not bad.\\n. Memory slot... I haven't used this function, yet. All my music is on my devices. With a GUI to select and play music sets, that is my preference. Without an EQ on the headset I am guessing that I might have an issue with the bass. Plus, I would not use a full ear headphone out in traffic.","[]","B00M6NP9AU","B00VIKYN8Q","AHCZJNY4F5TJVKZNQVF45PMFZYVQ","2017-01-28 20:19:58.000","0","True","510"

I graduated from Forerunner 205 and 305, which I loved.\\n\\nThere are several things I love more about the 230:\\n1. It seems to pick up GPS signal much faster than 205/305\\n2. The battery life is incredible. It will last for weeks even if I wear the 230 like a regular watch, then go run, etc.\\n3. If you take a break in the middle of your run for a drink, bathroom break, etc, it will stop the time which is used to calculate pace, but the overall time is still tracked. So when my wife and I go run separately, we will say let's run for 1 hour, and even if I stop by 5 minutes, I can still track the over all time, and it won't affect the calculation of my average pace.\\n4. After each mile, there is a notification which tells you how fast you ran the past mile, which is kinda nice.\\n5. Physically, it is a much more attractive watch so I can wear it casually as a primary watch\\n5. Large screen, so that the numbers are much easier to see in all circumstances. It's important as I get older and have poorer vision.\\n6. Much lighter in weight than the 205/305\\n\\nBUT, here are things I do not like:\\n1. Every time I put on my pants as I tuck my shirt in, the buttons are pressed accidentally. It happens quite often, so if you are wearing it like a regular watch, you just have to get it back on to the main screen frequently. It's a bit annoying\\n2. The screen on the watch is pretty weak. Like some others, my screen cracked. I think it happened when I put the watch in my pocket while I was cooking dinner. I have no idea how it cracked, but it did. This is the major reason for one star deduction. I would have given it a 5 stars, if the screen wasn't so frail.\\n\\nOver all I love the watch.

I unfortunately stepped on my first one, and while the screen didn't crack, something inside the screen did, because there were enough blank lines across it that I couldn't read! I immediately ordered the newest generation of [[ASIN:B017JG41PC Kindle E-reader - White, 6&#34; Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers]] ... and requested a return as soon as I charged it up. Most Kindle reviews concentrate on the hardware - size, weight, looks, ect. So the horrific new home page and incredibly sucky library list (apparently designed to limit access to books you've bought elsewhere) were a complete surprise. They show a lot of books by the cover. This type of screen is WAY too small and grey to interpret cover art and make out the title!!!!\\nSo why did I knock off a star? The refurbishing does not include the software updates that happened several years ago. Fortunately I'm very good at googling for answers, and found a blog post about a security update that if you missed it, won't let you connect to the internet. In my case, I seemed to be connected, as per the icon and the settings, but when I tried to register my device, it said I was not connected. I thought I was going to have to return another one! Grrr. When I followed the link on the blog to the Amazon updates page, I found out that I was not just one update behind, but two. Then I had to figure out &#34;drag and drop the file to the Kindle drive&#34;. Well, I finally did ... once you know how, it updates very quickly, adds a notice to your homescreen that the update happened, and I saw that I was automatically registered. All my purchased books were in the Archived link, but downloaded as soon as I opened them. Then, I transferred my non-Amazon books over, and YAY!!! Bonus for being able to read the .mobi format; for the new Kindle, I had to convert to .azw3 (not a big deal, but one less step before getting to read is always nice). It didn't sych up the page in the book I was reading on the other Kindle, but for all the benefits, paging through 53% of the book was no big deal.

"479013","5","Big player for small pockets...","Since I purchased my unit,  it's price dropped out of the sky,  for little over $250 as I have seen a few days ago,  there's absolutely no reason not to recommend it. It comes with few accessories; charging cable,  manual and two screen protectors. The body of the unit feels sturdy and durable, the plastic back cover though makes it feel cheap,  kind of eccentric in appearance.  The ultra - portable small form factor is sweet, reading the specs makes one wonder,  how they managed to cram all the components in such a tiny box...The small touch screen works well with the sleek,  slim and snappy interface,  complimented by well placed physical buttons to make the player functional and practical from every aspect. The user interface includes a shortcut to raise the volume when the player serves as audio component,  via headphone jacks as line out. The 2.5 mm TRRS balanced port offers some minute enhancements compared to the single ended heaphone port,  and far better signal strength,  as expected.  I'm using the active ground control option from the balanced port,  I find it slightly better than the &#34;balanced&#34; option,  and never looked back since I started using the TRRS port.  As far as sound performance,  the sound produced is very detailed and analytic, with a natural and neutral tone,  and a tadbit narrow sound stage. I can't comment on the 10 band equalizer,  I never attempted to use it, I'm happy with the natural sound the player offers,  when ALAC, WAV, IAFF files are played. The file transfer rather sluggish, but the reason for that could be my aging micro SD card,  I just simply pulled a 128GB card out of my iBasso DX90,  and transferred it to the brand new,  just unpacked Rubato, and fired it up. It took considerable amount of time for the player to create the database for playlist,  in fact,  I had to disable the &#34;auto sync&#34; feature to prevent it from crashing repeatedly.  The second firmware update was recently released, which appear to resolve other nagging issues I don't have the time and space here to list. Overall,  I find this little gem a very strong performer,  and an addictive toy.  Solid five starts,  and two thumbs up for the Onkyo design team!","[]","B06XGWGLDK","B06XGWGLDK","AHFXNWNXI2WQPZHYLQ3PJO2SVLUQ","2017-10-03 23:13:30.919","15","True","510"
"412110","5","Redesigned to be as beautiful as it is functional.","If you've ever owned a Peak Design Capture Clip, you're going to want this to replace the v1 or v2 version you currently own. if you don't, once you've figured out its purpose and have seen the photos, you'll want this on your bag.\\n\\nMaybe you like the extra weight a DSLR or large mirrorless camera around your neck and how it makes you look like a tourist. Maybe you prefer to sling it over your shoulder so you can worry about every doorframe you might crash it into upon walking through one. If neither sounds like you, this is one of the best ways to carry your camera. Attach the clip to your backpack or messenger bag strap, the ARCA-style adapter plate to your camera's tripod receptacle, and boom... you can now easily carry your camera in a far better position on your person. Hell, you can even attach it to your belt and look like a wild west Ansel Adams.\\n\\nWhile the previous versions are perfectly serviceable, this latest version looks like the designers took Jony Ive 101 at Bay Area Community College. Clean lines with no sharp edges, uniform color and a more reliably grippy back plate and a monochrome palette in two colors: black (aka gray) and white (aka silver). The lower profile thumbscrews take a slight step backward in functionality compared to previous versions but they include high tension hex head screws for a more permanent install, should you choose that route. Also included is a decal, hex key and a nicely constructed, drawstring carry bag.\\n\\nThis is what they &#34;Kickstarted&#34; a month ago for a week so they could be produced and shipped before xmas. Now that we're past the holiday, they are up for sale to the general public.\\n\\nThe Capture Clip v3 continues the run of excellent redesigns Peak Design has been doing this year, following the equally excellent Leash v2, Cuff v2, Slide Lite v2 and Slide v2 all featuring smart changes, efficient design and tasteful color options. Even the ARCA-style adapter plate (sold separately or as a combo package) has been changed, with a lower profile and stronger construction. And just in case you're unsure, all of the previous PD adapter plates work with version 3, no exceptions.\\n\\nBuy it now. You know you need it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-9oZ-qy6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-9oZ-qy6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-9oZ-qy6L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sLMVkweML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sLMVkweML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sLMVkweML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sRWJ9OVxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sRWJ9OVxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sRWJ9OVxL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B07818Z4Q5","B0BZ96MQ7K","AFV2VEDSKXKRS6JB2CGOAMKAJCQQ","2017-12-28 00:40:04.785","4","True","510"
"738631","5","Very good monitor at a very good price. Dimensions are odd leaning to extra wide","No complaints here. Price was very right and performance is very good. One oddity is the width (very wide) to height (not very tall) proportion. It's the  same height as a 24&#34; 1080P monitor. Rotating the monitor to portrait mode (stand included does NOT rotate, I had previously purchased a separate $30 VESA 100MM mount that worked fine), the excessive width, now height once rotated, is very noticeable. That was what I wanted, though it's a little taller than my expectations. I think the size and resolution is very good for my eyes and software development work; Taller 2560 pixels height and decent 1440 pixel width. I would like to go 4K, but I'm still looking for a decent sized 4K monitor since 27&#34; or 28&#34; make everything too small. Colors are good, though I've mostly looked at colored text with limited web browsing thrown in. It is an IPS panel, so colors are good. There was limited/minor light bleed in the corners and was only noticeable on completely dark/black backgrounds that covered the screen; i.e. when I was testing for dead pixels with dead pixel buddy. The one I received had no dead or stuck pixels. The unit has 1/2&#34; black glossy (wish they were matte since they can reflect bright screen content at the edges) bezels all around and bottom has a nice brushed metal look (plastic) bezel cover; it makes the monitor look more expensive. The bottom bezel has a feature sticker that is difficult to remove. The sticker will come off, but the glue remains and is very difficult to remove; was concerned that typical chemicals would damage the plastic or metal look. After much careful work it eventually all came off and no damage. On screen menus for settings are OK, but not great. The OSD controls use real push buttons rather than static touch controls; the latter often fail or work erratically. Port selection is very good, but only one of almost everything; VGA, DVI, HDMI, and DisplayPort but not USB-C. No USB hub at all is built in. The power supply is built in, so just a power cord from wall to monitor bottom; I really prefer that until it breaks that is. So far, the unit has worked well and met and even exceeded my expectations. For the price, it's very good monitor for a larger 1440P display.","[]","B01N2FZTZH","B01N2FZTZH","AEF6Q5DGUURDDYVIPVQ7TDMLDQ6A","2017-10-03 18:23:04.490","0","True","510"
"604548","4","Great Canon EF 24-105mm lens replica cup!  Made a great gift for a photographer friend!","I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine who is a photographer and I happen to know that he shoots with Canon equipment, so I thought he'd get a kick out of this lens cup/thermos and indeed he did!  Keep in mind this isn't going to hold as much liquid as a traditional thermos would.  I measured with a measuring cup and it holds just over a cup and a half (or about 12.9 ounces).  Most bottled water is around 16.9 ounces to give you some perspective.  This cup would hold a full can of soda though.  Here's what I love about it:\\n\\n- ACCURATE:  Unlike some other similar products, this lens cup really does a great job at looking like a Canon EF 24-105mm lens, right down to the lid.  It's modeled to the the exact size as well.\\n- INSULATED:  The interior is stainless steel to keep hot beverages hot and cold beverages cold.\\n- SCREW ON LID:  I like that the lid screws on instead of just pushes on like some other similar cups.\\n- FITS:  This cup fit really well in the cup holder of my Mazda CX-5.\\n- VERSATILE:  Yes this is a cup and is meant to be drunk out of, but you could also use it on a desk as a pen holder, put flowers or a little plant in it or whatever else you can think of!\\n- FUN:  This is a really great conversation piece and makes a great gift for a photographer\\n\\nWhile it's designed to be as close to the shape and size of a real lens as possible and I appreciate that, it doesn't necessarily make for the best cup experience.  While it's great for a car cup holder, the smaller base makes it more prone to tipping or being accidentally knocked over if it's sitting on a table or desk so be aware of that.  Also, I tend to like to be able to put more than 12 oz in a cup like this for my own morning breakfast drink, but this is more of a show piece than the finest cup ever made.\\n\\nThat being said, I really like it and so did my friend.  Great gift, looks awesome!  For the record I did NOT receive this product for free or at a discount.  Hope this helps!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BJGcVYtYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BJGcVYtYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BJGcVYtYL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ul4QFL2LL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ul4QFL2LL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ul4QFL2LL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Upk0lt5BL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Upk0lt5BL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Upk0lt5BL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ecIgKKUVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ecIgKKUVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ecIgKKUVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hj8joS7hL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hj8joS7hL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hj8joS7hL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sEHBjAigL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sEHBjAigL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sEHBjAigL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817TiqOu1OL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817TiqOu1OL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817TiqOu1OL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EcNltpakL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EcNltpakL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EcNltpakL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81u8y90k8SL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81u8y90k8SL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81u8y90k8SL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B008BBNNE0","B008BBNNE0","AE4SBEJSCJAWM7CRKJDBQF3O7RGA","2017-03-16 17:41:56.000","1","True","510"
"194679","5","Exceeds expectations","I normally give 3 stars to indicate a product met my expectation but this product works better than I'd hoped.  I was getting tired of manually moving my monitor cables between my home PC and my work docking station so I plugged everything into this KVM.  I am pleased at how easily everything went together.  I am thrilled that the sound system follows the active computer.  And I am especially impressed that I can plug my printer's USB cable into the KVM and that printer is available to whichever computer is active on the KVM.  The one touch switch between PCs means that my wife can switch over to our home computer without having to learn a new technology.\\n\\nThe only downside I've experienced is that when I switch between PCs, there is a very loud pop of feedback in my sound system.  I have an extra audio cable for my sound system and there isn't a plug for it on the KVM, and I think I'm getting feedback through this plug which is causing this pop.  So I doubt it is the fault of the KVM.  But the pop is enough to chase my cat from the room! :)\\n\\nOther thoughts: I use a wireless keyboard/mouse combo and the base station is plugged into one of the USB ports on the KVM.  I've read some reviews that said they weren't able to get wireless devices to work with KVMs but I am NOT experiencing any issues with this.  Also, I am using VGA for one of my monitors and DVI for the other.  I picked this KVM because it has one of each.  I considered getting a KVM with two DVI inputs then using a DVI to VGA adapter but I've read that doesn't always work either.  I side stepped that issue and am very pleased with the way this product works!\\n\\nAfter owning this product for two years I'm still thrilled with it. As I recall, it was expensive ... in the $400+ range ... but I wish I'd paid the $600+ to get the 4 port model!\\n\\nIt is -SO- nice to have a KVM that I can use with dual monitors.  I use one port for my home PC and the other for my work laptop's docking station. But if I had the 4 port model I'd be able to switch over to a server and my wife could probably hook up a Mac.","[]","B00310EES0","B07RSGPN7F","AFTPJQZQ7SZYN5RE36H2GWSAM26Q","2017-03-02 13:58:18.000","2","True","510"

Let me say that my wife is a very responsible and considerate person (explains our 30 year marriage). She meticulously care for and respect her property. As a result, her stuff tends to last a long, long, time.\\nIn any event, my wife has an eclectic taste in music. She listens to music to relax, think, and or work on personal projects. That is the reason for this purchase.\\n\\nOn May 15, 2017, I contacted AnkerDirect to notify them about the following issues with this item: dropping of  Bluetooth signal, the cover on the charger port and power button  cracked in two and fell off. I would like this repaired ASAP. One day later, received email from AnkerDirect stating that they would get back to me and they valued my patience. May 24, 2017, recieved second email from AnkerDirect stating that &#34;we have not heard from you&#34; and please evaluate our performance by completing the enclosed survey.\\n\\nVery, very, interesting. I had foolishly assumed that AnkerDirect would honor its 2 year warranty. Let's see, I have seven items that i purchased from AnkerDirect within the last 2 years. This does not bode well for the future.\\n\\nMy wife no longer uses this item for it has multiple design flaws. For example, it does not stay in the ear canal. And, all the control buttons are crammed into a very small space which results in  multiple errors when operating the device.\\n\\nTHANKS ANKERDIRECT YOUR A WONDERFUL, TRUSTWORTHY, AND RELIABLE COMPANY THAT STANDS BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS!\\n\\n***UPDATE***\\nInitial rating for this item was 2 stars. But, I now rate it @ 3 stars. Anker customer service is phenomenal. They are  sending me a replacement for this item free of charge. There was some miscommunication with our email correspondence which has been resolved. What a relief, for I have previously  purchased mutiple devices from this company.

I used the chat function to contact support. I got a response to issue one (new phone) fairly quickly.

"144881","3","Ugly and Expensive and Loud","Even though you can buy a laptop for the price of this keyboard, I thought I'd give it a shot as an option for an ergonomic keyboard. Of course, I knew going into it that it's very different and takes getting used to. I gave it about a week of regular use, and you do start to get used to it.\\n\\nPros:\\n- I really like the backspace, space, and arrow keys location. That feels a lot more natural/fast.\\n- Being able to fully customize the keys is useful, but you can achieve similar with Karabiner/Karabiner-Elements (for Mac)\\n- I imagine that for people who have severe issues with carpal tunnel, it may be a worthwhile investment.\\n\\nCons:\\n- It really is an ugly beast. I was willing to put up with that if it was magically great for ergonomics, though, as I guess most who use it are.\\n- It is LOUD AS H*LL. I guess people who are all about the &#34;mechanical&#34; keyboards are used to this and may even like it, but I felt self-conscious in an open workspace with this thing.\\n- The function keys and, to a lesser degree, the number keys, just don't feel right being &#34;up&#34; above the others. And the inner keys on the bottom row were really challenging to get used to. I am sure over time that it would get more natural, but it just felt wrong.\\n- It may be where I had to use it (physically, i.e., a bit high on the desk at work), but I thought I felt my wrists bothering me more than usual. Given that this is supposed to be ergonomic, I was surprised by that. So YMMV.\\n- Super duper expensive.\\n\\nIn the end, given all the cons above, I decided to return it. I am instead using the Microsoft Sculpt Egonomic keyboard, which both looks lovely and functions well--I feel it's functionally ergonomic, and I find I type faster than with the standard Apple keyboards. I use Karabiner-Elements to remap a few things, and I'm all set. As a software developer who almost lives on my keyboard, I can recommend that one instead.","[]","B01KBKFXQY","B07C13QC1V","AHNAWK4SVOPFQPKGUIRHGOJG74LQ","2017-04-01 19:51:35.000","1","True","510"
"952907","1","This is about a DEFECTIVE RADIO!  I'd give this less than one Star if I could!","Initially I bought a SOFITEC shortwave receiver a cheapo model and received shortwave in the evening.  I live in a cement block house in the Philippines and supposedly this cuts down on the shortwave signal.  Well I was able to tune in various stations with this one.  Then I decided to buy the Eton Grundig Satellit 750 with the Sangean Ant-60 antenna (Cost $296.99 plus $9.94 for the antenna with Customs and VAT for a total of $558.59).  Ever since I was a young child I wanted a decent/expensive shortwave receiver and the picture of this one looked good.  Well I ordered it 13 Jan. 2017 and received it yesterday 23 Jan. 2017; and turned it on anticipating hearing clear shortwave signals, and only got static!  I looked up the GMT/UTC time and a frequency list online and then plugged in several frequencies only to receive NOTHING!  It is very disheartening for me as this was a huge expense and I can only guess that the radio is defective.  I am new at Shortwave listening and I have tried looking up information on how I could tell if this radio is defective but searches have been useless!  I contacted the company to register and took the opportunity to ask this question of them; I have not received a answer yet but it has only been one day.  Just to add a bit here.  I spent a lot of time looking up shortwave radios and reviews, I watched youtube videos etc...  So I was fairly confident when I bought this radio that it would work.  Like I said, the fact that it does not receive shortwave is a very large disappointment to me.  The radio is advertised as being able to receive these broadcasts!  I am editing this.  I thought I would lose money if I sent it back for a refund, Amazon says they will take it back and it will cost me $20.00 but I will get most of my money back.  I'm still unsure but have to take the chance of returning it with the hope of getting most of my money back.  Even so, I do not trust Eton Grundig anymore!  Buyer beware!\\n*** Initially I used the built in whip antenna that comes with the set.  Today I put the Sangean antenna outside and attached it to the radio with the clip.

"930515","3","Worked well until they didn't","I got these in early February, used them every day, often until they'd run out of battery. They'd probably see the gym five times a week (physically a great design for cycling/jogging/lifting).  Then in late May (so about four months after purchase), they started acting differently. Sound quality remained fine, but they &#34;menu&#34; suddenly changed from the English lady saying &#34;dis/connected&#34; to a series of beeps.  That's fine...I don't know what changed it...but it didn't affect functionality...just weirded me out...I tried a reset and it still seemed to want to do that.  Anyways they kept working fine otherwise, and then they started having battery issues, which seemed to stem from the thing's inability to turn off. They'd just die really early even though I had fully charged them. I tried another reset, and no difference.  All the other functionality worked, however.  Finally yesterday they just stopped working/charging.  I'm pretty disappointed since these were/are very nice headphones in terms of the ear-mounting, overall quality, mass, and sound quality, but for $35.00 I was expecting to get more than 4.5 months of service out of the pair.  If I get time I'll probably open these up to see where they failed at. I do not treat my electronics poorly so I'm guessing this is either a battery issue, switch issue, or some hardware failure, although the sudden firmware/menu change also has me guessing.\\n\\nSo 3 stars...these are good headphones when they worked properly and if they hadn't failed I'd be super happy to have continued using them. If they were ten bucks cheaper, I'd actually probably consider just getting a fresh pair in spite of this failing,  but at their current price I'll probably try another pair and see how those go.\\n\\nThe only annoying thing I found about the design is the microUSB charging port they have is very shallow/not standard so if you are trying to charge these with a standard microUSB cable, it will sometimes not stay in, which makes since these plugs have a certain assumed depth to take care of this...without that there's going to be issues.\\n\\nNote I never used the microphone in these since I'm old fashioned and need to hold the phone to my face to feel normal.","[]","B01GDIUA8Y","B01GDIUA8Y","AG46BBUQHQYZOSXZ634FRJIGQG2A","2017-06-19 17:43:52.148","6","True","510"

"581336","5","Setup was easy...","I’ve attached a few pics, nothing to outrageous here, it’s a 4 bay NAS (that can be expanded to 9 drives).  Kind of a light weight feel to it, plastic frame and hard drive housings, but later when it’s loaded with drives the weight savings was appreciated.\\n\\nAlong with drives, I also installed a M2 NVMe drive for cache set up.  Later when setting it up you see that a solo cache SSD maximizes the read speed, to get the best performance for read and write tasks you need to have 2 SSDs for caching.  I’ll need to do some testing and research here.  I’m sure someone else has figured it out already!\\n\\nI unboxed in 2 minutes, mounted drives into the slots took about 5 minutes and booted in 3 minutes (not fully set up but access to the web utility pretty quickly for first boot).\\n\\nYou'll be prompted to create an account and install DiskStation Manager.  SO, after you order, go ahead and download your PDFs and the DS Manager from Synology and have it ready to go.  The DS Manager setup had a 10 minute countdown but on my unit it took 5 minutes.\\n\\nThe admin website interface is a very nice desktop OS like navigation.  You can install apps from Package Center, there is a Control Panel and a File Navigator inside the ‘shell’ to start you off.  But first you’ll go to Storage Manager to set up your drives.\\n\\nI got this more for media storage, so to max use my new drives I went with Raid 5.  It took about 12 hours to run the Parity Consistency check.  But I checked after about 2 hours and at that time I had space available and usable, so I copied a few things over to get started.  This may have been the case from the start.\\n\\nOverall, set up was easy, I’m not a novice but not a super expert.  There were guides and menus along the way to help folks new to setting up a NAS and the Synology boards are very active for research.\\n\\nI’ll add an update later if I have anything significant regarding performance or experience, but so far it does what it says and am happy with the unit.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B7S-IUktL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B7S-IUktL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B7S-IUktL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KEjO40f6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KEjO40f6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KEjO40f6L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71W8J2EgI2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71W8J2EgI2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71W8J2EgI2L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rm56YWoRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rm56YWoRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rm56YWoRL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B075N1Z9LT","B075N1Z9LT","AGSAA4LOIOLLQITO3CONMHVFYIFA","2017-09-29 12:50:53.199","361","True","510"

WATCH OUT.\\n1) The screen is REALLY low resolution, even for a small 4.3&#34; size -- the pixel density is pretty bad, and it's going to look like crap.  A lot of apps aren't going to work well on such a low resolution screen.\\n2) This does NOT have an Apple A4 CPU.  It's a Cortex A8, VERY old and slow these days -- this CPU was released in 2005.  It is now 2017.\\n3) This device has a very old MINI USB port, not the much more common MICRO USB which ha been standard for many years now.  You probably don't have extra mini-USB cables lying around, nor any chargers for that.  You aren't going to be able to share any of that stuff from any of your modern devices.\\n4) Android 4.2????  That's Jelly Bean.  Android has long since moved on -- we're at 7.1.2 now.  Google isn't even patching 4.2 anymore.  Also, 4.2 has a nice long list of known critical security vulnerabilities.  So unless you're only going to be playing music on it, and transferring that music directly from your computer and not from the internet, and you aren't going to be doing ANYTHING on the internet with it whatsoever, especially web browsing, don't even.  Just don't.  It is absolutely IRRESPONSIBLE to be selling devices with such an old OS at this point, especially since... who really thinks that a no-name import like iView is going to *ever* update the OS on this piece of junk, even *if* Google happened to put out any patches (which it isn't)?  That's the problem with these super low cost mass-produced imports.  The vendors are reckless and they NEVER issue any updates.  Never, ever.  Then you, the consumer, get drive-by malware just from opening some website and having it pwned by a malicious ad, and now Android gets a bad reputation for being &#34;vulnerable to malware&#34; because look at all of these infected devices, when most of them are crap like this, being sold in 2017 with a 2013 OS version, and that isn't Google's fault but rather is the fault with the idiot vendor who shouldn't be selling this crap.","[]","B00DJ3YEEI","B00DJ3YEEI","AHLT3AQRJ4S3D44V5UDBFUFQJCXQ","2017-03-17 19:14:38.000","0","False","510"

There are things to take note of, and not negative things,...just things to prepare you for should you purchase this bag. So far they've been all positive for us.\\n\\n1. The bag is super sturdy. big, bulky, strong (it's especially good if you're in big crowds of people...you can knock 'em over with one turn wearing this thing on your back)\\n\\n2. It's got so many dividers for you to customize which section your lenses go in, how big you want that divider to be, etc\\n\\n3. The easy access compartments (the zipper access on the bottm sides of the bag), I can't even begin to describe to you how incredibly handy those zipper access points are. We took a trip to disneyland with 2 moms and 2 kids and this bag came in handy throughout the entire day. We were able to store water bottles, snacks, lenses, the camera, sunscreen...you name it...we stored it in this bag and it was all so easy to retrieve even when the person who's wearing it is walking; you can just zip open a side zipper and are able to grab a drink bottle if you need to.\\n\\n4. There are strips layered over the front of the bag that allow you to purchase add on compartments and attach them to those strips. Big bonus.\\n\\n5. You will get sweaty after wearing the bag for a couple of hours since it's so big and will probably cover up most of your back\\n\\n6. Depending on how much camera gear you have...The 450 version holds A LOT. Keep that in mind for when you're trying to choose between which version you should get. I'm sure the 350 is the perfect size which is why is may be more expensive than the 450 (even though it's smaller). With the 350, you could pack 1 camera and a few lenses and a couple of accessories along with the 13 in laptop. With the 450, I'm sure you can easily fit 2 cameras in there with a good amount of lenses to switch out for each camera.\\n\\nAgain...I haven't found a con yet with this purchase so if you end up going with this bag or the 350, you won't be unhappy.","[]","B00ND21KS8","B00ND21KS8","AFPIVCJDVSQLYACYQSCWXBZQZJXA","2017-09-19 19:06:17.339","0","True","510"
"795440","4","Great fix for the bedroom TV","Eager to install this sound bar so I could silence the hated speakers on my bedroom's Samsung 32-inch TV. The Samsung audio had all the charm of a scratchy boombox heard from two doors down. Simply awful on the ears, even while the HD TV picture remains sweet.\\n\\nThe Sony sound bar was super easy to set up, especially since I had the optical out option on the Samsung. (Cord provided, but none if you need to use the RCA plugs.) The subwoofer just needs a power hookup. Everything turned on right away, and the TV sound came through once I selected &#34;external speaker&#34; on the TV set's menu. The subwoofer synched in seconds and went to work.\\n\\nNothing to rival our 5.1 hookup in the LR, but the upgrade from the Samsung speakers to the Sony sound bar was immediately apparent. Watching &#34;Shark Tank,&#34; the voices sounded natural and full. Switching over to the latest &#34;King Kong&#34; movie, the subwoofer came into play and was, well, better than nothing. The explosions and gunfire had a bit of impact and edge, unlike the tinny mess I'd suffered before. Again, voices were clear even with background sounds, with distinct timbre. No audio fatigue, just pleasant workable sound.\\n\\nI did not find the advertised &#34;virtual surround&#34; all that apparent, but I am used to real surround. The subwoofer does have a volume button on the remote, but there's no indicator of how high the volume is until you max it out, kind of annoying. There are a few compression options to make voices easier to understand at lower-volume listening.\\n\\nBe sure to get the color closest to your TV set's style -- my bar is off white, which looks a bit odd next to the black-on-black TV. There is a 36-page manual and a quick-install guide.\\n\\nThe price seems right for this well-made product. I cannot recommend the sound bar for a main TV set-up -- you'd probably be better off hooking up the TV to a thrift-shop receiver and speakers -- but for a bedroom, kitchen or even a small apartment situation, it's just fine. Happy to own this.","[]","B01MRD7SE0","B06WGRS16N","AEXVEOTM6QUHZK3VUKFTCTAVTG2A","2017-12-05 01:21:52.921","1","False","510"
"105973","5","Works great when used to step down the input voltage for a device with compatible watts &/or amps.","Does its job both up and down, as long as I pay attention to the watts and amps of the device I am connecting it to. I see a lot of people claim it has burned up or blown fuses all the time. If you want to step down a Black & Decker power drill or circular saw, you need a heavier transformer. I use a 500 for my USA power tools and my USA bread machine, food processor, hair dryer, and toaster oven from the USA. I live in Ghana where we have 220-240 V 50 Hz electricity. Remember these power tools use a lot of juice when they start up. That is the point at which you are blowing fuses. Look at the amps and watts listed on the back or bottom of your device. That will tell you how heavy of a transformer you need.\\n&#34;\\nI use this little one to charge my cordless vacs, electric diffusion device for cat calming pheromone, or room deodorizer diffuser (liquid jasmine, vanilla orchid, etc Febreze or AirWick things) and also those children's stuffy nose eucalyptus vapor pad warmers. This also works with those scented oil or wax warmers to scent the bathroom, etc. or with a nightlight. I own 3-4  of these step up/own transformers, of different capacities, depending on the device I am using it with. It is NOT one size fits all. Check your amps and watts!\\n\\nI also keep one in the USA to charge my Ghanaian phone that uses 220 V. I use the step up function and plug the phone charger into the 220 V output socket. Pay attention with that, too, as there are 2 sockets: 1 is output 110 V and the other one is output 220 V. It comes with a USA standard grounded plug and an &#34;adapter&#34; with round prongs  that is useful some places in Europe, but you will need a universal adapter to plug it in to different sockets. There are several good universal socket adapters available. These socket &#34;adapters&#34; do NOT alter voltage output, all they do is change the shape of the plug on the end of your wire, so you can plug your device into a, Italian socket (round prongs) or British (3 heavy prongs) or Australian (prongs at an angle).","[]","B0022TSC5C","B0022TSC5C","AHOFDZ2SASUPURJHF4NTICTLSBPA","2017-02-09 16:35:29.000","0","True","510"
"82850","2","Not a great system","Had this system for a few months.  Bought this system over others due to positive reviews and the fact that it was a wired system.  Did not want to replace batteries in a wireless system every couple of months - I have never had good experiences with batteries with extreme cold and/or damp conditions.  Wiring the system was a bit of a pain but I knew this going into it.  The ends that plug into the camera have no protection (like a protective sleeve) so I wonder how long they will last before they corrode or rust.  I did my best to protect them.  Image quality is quite good as is the night vision.  Was a little disappointed that the red IR LED lights for the night vision were so clearly visible. The camera default was a lower quality, had to make it be HD.  The cameras seem to be sturdy.  Now the bad parts:  The software seems to be overly complicated and difficult to use.  The user manual is quite lengthy (just shy of 200 pages) and not written very well.  Hard to find stuff and understand it.  I just wanted these cameras to detect motion but it is either too sensitive or not enough.  Alarms keep going off when I can see no movement.  Often the sun going in & out (behind clouds) casts enough of a change to trigger a motion alarm.  When it switches from day to night mode, this also triggers an alarm.  When I adjust the sensitivity settings & have someone walk by the camera, they suddenly appear mid frame (on the recording) and jump around.  The recording starts & stops frequently even when the person never stopped walking or never left the frame ( I was watching the live feed so I know what they did). Seems to be no happy medium.  I walked by one camera carrying a ladder and it never picked me up for the motion alarm.  The fan in the DVR unit is very loud. Also tried to access the feed from another computer and was not able to do so until I made all sort of changes to the IP addresses and other settings.  When I did so, could not access the feed locally until I reset the system.  Overall not very happy with this system and too late to return.  Seems like old technology from years ago.  Wish now that I had tried my luck with a wireless system like Arlo or something similar.  Not going to be using this system very long but cannot afford to replace it at this time.","[]","B01BO2KQTW","B01BO2KQTW","AF6CIFS7WG6MB4XXEPU5VJLUGF7Q","2017-07-25 00:36:48.369","1","True","510"
"589765","4","Just what I was looking for","I have a Surface Pro 4 that I'd had it in a small laptop bag before, but it was too big and annoyed me to bring it home every night. Once I started looking for a new case, I came across a wide variety and couldn't choose. I purchased 5 of them and am reviewing them all. I'll send back the ones I don't like.\\n\\nFirst off, this says it is a cross-body bag. What isn't clear is that there are actually 3 loops to clip the strap to. So you could use the diagonal loops and get a cross-body bag. Or use the two on the side for a horizontal hanging bag. I'm not sure that it's designed to be used as a vertical hanging bag, but you can by using the two loops by the handle. That's how I have it set up and it works perfectly.\\n\\nThere are a couple things that I noticed at first but am already getting used to. For one, the zipper was stiff at first and caught on the border of the interior lining. This got better quickly with use. Since there is a handle on top, you unzip the bottom of the bag to access the device. No big deal. Lastly, the accessory pockets don't zip shut. As such, they open from the top, by the handle, not the bottom like the compartment for the device. I haven't seen any part of my charger protruding out so it seems to stay in place without a zipper.\\n\\nDespite these oddities, I'm going to give this one a shot because of the upward strap orientation. It will be my primary case.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\nEdit 5/19/17\\nI'm downgrading this to 4-stars because of one of my initial complaints...the Accessory pouches don't fasten shut. When I only have my charger in one, it doesn't fall out when I hold the bag upside-down to open the device pocket, like I said before. But when I put my external mouse in a pocket, it tends to fall out. It's heavier, smaller and slicker than the power cable, so it can eject itself quite easily. The accessory pouches don't necessarily need a zipper. A little flap of Velcro or an elastic band around a button would be enough to prevent it from gaping open. I might have to get a little crafty and rig something up myself.","[]","B01N9TRR4K","B01N9TRR4K","AELZBSF346JGUY452XEXATCA2KKA","2017-04-28 03:01:10.000","9","True","510"

Lightness: this new Fire is small and light and adds very little weight to any bag that I might carry it in.\\n2.) Screen:  For a lower resolution screen, this looks great!\\n3.) Memory card slot:  It's about time!  Thanks!\\n4.) Screen Size:  It's a nice compromise that aids in size and portability.  I'd prefer a larger screen, but the combination of price and lightness make this a great little tablet.\\n5.) Price:  Great price.  Although not as functional as many of the high-priced tablets out there, this is a great deal!\\n6.) OS Software:  this is a mixed bag for me.

It is however marred by too many bugs that can become very annoying!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nSoftware: I have never experienced such a combination of smoothness and bugs in one device.\\n\\n1.) Random Apps Loading - I have experienced the opening of games, and occasionally books, upon merely sliding the unlock screen to the open position!  As a side-note, I made certain that said games and books were fully closed and the selection screen was away from any accidental activation of them.\\n\\n2.) Force closing of books - I have experienced many, and I mean many, times when I am in the middle of reading and or highlighting in a book when the book closes and then another book opens! My highlights are not lost when I reopen the book, but I am brought back to an earlier chapter.  It does not happen all of the time, but at it's worst it happened around 10-times in a one-hour span of reading and marking the text.\\n\\nNote: The software was automatically updated by Amazon, so old OS problems should have been corrected.\\n\\nWere it not for the pros mentioned above, this device would be a one-star device.\\n\\nHopefully, this can be corrected by an update or new device!","[]","B01ACEKAJY","B01BRWH8G8","AE7FRNCCNLTUWIRPBDJXBRZ2A3HQ","2017-01-05 17:14:10.000","2","True","510"
"822861","5","Fit Perfectly and Do Their Job Perfectly, Too.  Overpriced, However.","These dummy batteries fit perfectly and do their function just as perfectly.  My wife picked one up after I unpacked the set from the box and asked why it was so lightweight.  I told her it is just an empty shell with a wire going from one end to the other.  Anticipating her next question I explained it is to cut the voltage in half with pairs of rechargeable lithium batteries. A new alkaline battery is typically about 1.6 Volts and a non-rechargeable lithium battery is about 1.85 volts.  Most all electronics will handle non-rechargeable 1.85 volt batteries.  The rechargeable lithium batteries are 3.7 volts, exactly twice as much voltage as a non-rechargeable lithium battery.  It makes me wonder why they can't create a rechargeable lithium battery that is 1.85 volts, just like the non-rechargeable versions.  But there is probably a good technical reason why it's not available on the market.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the 3.7-volt rechargeable lithium batteries are abundantly available along with universal chargers. There's somewhat of a startup investment to take advantage of this method of switching from pairs of standard non-rechargeable batteries to rechargeable batteries.  These dummy batteries are vastly overpriced, but they are not in full production quantities yet - still waiting for the demand to catch up.\\n\\nThe same scheme is available for AAA batteries as well.  I bought some AAA rechargeable lithium batteries with a regulating circuit in the end that made it 2 mm longer than a standard AAA battery thinking the spring would allow the extra length.  I was wrong - too long.  Now I need to buy some AAA batteries that are standard length.  They won't have the safety circuit, but they will fit.  The AAA version of this dummy battery was exactly correct of course - just the battery was the problem.  I won't buy any more batteries that are 2 mm too long.  They are useless if they won't fit - cost quite a lot extra, too.  I'll probably find a place I can use the extra long batteries eventually, but so far, I haven't found anything where they will fit. You have to have pairs of batteries:  One dummy battery and one 3.7 volt rechargeable lithium battery.  If you have four batteries, you need two dummy batteries - doesn't matter what order you put them.","[]","B010NDAITG","B010NDAITG","AGZC734FUDTRUS54AWY5NO7XHCIQ","2017-12-21 22:42:56.246","12","True","510"

I've been retired for a few years and living on Social Security, which is really social but not terribly secure. After a few years of this, I decided to go back to school (at the tender age of 71) to get a 2 year Associate's Degree in Digital Photography. My schooling requires that I have a camera, two lenses, and a variety of other odds and ends, which brings me to my review.\\nI wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this bag but it has exceed expectations. It holds a Nikon D7200, a Nikon 18-70 lens, a Nikon 55-300 lens, a 500 gb external hard drive, case for the hard drive, a way-cool First2savvy leather camera case, five (yes, 5!) spare camera batteries, charger for the batteries, fat owner's manual for the camera, lens cleaning kit, two screen protectors for the Nikon, an Anker portable card reader, a 55&#34; tripod which can fir on either the side of the bag or across the top, and it still has room for at least two more lenses! Pshew!\\nI will admit that it does get heavy but you have the ability to wear it as a back pack, making the load much easier to carry.\\nIn closing, if you're seriously considering a more expensive big-name bag, go ahead and buy it, but realize you're doing it out of vanity. I've learned the value of a dollar over the years, having made and lost a couple of small fortunes. Amazon knows the value of a dollar too, and their basic lines are chock full of value. I have owned this bag for a few months and use it every day, both in class and out in the field. It has zippers galore, everything is at your fingertips, and it can be custom-fitted to any equipment you might have by way of adjustable pockets. Even loaded up with equipment this bag keeps it's shape and even has zippers on the outside for more stuff. I mean, what do you want out of a camera bag? If you're getting into photography, buy this bag!

If I could afford $1000 for one, I probably would have done that. Instead, I found this adapter for as a workable solution.\\n\\nAttach a monitor to this card (the package I bought included HDMI, VGA and DVI ports/adapters), plug this into your USB port, download the display link driver online (google it), and it works, both on windows and OS/X. I did not try it on Linux.  It works seamlessly with windows and OS/X  Display configuration, allowing you to position the display relative to the other as usual.  I have not attempted screen rotation or any other advanced features, however.\\n\\nCaveat:  this will also work through a USB 2.0 port, but the video is a little slow/choppy.  This is what is on my MacBook 2011.\\n\\nI tried it via USB 3.0 port on a windows surface 4 pro, and it works much more smoothly.\\n\\nTo amend this, I am going to purchase a thunderbolt dock for my Mac, and use this adapter via one of the USB 3.0 ports on the dock. Presumably the performance should improve.  If it does not, I will update this review to reflect that.  However, this is not a fault of the adapter.  If you have a MacBook with built-in USB 3.0 ports, I assume you will be perfectly fine.\\n\\nLastly, I am only using this for basic web browsing and office work. I'm not playing games through this, and I would not expect it to perform well with 3-D gaming.  If you're doing that, it's likely you have a decent video card that can support two, three or four monitors already, so that should be a non-issue.\\n\\n Before purchasing this, I did quite a bit of research on display link, thunderbolt, HDMI, all the options for adding extra displays through laptops.  I was skeptical that a USB connection would have enough band with, but I was pleasantly surprised.

My system has looked great ever since I bought sleeved, white, and combed cables for 24-pin, PCIe 8-pins, and EPS 8-pin cables. But, those were the only white accents in the black colored interior, which were nicely highlighted by my Blue LEDs... but something was missing.\\n\\nHaving a water cooler AIO for the GPU and another for my CPU (Enermax TR4 360 for my Threadripper 1950x) meant that those black sleeved tubing did not stand out, NOR blend with the ongoing theme of the case of white sleeving. THAT's when the CableMod AIO Sleeving kit came in.\\n\\nI have only one so far, I might get one for my GTX 1080 Hybrid as well, but I used it on my Enermax TR4 Cooler - the tubing is only a bit larger in diameter from the NZXT and EVGA solutions, so it fits perfectly. It looked great, but the clamps were not an option. Way too tight, even if for the EVGA one (I tried it there... do not recommend). So, I used a clever trick with some black electrical tape I bought on Amazon years ago.\\n\\nHere's the trick: take a piece of tape longer than the tube diameter, but not too long to have to circle it twice. Then, cover the adhesive side of the large piece of tape with a smaller piece of electrical tape (with both adhesive sides in contact) - or you can use a piece of paper, and cut it to the size you need. I did this because I did not want the adhesive to touch the sleeve, as it leaves residue behind. At the end, only a little bit of the larger tape should have adhesive exposed. Then, wrap it around the end of the sleeving (and likely of the tubing, close to the radiator or block) nice and tight, and VOILA!\\n\\nI'll post the photos when I get home, but it came out PERFECT! It looks really nice now, and continues my case's theme of contrasting black with white. Although I wish the sleeving would be more closed (it lets the original tube color slip a bit between each fabric of the sleeve) and that it would be maybe $15 as opposed to $20+, it is the only solution for custom AIO sleeving.","[]","B073RYVGC1","B09R6R91YP","AHKDTSXR7WQBHTNWSVZLAGXGWHYA","2017-09-28 17:36:41.524","0","True","510"

I've generally stuck with the free earbuds that came with my iphone and on occasion will buy some cheapie Skull Candy earbuds for 9 bucks or whatever.  Still, when I had the opportunity to receive these high quality headphones for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I jumped at the chance to finally see what the big deal was with these giant headphones that everyone seems to be wearing.  I gotta say... these are fantastic. I never knew headphones could sound like this. The sound is just incredible. I listened to a variety of songs to try and test the headphones (some examples: &#34;Welcome to the Jungle&#34; by GNR, &#34;Brass Monkey&#34; by Beastie Boys, &#34;All Along the Watchtower&#34; by Jimi Hendrix, &#34;Demons&#34; by Imagine Dragons, &#34;Canon in D&#34; by Pachabel, and &#34;Rodeo&#34; by Aaron Copeland). I feel I'm repeating myself, but both my wife and I thought the the sound was just fantastic. I especially enjoyed listening to various classical pieces as the layers of sound were just so rich.\\n\\nI also listened to the headphones/earphones benchmarking test files at audiocheck.net to test the technical claims on the box. I suppose some might be related to my hearing, but in my experience the specs check out. Bass was audible at 20Hz (the box says 10 Hz is the lower limit, but I believe that is lower than human hearing is able to hear.) Treble was audible at 19kHz though my understanding as is that treble hearing decreases with age so that could just be me.\\n\\nLooks-wise, these are also very stylish. The cherry ear cups are lovely and the padding around the ear cover is very plush and comfortable. It blocks ambient noise very well. I like that the headphones fold up a bit (more than I expected them to anyway) and the carrying case they come with is very nice. They also come with an adapter for airplanes and another adapter that I'm not really sure what it goes to. A mixing board or something.\\n\\nAll told, I am really enjoying listening to my music with these headphones.","[]","B01LZH3DF0","B01N0QWAVX","AHBWAVRW22FT4GAN2VTWYNAEQFHQ","2017-05-23 17:51:35.000","3","False","510"
"321794","3","Very compact and light, weak ball head despite the load rating.","Good for what it is, but the ball head load capacity is overstated. More detail on that later but first overall review:\\n\\nThis tripod is fairly sturdy and light, and very compact. Probably one of the better options for small camera and lens combos I have seen. There is an identical aluminum version that weighs 8 ounces more and is nearly half the price. Not for heavier camera combos despite the claimed load capacity. Weight is usually a good indicator of support. I'd love to see this same tripod with a ball head that is 3-4 ounces beefier and much stronger.\\n\\nThe machining is good but not great. Can see some small chips around where the hex fasteners were drilled through the composite carbon fiber layers. I wiped down with a wet rag and there was a bit of carbon or black dust on the rag. Carbon is not dangerous unless breathable fibers are produced, but still they should clean these better.\\n\\nThe leg locks are excellent half twist variety and disassemble easily for cleaning. Durable design from what I can tell.\\n\\nThe inclusion of the short center column is particularly nice.\\n\\nThe ball tension knob doesn't have a great feel, is small and hard in the fingers, and difficult to tighten all the way down.\\n\\nMore detail on the ball head: I bought two of these and found the ball head easy to move on each when fully tightened down with about 7 pounds of gear on it with the head level. Remember this product is rated for 13.2 pounds, or 28 pounds if you buy just the head, while some Sirui tripods with the same head are rated at 8.8 pounds. These manufacturers need to start specifying the load condition that justifies their measurements. My Kirk BH-1 is rated for 15 pounds and is incredibly strong, blowing this little ballhead out of the water - Kirk used a realistic rating.\\n\\nNote: the same ball head C-10, C-10S, C-10s all sold by Sirui with different tripods have wildly different load ratings but they are all the same. A tiny sphere makes up the ball, and you cannot cheat physics- not enough ball surface to clamp down on so this cannot bear large weight. Enough said- this is for small to medium weight cameras, I'd replace the head for anything heavier. The legs are fine for the rated weight.","[]","B01FG7XDDC","B01FG7XDDC","AFJQNSYSOCK6QLO7TNE2HCFSW2YQ","2017-12-21 03:55:07.085","7","True","510"
"206331","5","A replacement digitizer that is as close to the original as you can get!","I have been repairing iPads for many years now and as anyone in this business knows, when it comes to replacement parts it's a crapshoot. You never know how good or bad the part is going to be; whether it will fail within days or weeks with no touch response in sections of the digitizer, etc., or whether or not it will even work out of the box. To my surprise and delight, this replacement digitizer is as close to the original one I've ever seen. It's thicker than the cheap knockoff ones, the touch response is excellent, and it's held up flawlessly with heavy daily use. Even more surprising is that the adhesive held! Anyone who's ever replaced an electronic that requires he use of double-sided adhesive knows that in most cases the adhesive doesn't hold! The adhesive on this digitizer stayed stuck down. I did make sure every speck of the old adhesive was removed from the frame, and ever millimeter of the frame was clean and free of adhesive, glass, or any other dirt or debris. Here's a tip for good adhesive placement: Using cotton swabs dipped in Goo Gone (squeeze out excess cleaning fluid) rub gently along the frame where the old adhesive was. Make sure you do not touch any of the electronic components with the swab! Then after all adhesive, dirt and debris is cleaned off, use an alcohol swab and carefully clean away the Goo Gone or similar fluid making sure none remains. Then go around the frame with another alcohol swab just to make sure it's ready for adhesive application. Test the replacement digitizer and make sure it is working correctly. Check every square inch and verify its responds to touch like it should. Then remove the adhesive covering and install the digitizer. Once in place, using a heat gun or hair dryer on low, go around the edges to soften the adhesive, then gently press down all the way around. This helps in the adhesion process, Do not use the same amount of heat you did to remove the old digitizer. I also like to use a flat object such as a hard cover book or other object that I place on top of the iPad right after I get the digitizer installed. The weight also aids in adhesion. Just don't use too much weight, you don't want to damage the new digitizer or the iPad, but I've found I can use quite a bit of weight. Hope this information is helpful.","[]","B01LZ3ZHZD","B01LZ3ZHZD","AGFQHHOGE5GBUESFLOABO4PXN2WQ","2017-01-08 23:23:13.000","59","True","510"
"782305","5","Love it!","After reading some of the rave reviews and watching a YouTube video on how to mount it on the wall, I decided to purchase this model. When I initially bought this TV mount, I didn't realize the wall above my fireplace didn't have a center stud. I really wanted the mount to be centered on the wall. I did some further research online, and figure that I can do it myself and make it a project, instead of hiring a professional. I got to own some brand-new tools on top of that.\\n\\nI went to Home Depot and bought everything I needed. Just to let everyone know, I am not a handyman. This is my first project with major tools. I owned just a hammer, Phillip and Flathead screwdriver before this project. I bought a 3/4 inch plywood and had it cut to size at the store (16” x 20”), which spanned over 2 wood studs that are 16&#34; apart. I used a combination of 1/4 inch snap toggle bolts and lag screws. The weight of my 40” TV and mounting brackets is only 36lbs total, but I wanted to make sure that bolts/screws can take it over time, especially when the TV is going to be extended and swung back and forth. I drilled 1/2 inch pilot holes in the wall for the snap toggles and 3/16 inch holes for lag screws. I drilled 1/4 inch pilot holes on the plywood. For aesthetic, I cut up a piece of leftover wallpaper and stuck it on top and poked the holes with my screwdriver.\\n\\nI wanted my TV low enough to have a good line-of-sight and not strain my neck while sitting. To do this, I had to compensate the position of the plywood for the position of the TV, since the 2 wood studs did not run all the way down the wall. I wish it did because it would have been a lot easier to install, but my new handy-dandy stud finder showed only drywall partway down. Therefore, I positioned 2/3 of the plywood to be supported by a combo of 4 lag screws (2 per stud) and snap toggle bolts (2 in the center near the bracket), while the bottom 1/3, I used 2 snap toggles. Load and behold it worked!  I am so happy with the finished project. I hope someone will find this useful.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513PrsmTi-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513PrsmTi-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513PrsmTi-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J2H2M6ptL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J2H2M6ptL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J2H2M6ptL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Mir0a+vBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Mir0a+vBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Mir0a+vBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fTCeHbfoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fTCeHbfoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fTCeHbfoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00EVXEW7Y","B00EVXEW7Y","AHQNP4LC374ZKYDO3KABLYWHRGFA","2017-12-30 02:47:31.908","3","True","510"
"466609","4","The sound is REALLY good for the price","I am a professional bass (that's how you spell it...) player AND sound engineer. I did NOT buy these through Amazon, but I thought it could be helpful to write a quick review:\\n\\nThe sound is REALLY good for the price. I've tried many including Sony, JBL and others within this price range and these are the best so far. The sound is a little bit boxy, but overall it's a very balanced frequency response. They excite the bass just a hair, but not so that it ruins every non-bass-heavy music: you can listen to jazz, funk, motown, classical, rock, pop, and about everything on these without trashing the sound. The low-mids are a hair muddy, but again, nothing crazy: listening to a jazz trio (piano, upright, drums), or a Latin big band, is still pretty darn enjoyable. I would actually say the muddiness comes more from the very lows, probably 40-60Hz, and fighting against the low-mids make it sound a bit boxy. High-mids seem a little quiet, but that could be because the lows and low mids are a bit boosted. The treble is perfect, nothing harsh (as I have experienced particularly with Sony earbuds around this price)\\n\\nThis comes from the audio engineer in me. Yes, I play bass, I've toured, I've recorded in big studios in NYC and LA, I've recorded a bunch of albums with a bunch of artists, and I'm pretty active in the scene. But I'm also an engineer: I like balanced sound, and I'm looking for that when buying earphones, headphones, speakers, etc. I don't want hyped bass or anything. I've worked doing live band recordings, the Winter Jazz Festival in NYC, numerous churches (from Catholic where they play JS Bach music, to contemporary where it's basically the Christian version of Demi Lovato kinda band), live concerts in open spaces, and I'm constantly mixing for numerous artists. I would hope I know what I'm talking about!!!\\n\\nPeople complaining about these not having enough bass response are obviously obsessed with bass and biased towards low-end hype. Nothing wrong with that, but just wanted to leave an engineers perspective. 4 stars for good sound for about $40!!! Would be 5 starts if it didn't have that low-end bump =)","[]","B00NQ17ZUS","B00OW44P8I","AG7D7FLX2VNKHIEPOEAYLPKEPRDQ","2017-02-10 14:50:41.000","6","False","509"

Read speeds are fast enough to play HD movies without any glitch.  I haven't experienced it getting too hot like others, but I probably don't use it as intensely as others.  I use these kinds of USB flash drives as an &#34;archive&#34; drive (more reads than writes, like music or video playback), I don't expect them to perform as well and reliably as hard drives and PC drives designed for operating system main drive usage.\\n\\nA real-world write-speed benchmark:  I'm getting about 8 MB/s average (with fastest intermittent writes of 15MB/s) writing music MP3 files to the drive, on a laptop, I think on a USB2.0 port.  As comparison on the same machine, I get consistent 17MB/s writing the same files to a USB hard drive plugged into the exact same port.  If using Windows OS and copying lots of tiny files, copying slows down A LOT even on faster WD/Seagate hard drives, that's probably a &#34;feature&#34; of the OS, I zip/rar those directories.\\n\\nWriting large video files is faster (less OS-related overhead).  Using Teracopy instead of the Windows Explorer speeds things up a little too.\\n\\nWriting clearly slows down when I'm competing for disk access on the PC (for the PC's main hard disk, not for the flash drive.  If I'm running a disk intensive application, if virus scan is hitting the hard disk, etc.), but that is to be expected.\\n\\nIf it actually wrote much faster, I'd be thrilled, but I can live with this speed for most of my needs.  I'm not using this drive as a cache or the main OS disk!!!\\n\\nI haven't gotten any errors writing or reading from this drive, but again, I don't use it for an everyday &#34;scratch space&#34; drive.  I understand most flash drives have a limit of how many times they can write and erase before becoming unreliable.  If I get a chance to test it on a USB 3.0 port, and maybe a faster machine, I'll post benchmarks.","[]","B01BGTG3JA","B06XHWWJRW","AH52MYVB55CW5HN6N3F74BGZFFWQ","2017-03-09 00:13:07.000","1","True","509"

But after the latest Windows 10 update (my wife's laptop, i run W7) it quit working properly.  I purchased another Access Point, but it was simply a wireless converter and had no range at all, so i returned it and purchased this item.  It took a little bit to set up but it works terrific.  It's connected to a Xerox Phaser 6180 MFP and the speed increase over the TEW MFP is significant.  It feels like there is some buffering in the unit as printer is much much faster than before.  If you want to use this as a print server, it's pretty easy.\\n\\nSetup Tips (to connect to printer remotely) :\\n\\n1.  Just follow the menu to set this up as a client and enter your network SSID and password.  Connect the network cable (RJ-45) to your printer.  Should work fine.\\n2.  However, in the configuration above,  I used DHCP.  I could read the printer IP on the printer panel and entered that in the &#34;Add Printer&#34; / &#34;Printer I want isn't listed&#34;/ &#34;Enter IP Address&#34;.  The problem was that if we had a power outage or I rebooted my router the IP address could be reassigned and I'd lose connectivity.\\n3.  I tried to set a static IP on the WA 901, but i had issues adding the printer to windows.  HERE'S THE SOLUTION:  Leave the WA901 on DHCP, but assign the Xerox printer a STATIC IP from THE PRINTER PANEL menu, Admin menu, Network, Ethernet, IP .  For example, i used 192.168.0.99.  My router assigns addresses from 192.168.0.101, 102, 103, 104, 105, etc.  So this avoids a IP collision.\\n4.  Since i only use the printer a few times a week, in this config i can turn the WA901 off when i'm not using it (to save power, the printer has a &#34;sleep mode&#34;.  When i turn it on, everything is fine and it hooks up right away.","[]","B002YETVXC","B002YETVXC","AHIO77MN4KHQSTBPM7B5OVAB7MQQ","2017-06-26 12:54:16.519","0","True","509"

I wanted one that is slightly larger (23-24” was about right), has two HDMI ports, is Full HD (1080), and has built-in speakers.  This one clearly fits those categories.\\n\\nPros:\\n- The screen is big.  I didn’t realize that going from 21” to 24” would be that different, but it is.  Having very narrow bezels helps.\\n- Things appear to be sharp at or near full brightness.  However, I don’t use monitors at this setting and I’ll mention my impressions at lower brightness levels in the cons section.\\n- The speakers are better than you think.  Sure, they aren’t great compared to external speakers, but for internal speakers (which are rare nowadays), they are pretty good.\\n- HDMI cable is included\\n\\nCons:\\n- Text (Windows 10 desktop text and Office 2013 in particular) does not appear as sharp at lower brightness levels.  Admittedly, the 1080 resolution may have reached its limits at this screen size and, to me at least, didn’t appear as sharp as I would like when dimming the screen.\\n- The ports do not appear to be auto-switching.  I have two computers that were connected via HDMI.  If I power off one computer and then turn on the second computer, the monitor will not automatically switch to the active video source unless the monitor is turned off and on or you use the menu option to search for the active input.\\n- When the monitor is on standby, the power button flashes.  There doesn’t appear to be a way to turn that off.\\n- The monitor can have a noticeable amount of movement on the stand.  However, if you have a sturdy table, it should be fine.  Alternatively, you can buy your own stand since the monitor is VESA compatible.\\n- It is somewhat pricey for its specs.\\n\\nI really wanted to like this monitor, but after a few days’ usage, I decided to return it.  No matter what settings I tried, viewing it caused too much eye strain.  It was either too bright or text was a little too blurry.","[]","B01BX3FCJG","B01BX3FCJG","AHSR7MKSDSEIQGXR5YHBSTQJ2IRQ","2017-01-31 05:38:38.000","11","True","509"

I will issue another review on their service when and if the problem is resolved.\\n-When the wifi is not working this scope is totally useless since there is no other easy way to control it without modifications.\\n-For me the auto calibration was not reliable. If you select the wrong stars or don't get the process just right the calibration fails and you have to restart.  This costs a half hour or longer. On the other hand the manual calibration has worked perfect for me each time. On the manual calibration you do have to find the star names and select them on the app but the app will help you find them.\\n-If the wifi drops after you have started moving the scope it will not stop moving since you have no wifi control of it. To prevent any damage immediately turn off the scope power button. Unfortunately when you start and reconnect you will have to recalibrate. Also after you reconnect the scope may start moving again and then stop so be careful. If it does not stop hit the power off again.\\n-The manual is only 8 pages and of little use. It incorrectly told me how to set the slider switch for wifi access. My other manual from another Celestron scope is 48 pages and packed with useful information.\\n-This scope is so new I can find very few users and there is little information that is shared. I myself view this as a beta version and should have been more careful in selecting this scope.\\n-There is no information available on interfacing this scope with a laptop or of how to configure the scope to communicate in direct access mode or point access mode.","[]","B01L0EQMZQ","B0BCHZD15K","AEDYGEWQ6JMIPU2SG4HGXAWQRJEA","2017-06-28 00:07:40.762","15","False","509"

I kept worrying that there was something about this valve that was different from others and I was missing some key information. How much would it have added to the cost of this item to get a set of instructions written in fluent American English?\\n\\nThe marks on the device were very difficult to see (maybe this was just a defect in mine) but this made set up more difficult than it needed to be.\\n\\nAfter numerous adjustments over nearly two months, I was never able to manage to get the device to simultaneously reach the correct level in the toilet and then totally shut off the flow of water.  It is not like I have never adjusted or installed this type of toilet valve before. This one always ran or, if I changed one or two adjustments to get the flow to stop, the toilet would not fill properly.  Perhaps mine was simply defective but I wasted a lot of time and water coming to the conclusion that it could not be set up properly.\\n\\nBy contrast, when, after nearly two months of trying various adjustments, I finally replaced it with the item mentioned at the top of my revview, the new install took 15 mins. and a couple of adjustments and it works perfectly. (I should add that I have no connection with Fluidmaster nor with HomeDepot).\\n\\nI note that others have had good luck with this device so I don't want to give it a &#34;one star&#34; rating as perhaps mine was simply defective. But there were other problems and because I am rather busy, I did not want to take a chance on more problems and time down the drain and so I did not  even try to get a replacement.

"743196","2","Sounds good.  Unrefined.  A little buggy.","This is not a bad player, but it lacks refinement and the interface is clumsy with a bug or two.  Kudos for file support and the sound quality is good.  The custom EQ settings allow you to fine tune the sound to your liking.  Build quality is good.  It feels like a quality device and so far the finish has been very durable.\\n\\nThat being said, the player has a few flaws.  To begin, battery life is poor.  I generally get about 3 and a half hours of play time.  If you don't power down, the unit will drain itself in a day or so even if it is not being used.  When the screen idles you are restricted to two buttons that increase and decrease the volume or advance the track with a long hold.  Given that there are six switches it seems silly to restrict all play functions to the volume rocker when the screen is off.\\n\\nThe jog wheel is a little sloppy so it can some getting used to but overall it is effective.  The browse options are a strength.  You can search by folder, genre, artist, album, etc, but it would be nice if there was a way to browse your library without scrolling through every album, track or folder.  Allowing alphabetical filtering would compliment the numerous browse options.\\n\\nOne quirk of the unit is that the shuffle feature often gets confused.  If you shuffle a genre the player will inexplicably jump to a different genre, or drill down into a single artist and stay there until you restart at the genre level.\\n\\nA bigger bug is that occasionally the player crashes.  There is a firmware update but it's posted on a forum and you have to request access to the download from a user with no clear connections to the manufacturer, so the whole thing seems a little sketchy.\\n\\nGiven the price point I don't think this is terrible unit because of the file support and sound quality.  If you're looking for a great sounding player that supports lossless files and you can deal with a few bugs and an interface that lacks polish, this will be a good buy.\\n\\nI missed something in my first review.  You cannot listen to the device while it charges.  Coupled with poor battery life, if you listen a lot you may want to have a second device or be prepared to stream to your phone.","[]","B01M1KSUJX","B01M1KSUJX","AEZHDIFSMOEHXZHZXKMACCE3IYKA","2017-05-13 01:35:42.000","3","True","509"
"3272","3","Interesting Gadget, Works as Advertised, But Tied to Smartphone","This SAMSUNG GEAR S2 SMARTWATCH (Dark Gray) is an interesting gadget, and works as advertised.  It's kind of fun to make and receive telephone calls from your wristwatch (just like Dick Tracy did in the comic strips with his 2-way wrist radio).  However, to be able to make calls, you need to register it with your cellphone network (on Verizon, this entails a $30 activation fee, plus $5 a month thereafter).\\n\\nYou can use the Gear S2 for lots of things without activating the phone, of course.  There is a fitness tracker app, and there are interactive watch faces that can keep you abreast of your favorite teams' real-time game scores, the current stock market numbers, and other things.  However, I like my [[ASIN:B00N2BW2PK Fitbit-Charge-Wireless-Activity-Wristband]] much better for telling time and for activity tracking--the Fitbit is easier to use, and does more things reliably.\\n\\nThe biggest drawback regarding the apps, is that they are tied to your smartphone.  All of the Gear S2 apps use Bluetooth for running the app from your phone.  This means your smartphone has to be turned on, within the Bluetooth range, and charged, for the apps to work.  One problem that I never solved with the NBA watch face, was that the real-time scoring updates would stop when my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge went into sleep or dormant mode after about an hour.\\n\\nFinally, the Gear needs frequent charging--every day or two.  This means you can't really treat it like a watch that you leave on your wrist 24/7.  You have to treat it like a cellphone, and take it off for charging every night.\\n\\nA negative about activating the phone--boo to Verizon!--is that my assigned phone line had been previously assigned to someone who had a lot of people still looking for him/her.  Thus I got a lot of unwanted calls from the moment the Gear S2 was fully activated.\\n\\nMy Gear S2 was free (from a Samsung/Verizon deal with my preorder of the Galaxy S7 Edge).  I'm very glad that I didn't pay a couple of hundred dollars for mine, as it turned out that I have no need for a smartwatch.","[]","B015JQ62RY","B0163JVYEW","AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","2017-01-01 16:27:37.000","0","False","509"
"743029","5","Great day pack for a day on your feet with the camera","If you are looking for a solid day pack that can carry gear and odds and ends safely around town or on a modest afternoon hike, but is only the size of a school book bag, this is a good purchase. The front pocket can easily accommodate a 10&#34; tablet, a book or two, magazines, or other flat objects. The top compartment is pretty spacious. You could easily fit a few books, a spare rain jacket or fleece, shoes, snacks, or other gear. The camera compartment can be customized and has good padding. In the camera compartment I can put a Nikon d5600 with a 17-50mm f/2.8 lens attached, a 35mm prime, and an 18-140mm telephoto, and a few odds and ends (charger, etc.). I think it would easily accommodate a full frame camera as my smaller camera body has room to spare. If you reconfigure the internal space you could bring along a bigger zoom than the one I have. Of course, you can also put large lenses, extra bodies, and other things in the spacious top compartment. There are also two water bottle sleeves that can take a slimmer bottle (think 24-26 oz. bottle for a bike, not a wide Nalgene for camping). It also has an included rain cover that lives in its own little pocket. Best of all, it doesn't look like a camera bag. I'm positive it fits easily in an overhead compartment, even on a regional jet.\\n\\nThis is a comfortable bag and well constructed, but it is designed for light travel. It isn't a solution for an overnight hike or if you need to lug around a professional kit for an all-day shoot, but I'd carry it on a trail for 10 miles or around a city all day if I were playing tourist and wanted to travel light while indulging my photo bug.\\n\\nThings this backpack does NOT seem to do:\\n-There are no ties or fasteners to attach extra stuff to the exterior of the bag. You can probably put a slender, small portable tripod in the water bottle holder, but not securely.\\n-There is no real hip belt (just a strap), but it would be hard to load it down enough to need one.\\n-There is no dedicated space for a water bladder system\\nIf you want or need all those other things, get the Photo Sport 200/300 AW.","[]","B01C4ABAC0","B0BKS3DMHB","AFCYRWKZ4OYSI5PGIL7IUJMLGK5A","2017-12-12 18:59:48.164","3","True","509"
"335198","2","Good hardware, lousy UI-- and AD BANNERS in the home screen","I bought this in order to have an Alexa-enabled device connected to our media center and be able to play Prime music through the home stereo. It does that well, and I am happy to give this three stars based on that low-expectation functionality.\\n\\nFire TV 4K fails to get any more stars because I do not enjoy the user interface. I do not like that I have no way to explicitly browse content that streams for free via my Prime membership. I am frustrated that Amazon consistently interjects media content that is pay-per-view in search results and category browsing. Amazon has intentionally chosen not to include flagging on the thumbnails that identifies which content is Prime and which is not. In the mobile Prime Video app interface, this is a convenient feature. Fire TV has introduced a regression in this regard by requiring users to click on a thumbnail before they can find out if something is pay-per-view or free. I am tempted to drop a star on this review simply because of this frustration.\\n\\nAnother thing that sucks about the UI is the proliferation of horizontal scrolling of thumbnails. This requires a separate button push for EVERY thumbnail, of which there are usually dozens in a horizontally-arranged list. I would prefer to see vertical pages of thumbnails that I could scroll down on and only have to push the button per row of three or four thumbnails. I suspect there was some user group testing where they found people perceived the collection of content was greater if it was arranged in this manner rather than in vertically-scrolling pages.\\n\\nI'm also not fond of the trailers they squeeze in front of the content you are trying to watch. It's just another obstacle to have to leap past. It would be one thing if they used their robust analytics capabilities to present properly-targetted content trailers, but it's clearly generic advertising.\\n\\nMy hope is that Amazon will improve these UI failures and make this device much better. The hardware aspect of this product is satisfactory.\\n\\nUPDATE 10/31: I dropped a star. Review is now two-stars. This evening I saw a banner ad on the Fire TV 4k home screen advertising a Hewlett Packard computer. I did not buy what I thought was a premium media player for me to be sold to advertisers as a captive audience for ads. I am strongly considering returning this device to purchase an AppleTV 4k unit.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8156IfsgI2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8156IfsgI2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8156IfsgI2L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01N32NCPM","B075JZNHTD","AGWP74NYKYQSFD3IL5GNFIMNTABQ","2017-10-27 20:48:41.082","4031","True","509"
"468291","1","Shuts down when it gets hot, non-existent support from Samsung","I really did my homework before I bought my Gear 360 and so I understood the requirements of owning a supporting Samsung phone to get the &#34;full use&#34; of the camera. However, the camera, phone and app suffer from many flaws and limitations. Not to mention the absolutely dismal &#34;support&#34; from Samsung.\\n\\nIf the camera gets slightly warm while recording video, it will shut off. It's particularly vulnerable when recording at higher res as that generates more internal heat. I've had a GoPro sit recording for hours in plexiglass enclosed aircraft cockpit, in the summer and not skip a beat. My 360 died after 20 minutes while doing a test run in a moving car with the ambient temp hovering around 80F.\\n\\nThe Samsung app (latest version to support the Gear 360 2017) crashes often. So yes, it's a Samsung phone, using a Samsung app connected to a Samsung camera and they still can't get it to work correctly. If you don't believe me read the app's reviews on Google Play.\\n\\nNext, if you use the striped down version of Power Director that comes with the camera, your videos will be stitched in the software BUT your output videos will look like crud. If you want to use any other desktop video editing software that supports 360 videos then you MUST save the videos to your phone to stitch them. They copy them from the phone to the pC. This is excruciatingly slow.\\n\\nThe process of saving the video clips to my phone and then moving them to my PC took the better part of entire day for approx. 40 minutes of raw video. (NOT Captured at the highest res for fear of the camera shutting down.)\\n\\nFinally, if you try to contact Samsung about these or any other issues related to the Gear 360 forget it. They will not have a clue what you are talking about and if you ask a hard question like &#34;Why does it shut off when it gets hot?&#34; they will ignore you or ask you sometujhing stupid like &#34;Did yo uget it wet?&#34;. I have tried chat, email and phone support and ALL simply suck.\\n\\nThere are other 360 cameras out there that get slightly better reviews. I'd look much closer at one of them before committing to the Gear 360.","[]","B01D9LVL3G","B076ZWHVG4","AHESIR2RLXOYYCNGI5JYP2I5FTNQ","2017-06-08 18:57:07.583","11","False","509"

The first Paperwhite, A Voyage, the first Oasis and now the second Oasis.  The previous ones have all been nice upgrades from the previous version.  However, this Oasis has me on the edge of returning it.\\n\\nThe good.. the display is very nice.  Good lighting, large size.  This is why I do not give it only one star.\\n\\nThe could be better..  Not many sizes of type compared to the previous Oasis (with the most recent software version).  Its a bit heavier and the case is cold to the touch and more slippery\\n\\nThe I am not sure I want to keep this...\\n\\n1) the metal case has SHARP edges around the outside front.  This is the kind of thing I would expect on a $20 device, not the top of the line Kindle.  Its not sharp enough to cut yourself on, but its far from comfortable.  I could spend an hour to carefully polish out the edge, but I should not HAVE to do that.  This thing is meant to be hand held for long periods, so this is a really bad cost savings blunder on Amazon's part.\\n\\n2) the battery life is HORRIBLE.  I read a lot.  Amazon has always said &#34;months&#34; of time on a charge.  Well, on the other Kindles I have had, that meant a week or two.  I never measured it carefully, but 30 hours sounds about right. Several 300 page novels.\\n\\nThis one, I think I just got maybe 7 hours.  I am writing this review because its charging right now.. when I should have been reading.  All the settings are at the defaults.  WiFi and cellular on, Bluetooth off, and automatic brightness on the display.  I have not really tried playing with changing the settings, but this is the way I have always run my Kindles and I might charge them once per week.  My cell phone lasts longer on a charge that this does!  I got through 1 and 1/4 300 page novels before charging.\\n\\nToo bad I gave away my 2016 Oasis already....","[]","B06VTJWRJW","B06VTJWRJW","AGCNXZ5YLHYKYAKS7PK2EKFKZG5A","2017-11-21 05:35:38.312","3","True","509"

They 2 pairs sound different, but it's hard to say if one is better than the other.\\n\\nCONS.\\nThe only con I found was that these headphones are not very private. For some reason the sound is quite clear and audible for everyone around you. So if you are listening to something that you don't want others to hear - I would not recommend these headphones. They would also probably be quite bothersome to people around you say in an airplane, a library, or any other enclosed space.\\n\\nIf you are using these for video editing or music production at home, I don't think you would care too much that the sound is leaking - however if you are planning on using these for any sort of audio recording - They will most likely ruin your take.\\n\\nOVERALL.\\nIf you are using these for gaming, listening to music, watching movies, and you don't mind other people hearing what you're listening to - they are a great pair of headphones.\\n\\nIf you are going to be using these for any sort of studio recording - voiceovers, foley/ADR or vocal recording - I would not use these.","[]","B06WRMZZ45","B06WRMZZ45","AEJCXMPW2SLJV2XBBJNB52JMUYEQ","2017-05-10 23:12:47.000","3","False","509"

I feel as though this description, &#34;All In One&#34; is misleading as I purchased it as a gift and it is nothing more than a desk ornament. I also purchases Windows 10 to make it 'work', only to realize that it will not load onto the machine. I had an IT friend help with the install and to verify that I was indeed, not crazy. So frustrating, waste of money.\\n\\n&#60;edited&#62; Additional information from IT friend:\\nWell, it’s [title] a little bit misleading, but Dell calls it an All-in-One Desktop on their website.  What it’s missing in the title of this listing is that it’s a Thin Client.  It is, however, called a thin client in the description, though.  However, the seller should have listed what a thin client was since a lot of people don’t know that.  Although it says what it is, this listing is very misleading for anyone who isn’t an IT person or at least with a strong computer background.  Thin clients don’t have any meat to them and are meant to utilize the resources of a central server in a business.  Your cell phone has more “umph” than a thin client.  What’s crazy is that it costs more than a full computer; that’s rapeage.\\n\\nDell actually requires you to dig for it on their website to be able to buy one.

"667314","4","What a shame......","Update 6/6/2017\\nI have had these running now since the beginning of February.\\nI use them with the free cloud service only, will likely upgrade some day.\\n\\nI LOVE THESE CAMERAS. There, I said it.\\n\\nCould low light be better? Yes.\\nCould motion detection be better (more granular, allow exclusion areas....). Yes.\\nDoes it suck when my wireless is funky? Yes (but this is not Kuna's fault).\\n\\nOverall, I find these cameras to be an outstanding value, reliable, and, after almost 20 years in the CCTV business....Excellent!\\n\\nPerfect? Nope. Excellent overall compared to other options? Yes.\\n\\nHere's the deal, this is a great camera with some execution issues.\\n\\nApparently while my 2 Toucans were in transit, an update came out that broke live viewing.  However, I have some thoughts on this. First, it seems to me that these high definition cameras will take a bunch of bandwidth (upstream) to view live.  Make sure you have enough (like 50/50). When you view on the same WiFi that the light is connected to, I would expect viewing to be worse. When it works (occasionally) its awesome.  I have never seen it work on 4G LTE.\\n\\nThe Recordings are beautiful and since you review those from their website, no issues.\\n\\nBTW, there were some complaints about glare from the camera being mounted directly beneath the light. Mine is mounted directly beneath a 100W equivalent LED, I used the little shield that came with and have not a single glare issue. Images are still beautiful.\\n\\nInstallation was super simple. The videos are awesome.\\n\\nThey really need to address live viewing. However, the reviews here and on the app store that are killing it and complaining about no response from support are disturbing.  These feel like the actions of a company going out of business.  I hope someone buys them and does not destroy the good things about the product.  I say this reluctantly as I want more and more people to buy it so they do indeed stay in business, but.....  I hope they release and SDK or API so the cameras can buy use should they go out of business......","[]","B01DFIMFS8","B01DFIMFS8","AGPKKRKK3R4Z7W2O6JZ3U5IM4SWA","2017-02-06 13:24:42.000","35","True","509"

I wrote a scathing review due to these problems. My daughter who was the recipient of this Christmas present emailed this company and even though it took a couple weeks, they did reply with a resolution to the problem.\\n\\nVery simply they had her reformat the sd card. I assume the dashcam must install a hidden file when it does that because now my daughter texted me and said it works like new again. So my bad review was solely reliant upon an sd card that somehow stopped working not the dashcam.\\n\\nI would like to point this out to anyone having problems with this dashcam. REFORMAT YOUR SD CARD before sending in a complaint to the company.\\n\\nOriginal review: I purchased this as a christmas present to my daughter, just what she wanted, excellent video, hooked up great, but after about a week or so the audio stopped working. Now just a week or 2 after the return time Amazon allows the video stopped working. Without audio or video this thing really isn't worth much.\\n\\nI tried resetting with the reset button, even held it for over half a minute to be sure.\\n\\nI switched to a different micro sd card to be sure that wasn't the problem. it comes up on the card with a black 1 second recording then shows not recorded correctly.\\n\\nSo, I tried sending a notice to the company before giving a bad review here hoping they would have some kind of fix or even the remote possiblity that they would replace it. lol after writing the review when I would hit the send button a message kept coming up saying did not send. so I do not know if I can report a problem with them.\\n\\nBe careful with this one, mine is not the first one I saw on here with about the same problem, but I figured the odds are in my favor.\\n\\nI do not work with or have a relationship with this company or any competitors and never have, so I have no prejudism either for or against this item.\\n\\nGood luck if you decide to purchase, it appears many have bought this and it has worked well for them, unless they are mostly fake reviews. :)","[]","B00KOUJO12","B00M0FCFGK","AF4Z35IDQBNH6SXUTHPQBR7VVG7A","2017-02-27 17:44:17.000","9","True","509"
"111630","5","Wear Glasses? These Are Your Headphones!","I tried many headphones before finally settling on these for the perfect blend of comfort, sound, and price.\\n\\nFIT:\\nThey come with three sizes of inner ear molds. The molds are very comfortable, and use the same technology as hearing aid molds which form to your ear shape instead of trying to create a pressure on your ear canal. I've had a lot of issues with in the ear headphones not fitting correctly in my ear canal which is why I went on the hunt for a new set in the first place.\\n\\nSOUND:\\nThese sound identical to all other Bose products. I believe the sound is very balanced and matches the wide variety of music I listen to. If you are concerned about the sound -- go into a store and find a Bose wireless speaker to play with. It will replicate the sound quality of these headphones very closely.\\n\\nDURABILITY:\\nAll the parts are plastic, but the build seems solid. Seams and joints are well connected and smooth. The length of the cord is just right -- long enough to feel comfortable but not long enough to get caught on something.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE:\\nThis is the only con to these headphones. They last about 6 hours of continuous play. In reality, this is about all you need if you are using them to work out or to listen to music on your metro commute to and from work. I am willing to sacrifice some on battery life for what is a much more comfortable and well built product.\\n\\nCOMPARISON:\\nThe other headphones I tried were:\\n\\n- Beats Solo Wireless 3 -- Great sound, and an amazing battery life. Ultimately, they were uncomfortable for more than 15 mins of use because they pressed my ears against my glasses too hard. I considered switching to the Beats Studio (around the ear) but for $100 more and less battery life it just wasn't worth it.\\n\\n- PowerBeats -- Great sound, but also not comfortable for long periods of time.\\n\\n- RHA T20i -- These were the last corded headphones I tried before committing Bluetooth. The cord was stupidly long and caught on everything. They come with way too many parts, and the ear forms fell off after one use. I returned them the day after I got them.","[]","B06XJFZCD5","B06XJFZCD5","AHPJ4WFAVWQOOAR3GBRQBU6M6G5Q","2017-05-18 21:08:42.000","7","False","509"

The streaming is an exercise in absolute frustration.  Navigating menus better suited to computer interfaces with a remote control is frustrating enough(its 2017 and we're still using mostly useless IR remote controls?) but the unavoidable LAG this device has makes anything numbingly annoying. You will push a button, a simple navigation direction, and you can honestly expect upwards of a 15 second delay before anything happens.  This is PER PUSH.  And before you try solving my problems from your armchair, yes I checked for updates and other software support methods.  This is also irrespective of which service you're using, YouTube or Netflix, it doesn't matter whatsoever.\\n\\nNow the other half is the optical drive, the BluRay player.  What a joke.  First of all, the drive is obvious a far inferior mechanical drive that has been sped up, as every time a disc is in the drive (even if not playing) it spins like a B-52 taxiing for takeoff.  That sound bothering you?  You can't even so much as open the drive tray to remove the disc without exiting every menu you're in and returning to the main screen.\\n\\nEverything about this screams crap.  The box build quality is flexible and cheap to the touch, every function it has operates on an interminable delay or simply not at all (the Amazon app still won't recognize my Prime account though other devices have no problem).  It's stable of hundreds of apps are by and large absolutely useless. Considering this is priced at $70, and comparable blu-ray players from other lesser companies start at HALF of that, one would think the Sony name would mean a base level of quality.  That's what I thought.  I've had issues with Sony software in the past, but their hardware has always been exceptional.\\n\\nApparently those days are passing.\\n\\nYou would truly be better served buying a different device.","[]","B01AT6B0DK","B0963TH5MF","AHFZFCGHBDDAF7SAOR3MCFVTZXUA","2017-11-14 16:30:47.150","4","False","509"

They both failed with 2 months of use, and the carrying case I received was not as nice as the picture shows, however I believe the pictures are newer.  I also disapprove of the term 'Limited Edition' used in the name, you'd think the purpose of a limited edition item is to go off sale at some point, but its still hanging around for roughly a year, but that is probably just me wanting to be a special snowflake.  Also the default ear-cups are terrible, it is basically a requirement to get the memory foam one, which are amazing.\\n\\nThe sound signature is exactly what I love, punchy base but without losing the mids and highs.  Some of the songs I listen to do get a little muddled when a full band is playing, and the notes get blurred, I think that is more of the recording being done poorly than the headphones being an issue.  I wouldn't consider myself a crazy audiophile, but I do love my music (multiple pairs of headphones, the crown jewel of which are the He-400i's I bought in late last year) but I find these to be a great pair of daily drivers.\\n\\nI bought these because of the claims of being 'military grade' and while the cables leave a lot to be desired, the headphones only really started encountering issues after roughly a year of abuse.  I used to keep them in their carrying case, which got pretty beat up, but now I just plop them the top of my backpack rapped around the carrying handle while I go through my day.  They've survived several drops,  dings, and being squished when I take my backpack off for the day.  One big issue I that doesn't seem to stem from anything but wear is that on one side, the adjustment band has stopped clicking into place and now slides around, the other one works fine so it stops being a real issue thanks to gravity, but its still an nuisance.\\n\\nI love these headphones despite the issues I've encountered, and with 5 minutes of modding, a Bluetooth wireless receiver, and some Velcro, I made them wireless.  If you listen to punk, EDM, Dubstep, or even jazz, these headphones have you covered.  Get them even if you might not like the look of them, their sound will win you over.","[]","B00HYH7HXA","B00WSM2TRK","AFCQPLVXA5MYCG2WP3X6WZZXFXOA","2017-02-04 00:02:05.000","0","True","509"

The two main reasons for a purchase were to upgrade from G to N speeds, and also from 10/100 Ethernet to full Gigabit capabilities. I also liked the fact that it was able to manage a shared storage device and was dual-band, providing a 5GHz connection.\\n\\nI have a small home with hardly any issues with internal interference. I had the WRT54G for years and never had a problem with signal strength. As a matter of fact, my WRT54G was able to broadcast into my backyard with no problems. However the EA6200 is extremely weak and was barely able to get signal to my second floor. I would also be one room away from it and would show a weakened signal on my i-devices. My Amazon FireTV could barely get a signal on the second floor and would constantly drop out.\\n\\nFor some reason, DNS is problematic with this unit. If you don't know what DNS is, Google it. I have Time Warner (now Spectrum) as an ISP. I would not only have to statically assign the DNS entries on the router but also several of my wireless devices in order to get out to the internet.

This was not the case for me.\\n\\nSide Note: I replaced this router with the EA6350 because it was recommended by a few users who had purchased an EA6200 and had similar issues. Don't bother doing that either because the EA6350 is the same unit with the same problems, it just has external antennas which don't make a difference in signal strength at all.","[]","B00LV7O9FI","B00LV7O9FI","AHIHXEFAWDELFXO7IBF3ORILJHCQ","2017-04-27 14:36:12.000","0","True","509"

Waited too long to open and test it, and the warranty period was long over, so I just bit the bullet on it. Otherwise, I think it would have been nice, hardware-wise. It has Windoze 8.x , and I never did the free urpgrade to Windoze10 with it, but I DO have Win10 on two other tablets- the ASUS Chi T100 and T300. To be blunt, I bought the 8-inchers for bathroom reading, but all I ever do in the short amount of time I power the T100 on, is sit and watch the BLUE SCREEN AGAIN, with &#34;Updating Windows, please do not turn your computer off&#34;, and, the next power-up, &#34;Getting Windows ready, please do not turn your computer off.&#34; Literally. I've gone back to reading my girlfriend's recipe magazines. I DO NOT EVER LEAVE ANY OF MY EQUIPMENT POWERED UP 24/7/365 so it can do whatEVER it claims it wants to do.

It's too convoluted and bloated for a workstation or laptop, let alone a tablet. It is a horrible tablet platform. I would recommend having NOTHING to do with Win10 at all, if possible.

"421522","5","Phaiser is really ridiculous","I have been on Amazon since 1999. I am a Prime member, I buy a metric ton of things from the site every year, yet I almost never write reviews (which I kind of feel guilty about). But these folks are just so absolutely ridiculous, I just had to for this headset.\\n\\nLast year I bought a Taotronics Bluetooth headset which was cheaper than this, but suited me as a Lyft/Uber/Door Dash driver. During one of my runs, I lost the headset after it fell off my neck without my noticing, so I decided to try this one after reading all the reviews.\\n\\nGoing through the manual, I discovered it had many more features (such as the ability to set the equalizer between three modes like bass/treble/etc by holding down the middle button and the volume down button at once) so I was pretty excited. I suggest you read the manual, it's short, and I was surprised at how much they packed in it.\\n\\nAnyway, eager to try out the equalizer settings that were absent on the Taotronics, I tried activating it but it wouldn't work. Then while fooling around with it I found the reason why - the volume down button wasn't working - I also couldn't turn down the music on my phone.\\n\\nSo I emailed them about it, on a Saturday night, at something like 8pm, and forgot about it and drove another 12 hour weekend shift. As I discovered today, apparently they had emailed me back nearly immediately, like within 30 minutes. That's insane. So today, Sunday, I emailed them back with some product details - they responded nearly immediately *again* and told me they were shipping another pair.\\n\\nI'm really exhausted after working this weekend, and I really didn't want to get online, sign in, and write this - I felt like I just didn't have the energy to do it. I really don't trust Amazon reviews as much as I used to, but when a seller is like this you really just have to write a review and reward them for their effort. I mean, it's just ridiculously awesome, and other people need to know about it.\\n\\nSo if you were worried about spending $50 on this headset and worried about them breaking, take it from me, they will take care of you if something is wrong so you can buy with some confidence.","[]","B01M3575QC","B01M3575QC","AHHNH7MJKHARARE676CMLG5TMUEQ","2017-05-22 05:48:18.000","1","True","509"
"537427","5","Works great for what I needed","I was really surprised at how well this worked for the money. I have a 55&#34; LED that I wanted to hand and didn't want to spend a lot as I'll move/replace it at some point. I have a 75&#34;, which has a much more expensive mount with the tilt, pull out and swivel. It's an awesome mount, although it cost 3x as much.\\n\\nI wanted to hang my TV up around 8' and tilt a bit so I could see it from my desk that is about 18' away. This mount achieved this without a problem. With my 55&#34; TV, I could tilt it just the right amount. Given that the mount is pretty close to the wall, I don't think a larger TV would allow that much tilt. Just doing a bit of off the top measuring, a 75&#34; probably wouldn't have any tilt because the mount doesn't come out from the wall more than a couple inches.\\n\\nInstallation was a breeze. The part of the mount that goes in the wall has a level built into it and only takes four screws. I spent more time centering it up where I wanted than actually screwing it in. The two arms that attach to the TV have plenty of options for sizes, so I'd suspect you'd be hard pressed to find a TV that wouldn't fit it. Amazon supplied ample screw sizes and spacers, so I didn't need to search for the proper size outside the purchase. Once you attach the arms, just hand the arms on the mount and make sure the latch on the bottom snaps on. Only way for the TV to then come off without releasing the latches is to slide it all the way off the side (you'd have to intentionally want this to happen). The strings that hang for releasing the latches were a cool little design and easy enough to tuck away out of sight.\\n\\nFor the money, this is a great mount and easy to install. It's very flush, so if you need to get cables in place before hanging (I couldn't get my hand behind the TV once hung, my wife could a bit). As long as your TV cable connections are parallel to the TV, spacing behind the TV wouldn't be an issue. You only have a down tilt, which will be less of a tilt with a larger TV. I would definitely purchase this again for similar needs.","[]","B01KBEOAIW","B01KBEOAIW","AGNRWWSL7GGXASZWGXGLCI3J3LOA","2017-08-02 14:06:05.077","1","True","509"
"101319","5","Great prefabricated box","This is a great prefabricated box for a quick install.  I have a 2017 Ram Power Wagon 2500 (Crew Cab).  The item description says it doesn't fit, but Ram really hasn't changed the Crew Cab at all.  This box does fit.  The only issue I have so far is when the seat is down it makes the front of the box stick up.  I won't dock this a star, as technically it doesn't say my truck is supported.  But once again the Crew Cabs haven't changed.  I saw one other review where their model is listed and it does the same thing.  This company needs to fix that.  I plan on taking my box out when I have time to make some fine adjustments to make sure it stays flat when the seat is down.  Overall, this is a great item.\\n\\nI have the factory Alpine system in my truck.  I had this same system in my prior 2013 Ram 1500 Laramie.  For the life of me I don't know why I didn't do this sooner.  The factory sub is ok.  I guess it's better than not having one at all.\\n\\nI had an 02 Dodge Quad Cab and had a local audio shop build me a box and add a 10&#34; sub / amp to it.  It had been sitting in my garage for 4 years when I got my 13.  I finally had a thought of putting that setup in my 17.  I found all that I needed, but the only thing missing was a box.  The box I had built would have fit in my current truck, but it was made to fit under the passenger side rear storage.  The problem with that is I would have had to remove my folding floor storage and I didn't want to on that side.  We have a Golden Doodle and that is where he sits on road trips.  Therefore, I needed a box for the driver's side storage.  I didn't need the floor storage there.  I found this and it made all of that work.  As for the sound quality, this sounds pretty darn good. So good in fact that I cannot tell if it's any lesser quality than the professional box I had built for my 02.  When I modify it to fit better, i.e. the seat folding down won't make it stick up, I will reseal everything. I do recommend this.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813AhyhbYZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813AhyhbYZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813AhyhbYZL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00IFEBLYW","B00QH1V654","AHY224N7327R7WVP5PZ6PMNQKSNA","2017-08-28 14:26:20.763","5","True","509"

About once a week, the picture frame goes to all blue and freezes.  You either have to shut it off and restart it or pull out the card and reinsert it.  Love it when it's working, but getting to be a pain when it quits!\\n\\nAfter I wrote this review, I was contacted by Alice at OXA USA.  After she read my review, she determined that something was lose inside the frame that I would be unable to fix, and therefore, she was sending me out a new frame.  Great customer service OXA, and I'm glad you monitor what people say about your product.  Pictures are crisp and clear, and I love the frame, so I have high hopes the new one will work perfectly.  Once I try the new frame out I will change the star rating\\n\\nI have now had the new frame up and running for a little over a week, and so far, so good.  Thank you Alice for monitoring the reviews and sending me a new frame.  It appears to be working well.  The pictures look good.  This time I am using the motion sensor, and that is working well and I like it.  OXA certainly stands behind their product, and although the instruction booklet isn't very good, you can always contact OXA customer service and get the answers you need.\\n\\nUPDATE 4/24/17  As of today, I am again having the same problem I did with the first picture frame...it freezes with an all blue screen and a bar on the side.  The only way to get it to work is again to unplug it and replug it back in.  I can see why the frame I paid $59.00 dollars for is now down to $39.00.  This is my second one, and even having it on the motion sensor, it freezes.  I am very disappointed and will contact Amazon - ALICE, I hope you are still reading the comments.  I could see one picture frame being no good, but two of them doing the same thing???  Again, the frame is great when it works, but it's not working very well.  I threw out the first one and I'd rather get my $59.00 back than get another one of these.  It only last 2 months...not a good return on my money!","[]","B01N05YI7R","B01N05YI7R","AEKIXYEJ3OCB6ZX5XRW4UMWHBCYQ","2017-02-22 02:02:31.000","3","True","509"
"992573","5","ZOTAC Geforce GTX 1060 AMP Edition 6GB","This replaced a Gigabyte GTX 650 Ti Boost Edition card. With the 650 Ti boost I had it highly overclocked paired with my FX 6300 at 4.4 ghz, 8 GB of Corsair Vengeance 1600mhz ram, on an Asrock 970 Extreme 4 motherboard. Most newer games at 1080P on a 144hz monitor I would get around 60fps on medium settings. On older games like Skyrim, mmo's, Bioshock Infinite, or pretty much any game made 2014 or before I could play high-very high settings and stay right around 60 fps. Was a good card and lasted me for close to 5 years. I recently bought For Honor, Dishonored 2, Resident Evil 7, Dark Souls 3, Doom, Assassins Creed Syndicate, Prey, and games of that nature. I mostly enjoy rpg's, shooters, and action games. I noticed I had to run everything on medium settings with things like shading/shadows on low to stay over 60 fps at 1080P so was time for an upgrade. I originally intended to get the GTX 1070 but thought a 1060 might be enough for 1080P which is what I game on. My option was get the 1070 or get the 1060 and an SSD to go with it. Choose to try out the 1060 so I could get an SSD as well. Got this Zotac Amp Edition 6GB because it was on sale for 229.99. I've always had Gigabyte/MSI cards this is my first Zotac. I gotta say I'm very happy with it. It overclocked well above my expectations and it stays very cool. With no trouble I overclocked it to almost 1900mhz from mid 1700's. I haven't overclocked the memory yet just the core clock. I went from barely hitting 60 fps on medium settings in new games to maxing out every game I own and getting anywhere from 60fps on very demanding games to my max 144 fps on older or less demanding games. For Honor, Witcher 3, Fallout 4, games like that maxed out or near it at 1080P I get 60-80 fps average. Older games or less demanding ones like Divinity Original Sin, Skyrim, Bioshock series, Final Fantasy 14, Diablo 3, etc maxed out I get 144 fps or more. Would def buy again, only wish the 1060's could support SLI. It is the top card in the picture. The bottom card is a 1070 just to show how nice and compact this card is.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81a+4BU3RSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81a+4BU3RSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81a+4BU3RSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01I5O5AP2","B082HHHHMT","AG7FJZE5AX6ESELOMYHZPK5IHZNQ","2017-05-15 07:39:27.000","7","True","509"
"525495","3","Well made, but browser functions require Microsoft Windows","Very happy with the price.  Was a little worried based on reviews about it being hard to connect, but I did not have any trouble.  The included documentation is incredibly weak, largely from its Engrish nature.  Online support seems to cover about a dozen models that have different features (and the images to help you figure out your model don't match mine at all).  The company web site doesn't help much, its kind of a weird mix of pretty marketing pages that drill down to really weak technical documentation.  But, I found the unit easy to place, well built, the cameras and cables seem to be well made (especially for the price), placing a hard drive in the unit was simple and it doesn't need much power allowing use of a small battery backup for power outages.\\n\\nOddest and most disappointing feature; the unit runs a web interface which lets you use it from any location in the home which is a great idea.  But, it only works with an Active X plug in for internet explorer in Microsoft Windows.  This strikes me as a really weird choice in the age of iPads and Android tablets.  I'll keep plugging away at this to see if I can find a solution and update my thoughts later.  I'll also post details of what I went through in case that helps others later.\\n\\n(an update; triggered by getting an Email question from Amazon and seeing response below)\\n\\nApparently there is some kind of app for phone use.  Doesn't help me, I'm trying to use it from another, non-Windows computer.  So, my comment is still the same.  I wish the unit used well-established open protocols for streaming video and browser use and not a Microsoft specific one or the need for another device/app.\\n\\nAlso, extended use has found the video cables to the cameras to be a real weak link.  My cameras with mostly indoor runs are fine, the cameras with long outdoor runs are all failed at this point.  Consider this with camera placement.\\n\\nI'm leaving my rating at three stars.  This is a fine choice for a very low price point and for someone that wants to tinker and pull cables.  If you are looking for something easier to install and monitor from remote devices you should probably consider spending more money for one of the internet based solutions (Arlo, Wyze, etc.).","[]","B00ZW63ESC","B0C7K81MWJ","AGNXI6ITAWC7LAVX2524ZPZTBDPA","2017-08-13 23:30:50.053","1","True","509"

I really like that you can use SD or USB to play multiple movies, as well as the ability to show the same content on both screens or let them work independently of each other.\\n\\nPROS:\\n - plays DVD and many file formats on DVD / USB / SD - pretty much anything I've been able to copy over it's been able to play.\\n - long cables and fairly easy installation... the hardest part was running the wires, hiding the wires, etc. hooking it up in the car is no problem really, but doing it neatly without power and signal wires all over the place is the trick.\\n - they take a beating... my kids are rough with them and they continue to work fine. also in the extreme heat and cold, no problems.\\n\\nCONS:\\n - they are some unknown brand with very little documentation, no website for the actual product, etc. it's a good thing the installation is pretty easy to figure out because there is some lacking documentation (what they give you is 'bare minimum' but definitely does not cover everything).\\n - some configuration options are confusing... there's a password that is hard coded, which i dont think you can change, to change some of the settings, for example. and another one you do set to change some others. and some settings I just dont understand by the single-word or image labeling it.\\n - the games that come with and it's general ability to play them are pretty weak. it does work, it takes some fidgeting to figure out (the games controller doesnt really seem to ever control them, it's the remote held sideways), and they're slow to respond. will just use it to play videos unless i figure out there's more to this aspect of these. i realize it's a bonus to get the games, but so far they're about worthless. supposedly can also download more and have yet to really figure out how/where/what.\\n\\nI give it a 4-star rating because it's still a great product, my favorite features listed at the top, but a couple of general issues with confusing or missing documentation/information and the sub-par games knock this down. It's a great car video player and kids can catch on to how to use it fairly quickly.","[]","B073JQRC31","B073JQRC31","AG75KKNQEXAKM6XZ7D4PRG2WAVMQ","2017-12-16 21:21:25.015","6","True","509"
"875805","2","Not worth it. At all.","Where to begin...\\n\\nFor starters, I ordered this directly from another website that had a better price. I also own the myCloud Messenger Bag which is fairly similar to the backpack in aesthetics.\\n\\nMoleskine (and other online retailers) do not categorize this as a women's backpack, and I'm not sure how a backpack (aside from a Hello Kitty one) can have a gender bias. With that said, if you are a man, this will look ridiculous on you. Not only is it tiny, but you'll have to max out the strap lengths to get them over your broad manly shoulders. You will look like a grown man wearing a backpack meant for a small child.\\n\\nInternally, there is a fundamental flaw with this backpack. One would assume a backpack stating that it fits 15&#34; laptops would fit a MacBook Pro 15. Not the case here. The padded compartment meant to hold a laptop will not fit a MBP 15. It barely fits in the main compartment where you would normally put a portfolio.\\n\\nThe padding on the straps is a joke. This is a very uncomfortable backpack to wear, even with only a thin laptop and nothing else in it. If I'm wearing a jacket, the straps slide down my shoulders constantly. When they aren't, they are cutting off circulation to my arms.\\n\\nLastly, having to open a velcro flap everytime you want to access the backpack is a huge design flaw. I can maybe see it making sense on a shoulder bag, but not a backpack. I knew this before I purchased it, but didn't realize how annoying it would actually be. In case you are wondering, yes the velcro is absurdly strong and will make a very loud noise when you open the flap. If you go to the library to do work, everyone will hate you.\\n\\nIf you can get past those fundamental flaws and have $200 to burn, the rest of the backpack is decent. Plenty of organization compartments for an iPad, notebooks, stationary, and charging cables. The build quality is okay, but I honestly expect better given the steep price tag.\\n\\nFor the same price you can get a top-of-the-line backpack from North Face that will be higher quality and more functional while still looking cool. In the meantime, I'll stick to Swiss Gear.","[]","8867324543","8867324543","AHK3O7DGZSZKWXSECSX4FC5KHWQA","2017-02-17 04:33:38.000","1","False","509"

I use my desktop to stream my DJ sets to twitch/tv, but use my surface pro 2 to run the actual DJ software. My desk only allows enough room for the computer monitors, DJ controllers, Speakers, cameras, and mouse. As such, I have the surface pro 2 tucked under the desk.\\n\\nWith this slim Bluetooth keyboard I can now type on the surface device wihout having to hunch down under the desk while leaving my setup unattended.

This allows me to easily type in and search for song names, artists, genres, comments/tags/etc. Without stepping away from line of sight of monitors, controllers, chat, etc.\\n\\nThis is also very convenient to have while I setup the same surface device on my shelf where I have it connected via HDMI to a large screen TV. Being about 10 feet away from either desk or bed, there is no convenient way to type on it while streaming to TV. I have been using a mobile app to connect as a mouse and keyboard, but the keyboard on the app doesn't allow for auto fill or swipe typing, making it extremely slow and inefficient to type on. In comes this slim Bluetooth keyboard. Again, works like a charm, and the led backlighting was a must for bedtime use :)\\nI've had the device for more than a couple weeks now, and have forgotten to actually switch off the device many times.

Can not say how long the battery lasts or general quality, but so far has lasted my expectations.\\n\\nPros:\\n+Led back light\\n+Multi-color lighting and brightness\\n+Slim\\n+Recharge\\n+Seems durable enough for normal use\\n+Battery lasts (at least in initial 2+weeks of use)\\n\\nCons:\\n-Sometimes may register single taps on keys as double.

"529720","4","Not as compact as previous tripods, but overall it is built well, is super sturdy, and super durable.","I am an avid hiker and adventurer, so I was looking for a tripod to take with me on my hiking trips. I previously had the Sony VCT-R100 [[ASIN:B000EFIJTA Sony VCT-R100 Lightweight Compact Tripod with 3-Way Pan/Tilt Head]] and that was wonderful. It was small, easy to use, and sturdy enough for what I needed. Unfortunately, one day, will packing it away in a suitcase, I broke off the tilt piece, rendering it almost useless.\\n\\nI then made my way over to this tripod. I am a big fan of Sony gear, as I feel they are high-quality and durable. So, buying this tripod was an easy decision. My first time using it was in ZIon National Park. I wanted to shoot the night sky so I whipped this bad boy out. Let me say, this was NOT super intuitive to use. I was unfamiliar with the system to lock the camera onto the tripod, so I struggled to secure the camera. I am still not a fan of the camera mount, as I don't like the design. You have to remove a piece from the tripod, screw that piece into your camera, and then re-palce the piece back onto the tripod. Not intuitive.\\n\\nSecondly, I found this was a bit bulkier and not as easy to carry around as the previously tripod. Yes, this one was much sturdier and I was confident using it even in the wind, but it was a little too big for my comfort. That's not a knock on the actual tripod, moreso a personal preference for my use.\\n\\nOverall, I actually found this tripod to be much MORE than I needed. It is sturdy, extends tall enough for me (I'm 6'3&#34;), and all of the levers/knobs/screws lock into place. Essentially, you can place your camera at any angle and it will lock in. My only knock on it is that it doesn't fit in any sort of backpack. I've attached pictures beside my full-size backpack, and there is not a chance you can fit this in there. This would not be a good tripod to use if you're looking for something compact or easy to use. I recommend this more for the serious photographer who is going to take pictures in easily accessible places with not a lot of movement.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Mrhq6DB6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Mrhq6DB6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Mrhq6DB6L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dHyAXRsDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dHyAXRsDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dHyAXRsDL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71htTfofgyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71htTfofgyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71htTfofgyL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00006IRS3","B00006IRS3","AF2NSE2OYE7PXC5IEFLW5IVNHKWQ","2017-10-30 21:30:03.510","3","True","509"

And the $90 purchase was steep for this little thing, I really  can't purchase anything else at the moment, so I have to tolerate this tiny grating sound from this little speaker, until I can get something with a better speaker. I had a Grundig from many years ago, a pocket radio, and the speaker was much better sounding , unfortunately, the tuning malfunctions now on the LCD screen and the radio stations drift badly,  they won't stay tuned on the am frequencies, so that's why I purchased the C Crane.  For the price I paid for this radio, I can't give a high rating.  The other functions are fine, but the speaker more than anything is  somewhat a dealbreaker for me.\\nAs of 5/25/17  I am revising my rating upward to 4 stars. After investigating more of the features on this radio, I came to realize that I could improve the voice quality using the bandwidth  button, and also pressing and holding the tone  button to switch to voice  or music setting, which for talk radio, the voice setting is better but the speaker quality was much improved after setting the bandwith in increments from 1 to 6, the lower you go, the better the voice quality for talk radio and, thus, is now more tolerable to me. Level 3 turned out to be pretty good.\\n I apologize to C Crane for not fully checking out the features for voice quality; the bandwidth feature helped greatly. I still think the price for some of these little radios is just a little too high.\\nUpdate as of 4/20/20. When holding the radio while walking, the sound often goes off. Have to hit the unlock key, turn radio off then on again and relock.  Still not high enough volume overall.  Much too pricey of a radio.","[]","B00QMTI6YK","B00QMTI6YK","AEVNX6AJID3S75SKMGMIIF4SM6YA","2017-05-17 23:06:56.000","2","True","509"
"268981","5","Works Well - ResMed AirSense 10 (S10). Great Spare Power Supply!","Used on a ResMed AirSense10 (also called &#34;S10&#34;) CPAP.\\n\\nThis adapter was an emergency replacement for my original ResMed adaptor (see specifications below). The device failed suddenly without notice. I have since learned this is common, and use after two years is a bonus. At 11 PM I went to various CPAP web stores and discovered most would not be delivered until the middle of the following week; expediting costs were almost equal to the high price of the adapter itself! On a whim I went to Amazon and found this adapter with prices slashed. I ordered at 11:30 PM on a Thursday.\\n\\nThe adapter was received second day delivery (on a Saturday at that!) via Prime. Excellent order processing and delivery time. Packaging was acceptable and no damage. I plugged in the adapter and my CPAP fired right up. I tested it through the ramp, hose and water heating, and &#34;full load&#34; of the CPAP without a hiccup. Again, this is a preliminary test so I have no idea of the longevity of this power brick.\\n\\nSpecifications:\\nThere are many devices on the web that do not work with the S10 CPAP despite their claims. You need proper diligence to be assured your new power supply will work. So, here are the specs of this device. Yours CPAP brick should be similar.\\n\\n - SINGLE PIN connector to the back of the CPAP (not the three of many ResMeds)\\n - Input: 100 - 240 V AC ~1.5A\\n - Output: 24V DC at 4A\\n - Comes with the 120V U.S. style wall plug pigtail that connects to the power brick (missing in the picture on Amazon).\\n\\nOther Thoughts-\\nThe converter itself is smaller than the original ResMed. This may mean fewer windings and, thus, poor life/performance. I don't know this for certain, but is something to think about, especially at the low price I paid.\\n\\n*** At a minimum, this power converter should be purchased as a backup given the high odds yours will fail after two or so years. ***\\n\\nI will update my review if performance/life is unacceptable.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UWqu3EH6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UWqu3EH6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UWqu3EH6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pGgghqvoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pGgghqvoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pGgghqvoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810PTPXgiJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810PTPXgiJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810PTPXgiJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AWTiPQASL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AWTiPQASL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AWTiPQASL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Xp1jn0p8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Xp1jn0p8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Xp1jn0p8L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B071CKDFHG","B071CKDFHG","AG4VR54TRW2BZG6WRIGM6ADSGBVQ","2017-06-17 16:27:13.453","24","True","509"
"779290","4","Coverage is pretty good, 5 bars if I'm close to the ...","I've been using this TP-Link AC1200 Gigabit Switch, Wireless Wi-Fi Router for just over 6 months, and I haven't had any major issues.  Coverage is pretty good, 5 bars if I'm close to the unit, 3 bars in certain locations of my house.  My house has two levels with just over 1300 sq ft on each level.  If I am on the lower level, coverage is generally better (that is where the router is located).  I've played around with the antennas, but I couldn't work out the coverage.  I've also tried using different channels, but that didn't seem to work.  It's possible that the number of walls and the amount of sheetrock and wood that the signal has to travel through is impeding me just a bit, but it's not a deal breaker.  If I use the 5 ghz band, I can still transmit at my maximum internet speed, which is 75 Mbps (limited by my ISP).  Occasionally my speed will slow down to 20-30 Mbps, and if I restart the unit, this fixes the problem.  Have to restart about once a month--I'm not sure if this is an ISP issue, or an issue with the unit, or both.  I also get a solid 3 bars in my backyard, and 1-2 bars in my front yard.  So, overall my experience has been a solid 4 stars, which I don't consider to be bad.  I would still buy this unit again, but I probably wouldn't brag about it to someone looking to buy.\\n\\nOn a side note, a major factor for me picking this unit was the gigabit switch which is built in because I have fiber-to-the-house, so the potential to upgrade to 1000 Mbps speed is there.  Sure, there might be more expensive routers out there that can handle more devices and higher speeds, that an an internet-speed aficionado might recommend, but this device would be adequate should I decide to up my speed in the future.  Also, I have a couple of my devices running over Cat5e, which makes the gigabit ports that much more useful.\\n\\nOn a second note, I've used Cat6 cable to test transfer speed instead of high quality Cat5e, and for network transfers I can't discern a difference.  But then again, I'm not trying to set world speed transfer records either.","[]","B01IUDUJE0","B01IUDUJE0","AE2HW3RZXBKBJO5USZLITQ4QAY7Q","2017-04-20 16:07:17.000","1","True","509"
"98075","4","Pretty good.  Would recommend as a cheap way to get into 4k.  But are you ready for 4k?","I took a gamble on this monitor because my local shop had a couple in stock that I could see.  I probably would not have ordered this off of Amazon based on reviews alone.  But it's not bad.  The build quality was the weakest thing about this display.  The stand seemed reasonably heavy but the threads were stripped in one of the holes to mount the stand.  I guess this could have been my fault but this wasn't my first time using a screw driver.\\n\\nTips for buyers:\\n\\nUse the display port cable (included) and not HDMI or DVI.  If your computer does not have display port, 4k is not for you unless you have the newest version of HDMI.  My computer immediately recognized this as a 4k monitor and assigned a 60 Hz refresh rate.\\n\\nSpend time calibrating color.  This display needed about 30 minutes of work out of the box.\\n\\nTips for 4k noobs generally:\\n\\nBut can it run Crysis?  My GTX 750ti worked well with this display but there is obvious room for improvement in gaming.  If you plan to game on high settings, be sure that you have a GTX 1070 or AMD equivalent.  Other than the video card, my system is enthusiast grade (4790k, z-series MOBO, 32 gb RAM, Samsung pro SSD).  If you are running weaker hardware, YMMV.\\n\\nImages and videos are beautiful by comparison to my previous monitor (which was no slouch). You get lots of extra real estate with 4k.  Be prepared to be able to have 3 full pages of a word document displayed side-by-side or a word document and two smaller windows next to it.  For productivity, 4k is pretty amazing.\\n\\nHowever, in my limited experience very few things are optimized for 4k.  Websites in a full screen window will have either all of the text on the left one-third of the window or in the middle one-third of the window.  You will need to do some tweaking to get text to display properly (large enough and heavy enough) and, even after tweaking, some things just won't seem to work properly.  Of course, this is no fault of the monitor but it is a problem with being a relatively early adopter of 4k.","[]","B00SX4WQ2A","B00SX4WQ2A","AHIPEY4SGGPNMDP7FNFTMJNPXS3A","2017-01-28 16:15:31.000","1","False","509"
"468800","5","Solid, powerful, quiet","This has worked great for me, and I'd highly recommend it as an embedded network appliance at the price point. I've tried it with both pfSense on FreeBSD and Ubuntu Server on Linux, and all hardware seems to work natively without any rough corners or weird drivers.\\nSince I imagine most people are going to use this as a network appliance and not generally have a display connected to it, the serial COM port (and included RJ45 to DB12 cable) is a fantastic benefit that you rarely see in consumer network hardware. It gives full access to the device's BIOS setup interface and most OSs' boot consoles, and makes setup and network troubleshooting far easier than the traditional approach of repurposing a keyboard and monitor, or the embedded router hell of resetting and praying for a default network configuration. I was able to install and configure pfSense from scratch without connecting a display or keyboard. Ubuntu required video to do initial setup, but could be configured to support the serial console shortly thereafter.\\nThe chassis build quality is solid, all the ports are flush and well aligned, and access to the DIMM slot, two mSATA slots, and SIM slot (still unsupported in the US? See the Q&A section) are accessible under the bottom panel with four screws. There are pre-drilled and grommeted holes for installing antenna, though the options for equipping this device with wireless hardware are somewhat limited, so you may want to look elsewhere if homebrewing a WAP is part of your plan - the only officially supported wireless card is a USB based 802.11a/b/g only device.\\nIt comes with a bracket for hanging this off of a standard monitor VESA mount, but since it's so ill equipped to drive a modern display, I can't anticipate that this would be useful. I can see no reason why you couldn't use it as a wall mount bracket, though, as this device would probably be pretty well suited for hiding in a network closet somewhere.\\nThe link, activity, and HDD LEDs are all clustered on what I would vaguely consider to be the &#34;back&#34; of the device - the side with the DC in and network ports, where one is likely to have the most wires plugged in. This makes it mildly inconvenient and ugly to position the device where these LEDs are actually visible, but whether this is something you'd even want to do is mostly a matter of preference.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512ZfzRoAZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512ZfzRoAZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512ZfzRoAZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Vu-Wlp-4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Vu-Wlp-4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Vu-Wlp-4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gkOFmcjSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gkOFmcjSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gkOFmcjSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B072ZTCNLK","B09X69JY9J","AH2Q7EETEMNU3OHCQOW4XIR2THSQ","2017-09-20 21:58:10.746","14","True","509"

I have had the Companion 1 512 since launch and have loved it, I was so excited when this machine was announced.\\nMy first MSP 512 bricked in 72 hours- total hardware failure, and I had to return it.  After a lot of BSOD's, reinstalling Windows, trying to update drivers between BSOD's, it finally stopped turning on altogether.\\n\\nAfter that, I have had 2 machines that both had screen problems.\\n\\nThe screen flickers considerably at 0-25% brightness.  Every machine I've seen- 4 of them (one belongs to a friend)- does this.  If you want to extend your battery (btw the battery life is very short- maybe 2-3 hours) by reducing the brightness, be ready for the screen to flicker nonstop.  There is also an issue with the screen will flicker ever so slightly if you hover your stylus over it on a mid-to-dark gray background.  I paint a lot of landscapes so it was very noticeable to me while drawing, and very irritating.  If you draw comics or do 3D, you will likely not notice it.  But I've found it's most noticeable with the gray background in Adobe Bridge (it happens no matter what program you run, it's the value/color that matters- you can't see it on just white or black).\\n\\nI want to keep this machine, I want to love this machine- it's beautiful!  4K resolution! 16 gigs of RAM!  But first and foremost, it's a painting device- which it is flawed at.  Wacom is king of drawing devices, which has been so hard believe they released this with these issues.  How did Wacom, makers of Cintiq, make a flickering screen?  How did they allow the screen to flicker around the stylus?  Like I said, I've seen 4 of these machines, and every one of them has these flaws- so I'm going to assume most of them, if not all, do this.\\n\\nSuch a bummer.  Maybe they'll make a new version with these issues corrected, as I don't think the hovering issue could possibly be fixed by software updates.  If they do, then they can keep my $3,000.","[]","B01M5BBZ2E","B01M3UERZD","AHHW6H75VCA3ICJJ2DHPD3MAAL7A","2017-02-23 20:38:07.000","6","True","509"

S health couldn't see it until I downloaded Samsung Gear, which for some stupid reason, was NOT included in the bloatware on my Samsung Galaxy S5. Go figure.\\nThe watch is heavy and feels well-built. The bezel and touchscreen are very responsive, and having the buttons on the wrong side isn't really as big a deal as I worried it would be. While the photos online make the face out to be physical, it really is a screen, and the brightness can be adjusted.It can also be changed to a handful of other faces, and more can be downloaded. The band is very comfortable, and a bit on the large side, considering I'm built like an Amazon (no pun intended). While I was dinking around with it, two texts and an email popped up, and I accessed them easily. I also found that I can connect a bluetooth headset to the watch itself, which would be handy if I ever found a reason on God's green Earth to walk away from my phone. So far, I've loaded music and photos, set an alarm for weekdays at 5:15 am, changed the face to a blue one and called my husband and daughter multiple times, just to annoy them.\\nThis watch is supposedly water resistant, so we'll see how that goes this summer, because humidity in Iowa.\\nI do wish I could answer calls through it, since I did pay $300 for that darn thing.

"554172","2","Logitech Z623 Speaker System: Poor Quality, Known Problems, Short Lifetime","The Logitech Z623 speaker system has been around for a while, and has at least a few known issues that remain serious problems. One is the power button: After a while, the electrical connection behind the power switch may start to fail. This has been reported in many reviews. Pressing or touching the power button results in loud &#34;crackles and pops&#34; emitting from the speakers. The power connection is unstable, rapidly turning on and off, due to the faulty switch under the button. It is very difficult (and eventually impossible) to simply turn the power on at this point. This renders the entire system inoperable unless replaced or properly serviced. Service requires taking apart the speaker (likely to cause at least cosmetic damage due to design) and replacing the power switch or solder to the switch.\\n\\nNote: Logitech does not service or &#34;fix&#34; items with warranty claims, but they may eventually send a replacement. They will literally tell you to throw the faulty item in the garbage, like a piece of junk, not worthy of fixing. Unfortunately, these replacements are usually refurbished units, probably from in-store returns. After the replacement is provided, they will not provide further service or replacements.\\n\\nThe price of the Z623 system is tempting, and the sound quality is definitely adequate before the failures set in. But customers should know that due to various issues with the quality of the workmanship, the system is unlikely to last more than a few years. I have purchased a couple over the years, and had a couple replacements provided under warranty. None of mine have remained working for more than 3 years. One was faulty right out of the box. Average lifespan has been around 2 years. This is unacceptable and frankly pathetic for a device of this kind, that are either powered off or not in use 99% of the time. Coincidentally...) The warranty for the Z623 is currently 2 years, but is subject to change.\\n\\nMy rating for the Logitech Z623 speaker system: 2 out of 5 stars. One star for each year it will work until its inevitable failure. Avoid. Please do not reward companies for producing poor-quality &#34;throw-away&#34; items at too-good-to-be-true prices. Please do not reward companies for who are unable or unwilling to fix known issues after years of reports and data.","[]","B003VAHYTG","B01C6ESQM6","AGCDMXEFHDDJ6Y2WQZ3MRJR3JZWQ","2017-12-19 07:28:41.679","0","False","509"

Not only is my framerate very high (above 80 for most games on ultra settings,1080p) but the card runs quiet and cool. Games like PUBG, Elder Scrolls, CSGO and Crysis all run like a dream. Not much difference between this Gigabyte 170 card and the MSi card, the msi card just card looks prettier and has a backplate. No difference in performance. If you want a better looking card, go with the msi 1070, but if you're like me and don't care about looks too much, the gigabyte card is the right choice since you'll save some cash.\\n\\nI will write another review once i try out my system on a 1440p, 144hz monitor since this card can run that resolution very well also. This card is a little bit overkill for the 1080p, but since i plan on upgrading to running 1440p in the near future, that's why I paid more for this card instead of a 1060. As far as 4k, this card can handle it, it's just that you'll sacrifice your framerate and get more like 26-30fps. For 4k, definitely get a 1080 and some solid cooling.\\n\\nOverall this card crushes any game I throw at it. Only cons would be that it doesn't look as pretty as the other 1070's.\\n\\nUpdate: 5/5/2018. It’s been almost a year with this card and I must say I’m impressed. No issues whatsoever yet. I also upgraded to a 1440p 144hz monitor and I can still run any modern game with 80+ fps easily. I also overclocked this card slightly using MSI Afterburner and it does get a little but hotter but nothing major.

"632199","4","Great Watch Battery Life Could Be As Advertised.","Overall the watch is fast, nice looking and feels great.  The GPS and heart Monitor are pretty accurate.  The only issue I have is horrible battery life.  This device is advertised as being a device that can be used for 24-48 hours.  I have the watch set to only receive text and phone call notifications.  With the screen always on I went from 100% to 50% in a matter of four hours.  A update was pushed to the device this morning but I believe it was probably the October Security Patch.  Anyone who has used Android Wear before knows that updates are always behind.  Compared to my Huawei Watch 2 this thing is 90% better.  The battery drainage is why I say 90% better.  To be fair the battery in this device is small compared to the Huawei Watch 2 as well.  With the display off I managed to get over 8hrs with still a lot of battery left. The only feature missing is NFC which is not a big deal for me especially since my credit union does not support Android Pay.  The watch faces on the device are good enough that will satisfy many.  Overall I am pleased this watch exist.  But please please please fix the battery issue.\\n\\nUpdate:\\n\\nRecently I have been experiencing issues with the watch not notifying me of text or calls even though all the settings were right.  I am currently using a Pixel with Android 8.0.  I have been in contact with both google and Mobvoi who have both been helpful.  I have done just about everything possible to get the issue fix including a factory reset on the watch.  Today I uninstalled and reinstalled android wear on both devices to see if that will fix the issue.  So far it seems to work as it should but I'll give it until Friday to make sure.  Mobvoi has acknowledged that my device may be defective and has suggested I return the device to Amazon which I started that process as well.\\n\\nIf anyone else is having the issues I have described please notify Mobvoi so the issue can be addresses.  It's possible people may not even notice that this is occurring when it happens intermittently.  Far as battery life it has improved with the watch dying and recharging a couple of times.\\n\\nEven with the issues my rating is still high.  Besides the issues listed above overall the product is good.","[]","B076HMN6ST","B076HMN6ST","AEV5Q2MIJQV6OA5C4WVLKFHTX6LA","2017-11-19 17:43:30.726","82","True","509"
"132971","4","Disappointed, but hopeful","This is my first purchase of an Anker product and my first purchase and use of bluetooth headphones. I was really excited to use them for the gym. When I received the SoundBuds they worked perfectly, and I really enjoyed using them. They helped me just ignore everything around me due to the noise cancellation. They sounded great as well! But after 2 days the light turned red when I was using them and it turned off. I tried multiple times to turn it back on, and the lights would not even show. I was disappointed because I thought they were great and wanted to continue using them. I did some research online and found that other people had similar issues and had some luck by plugging them in other USB Ports and holding the power button multiple times, but it didn't work for me. I tried everything I could think of and they still would not turn on. I charged it the night before and on my Iphone the battery symbol for the SoundBuds was full before it shut off for good... I had high hopes for this product, but after 2 days of use... it won't turn on. I really do like the product, and I currently have a ticket open with Anker Support. I will update my review if it is a pleasant experience. Thank you for reading my review!\\n\\nUpdate 1: I submitted my ticket to Anker Support on Sunday the 29th of October, and received an email with my ticket number at 12:00 AM.\\n\\nUpdate 2: At 9:37 PM on 10/31/17, I received communications that I had received a faulty pair and will be sending me another pair to retry along with a prepaid shipping label to return the faulty pair.\\n\\nUpdate 3: I had to return my pair before they sent my my replacement pair. I sent it in on November 4th, I waited till November 6 and did not receive any communication from Anker Support so I emailed them and they said they would send my replacement pair.\\n\\nUpdate 4: November 9 I received my replacement pair,  it took about 11 days for me to get another pair due to the one that I initially received being faulty. It is disappointing that I have to wait so long because I bought the earphones and had them shipped in 2 days because I was excited to use them. I am updating my rating because although there was a delay, atleast support was helpful through it.","[]","B0721MP41Q","B0721MP41Q","AE7BQ6VFDA2CD5T5LWNPGP6WFOXA","2017-10-31 17:05:41.134","1","True","509"
"235658","4","Nice tracker, but can be quirky","I really like many features of this tracker.  It seems to track steps, miles, heart rate, fairly well most of the time.  Previously I had a first generation vivosmart, but I had to return it for a replacement when the screen failed.  In the interim I purchased this upgraded tracker (refurbished) to try it out, and have kept the first generation replacement as a backup band.\\nThis band has worked well most of the time.  Occasionally the heart rate goes wonky, or the button doesn't take me to the extended menu.  At that point I perform a restart by pressing the button for a few seconds until the screen shows power off.  After it is powered back on again it works well.  This morning the touch screen stopped working, e.g. it wouldn't respond to swipes or touches, so I was unable to power off the band.  As instructed by online trouble-shooters, I unlinked the tracker from my phone app, then pressed the button on the band for 30 seconds, at which point it turned off.  When powered back on the touch screen worked fine, and I relinked it to my phone without any problems.  It has worked fine since then.  The only other issue I have is that the heart rate sensor leaves quite a noticeable square depression on the skin of my wrist.  Since the battery lasts about 5 days, and since it charges quickly, that depression doesn't have much time to recover.  I try to change the position on my wrist periodically.\\nSo other than having a few quirks, I really like this tracker band.  However, only time will tell....\\nUpdate 5-23-17:  Well the band finally locked up and wouldn't restart after several hard resets. Luckily it was still under warranty, and luckily Garmin has a great replacement program.  I'll get a &#34;new&#34; refurbished band by the end of next week.  This is still my favorite band despite it's quirks.  According to some online forums, the lock up problems might be caused by very slight leaks of moisture into the band, so I won't continue to shower with it on in the future.  We have extremely hard well water, that eats away at many brass PEX fittings, so it wouldn't surprise me if our water ate away at whatever makes this band &#34;waterproof.&#34;","[]","B01HFIEFLE","B01HFIEFLE","AGS3XEI3SMELAWYS7DQY7K3572DA","2017-04-14 20:38:25.000","7","True","509"
"836206","2","I want to LIKE it, but I just can't","So these headphones...has a LOT of potentials, but it falls short. Honestly, I want to give it a higher rating, but I just can't do it. Here are my ups and downs for this headphones:\\n\\nStyle: Right off the bat, love the looks. The logo is not obnoxious, it's simple and the light makes it stand out. I get lots of compliments when I wear these.\\n\\nShape: Not a big fan of the overall shape. I prefer headphones that really hugs around your head (for example, V-Moda Crossfade) and not make your head look bulky (like Beats). Because of the shape, it doesn't really hold on to my head too well.\\n\\nDurability: The top plastic part that goes over the head started to snap and I wasn't doing anything vigorous.\\n\\nFeatures: The touch panel is the BIGGEST downfall in my opinion. The idea of changing music and adjusting volume with a simple swipe is cool and all, but it's too sensitive. Sometimes I accidentally touch the panel, and it really messes my groove. Even if it's not by hand the music might pause or skip. And it'll take some practice when you actually WANT to use the panel (I tried swiping to skip to the next song, and it registers as pause and etc.). I think a flat button panel could easily solve this issue.\\n\\nLights: I love, love, LOVE the lights. Being able to adjust them on your device with the app is pretty awesome. HOWEVER, (and this is really me nitpicking) when changing the color of the light, it's not a smooth gradient transition, but more of a &#34;click&#34; into another color. I feel like these headphones will look more futuristic if the color changes smoothly. Also, I really wish I can turn on the light even if I'm using the headphones with a aux cord. The power button and the light switch are not separate, so once you turn it on, it automatically goes into Bluetooth search mode.\\n\\nI really want to like this headphone, but it just has too much cons that outweighs the pro. I really really REALLY hope the developers will see my review and make a 2.0 version of this product. If they fix all these issues, I'd DEFINITELY buy them again.","[]","B00WBSSVDW","B07CX3MDNY","AHEBSSOZX2AYD6K5MHLWZCAXYFMA","2017-12-19 06:42:17.527","2","True","509"
"656576","4","The One","Prior to building this PC the last PC I built for myself was 10 years ago and I knew I was long past due for an upgrade. At first I was most decidedly going to go with the Intel i7700k. As you can see though I ended up going with a Ryzen because I felt like it was a no brainer. Good performance, good price, and the AM4 socket will continue to have high potential.\\n\\nSince the release of Ryzen I was looking for stable motherboards for my own build. This new architecture has throw some manufacturers for a loop. I've always used ASUS mobos but after seeing numerous complaints from consumers about ASUS's AM4 mobos I knew I had to look elsewhere. I chose the MSI B350 TOMAHAWK because the price is right and also because of the positive customer reviews on both Amazon and Newegg. While some here say they've received dead boards (probably user error in most cases) the general opinion thus far is that this one is a winner and I have to agree with that.\\n\\nMy Ryzen build with this board went so smooth, everything was plug and play and went together nicely. When the time came to finally push the power button, and bring this beauty build to life on factory firmware and settings, I had let go of a sigh of relief. No hiccups at all. Since then I have updated to the latest BIOS version, got my Corsair Vengeance 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 3200 (PC4-25600) C16 RAM running at 3200MHz thanks to the suggestions in one of the reviews, and overclocked my R7 1700 CPU up to 3.5 GHz. She's stable and beautiful, and the  Corsair Vengeance 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 3200 (PC4-25600) C16 with the red LEDs look really dope with this mobo.\\n\\nAll that said, I still can't give this board 5 stars though. I would have liked additional USB ports available in the rear I/O panel, but I can use a PCI add-on card for additional ports. I also wish there was more than the single M.2 slot available on the board, but I know that would have made this board more expensive also.\\n\\nTo summarize, if you're looking for a good value mobo that won't let you down this is the one you are looking for.","[]","B06WVFFXXL","B084LT1FJT","AEUSSFXJ2CGZACC5ILVAP5FOPVNA","2017-05-29 14:11:02.000","9","True","509"

I had my Operating drive replaced with a 512 Samsung pro m.2, and my hard-drive replace with a Samsung 500 evo SSD.\\n\\nThe only laptop that compares to this is the razor blade pro. In my opinion this is a much nicer machine that the razor blade pro. If you have the money this seams to be the best single GPU laptop made.\\n\\nThermals= The Aorus has yet to thermal throttle on me. While running AAA games like PUBG it only uses about 60% of the CPU and GPU during play at ultra settings. I have yet to see above 75°C when using this laptop.(I do use the included standoffs for more airflow).

"580597","5","Superb sound!","My best sounding headphones by far are the AKG Y50BT, which came with the $99 Samsung promotion.  Their frequency response curves are sick; basically flat across with accents just where you want them.  Such excellent lows, and balanced very well.  Mid - excellent.  Highs -\\n excellent.  Way, way better that 20hz to 20khz would suggest.  But I can't wear them long.  They're not uncomfortable.  I can wear them longer than other non in-ear headphones.  I actually thought they were light when I first tried them.  But I can't tolerate non-earbud headphones very long.\\n\\nUseful headphone reviews need comparison.  The Samsung AKG OEM in-ear, Advanced Model 3, and AKG Y50BT are my 3 go-to high-fidelity headphones.  I get different things from each, and each are brilliant in their own way.\\n\\nI love the Model 3s, but these beat them in every category except comfort.\\n\\nThat said, Model 3s have a powerful low end and high highs (on part with in-ear AKGs),  They're convertible wired to wireless.  Sub is almost too powerful, which can mask the bass on some songs, but they're otherwise pretty well balanced.  Soundstage is not as open as AKG in-ear, but bring a different dimension in hi-fidelity sound.  They sound like high-end monitors when you get a good ear bud fit (silicone works much better than foam for me).  And they're bluetooth which frees me when doing chores where the cord doesn't snag every few minutes.\\n\\nI also want to acknowledge how excellent the Galaxy S8+ original AKG in-ear buds are!  Excellently balanced with a nice low end and excellent high end (I can't distinguish highs from these AKG Y50BTs), beautifully engaging and open sound stage, no fuss fit, great sound seal without being isolating, anti-tangle cord... I could go on and on.  The in-ear AKG's are so good and very underrated, despite their decent reviews.\\n\\nStill, AKG Y50BTs are better in almost every category except comfort and soundstage (openness).  $130 is a very fair price for the sound you get.","[]","B01BX72RUY","B01BX72RUY","AESVQGGQCYBNB6NKHPQHZW7BWGRA","2017-09-05 08:16:36.237","2","False","509"
"410527","4","Love em, they’re great. Comfort/Audio 5 stars, gave it 4 for crappy foam and high price to replace ear pads.","At first they sounded too bright with hi hats being too prominent. After 50hrs listening so far with trance/rock/jazz/classical/madonna and prince type pop music, I can say that they represent the audio very good to excellent. The feeling of a live performance is there with lots of soundstage, separation and detail. I thought it needed a tad more oomph in the lower frequencies, although when testing some bass test tracks in Tidal, it hit the spot. Mastering is what it comes down too. If you expect the same bass that 2 x 10 inch subwoofers will pump, out use an EQ :) A quick note, 1980’s/90’s rap sounded aweful due to the mastering; eg. Baby got back by Sir mix a lot sounded central. Tone Loc was a bit better. Modern rap/pop like Bruno Mars/Lil Jon, not really my music go to, but for test purposes, sounded spectacular. Drum solos give a nice representation of highs, mids and bass, and the HD800S deliver truly.\\n\\nVS the HD650, they’re bout 2.5 times better; after going back and listening to the 650’s.\\n\\nFor full enjoyment of your tracks, listen to at 65-80% of the maximum volume you can handle.\\n\\nThe only thing that I didn’t like is that while your ears don’t touch the material on the inside, I feel that over time (quickly) the foam used will become less spongy. Sennheiser needs to use a latex type material like those used in Tempur mattresses, maybe even with leather covering, rather than the microfiber material. Replacement pads cost $165 AUD - for foam and fabric, really? The fabric I don’t mind (just don’t use with hair product or when sweaty/hot) but the foam is inexcusable at this price point. The HD650 foam was/is crap with barely any rebound and flattened quickly. These feel like they’ll lose that density rapidly.\\n\\nI use the Cardas Clear High Speed USB cable with the Burson Audio Conductor V2+ (amp/dac). When testing amps in store, the Burson outperformed the Sennheiser and Marantz amp in the same to higher price range FYI.","[]","B00PXLX2TC","B00PXLX2TC","AFLF2M7LTQIOBLWEMOAKIYSCADLQ","2017-10-17 04:50:44.905","3","False","509"

In spite of doing maintenance to try and keep it unclogged and up-to-date it is so slow, it's become nerve-wracking. It takes minutes to open websites. And even opening Shop Amazon, which one would think would be a priority & extra fast, takes forever. This is a lousy tablet which takes all the fun out of it. It is mindboggling to me how Amazon could have come out with such a miserable product ! If you buy it, it should be shipped with Tums and/or Rolaids !!!\\nOriginal review:\\nI just can't give this tablet a satisfactory review. Yes, it is cheap. And because the price is so low, &#34;corners&#34; must have been cut. This tablet may be good for some. But I really wish that Amazon would take all the reviews criticizing the numbingly slow speed under consideration and come out with a faster and superior version of this tablet at a higher price that would reflect the improvement in speed, efficiency and productivity. Surely I am not the only one willing to pay more for a better and improved Fire HD8 tablet. If Amazon would come out with such a tablet, I'd be amongst the first in line to order one. I could then and only then really love this tablet. Please Amazon, hear the complaints about the slowness and do something about it !!!!!!!\\n\\nI have this very attractive tablet for 7 months. Use it mainly for reading, browsing an shopping Amazon Prime. Good size, well built. while it was adequately fast at the beginning the one huge negative now is that it is very, very, very slow. I use CC Cleaner to keep it &#34;unclogged&#34;, but it's not helping much. At times it takes up to 30 seconds to open up the New York Times or Washington Post. I do not expect it to be as fast as my iPad Pro (which I totally love); it's not even close in the price-category. But even for for the very low price the Fire HD8 should be a bit faster. I haven't found info yet for a solution to get it back to a reliably acceptable  speed. If I could, I would love it !

"111855","5","Dell thought of everything on this one","Dell thought of everything on this one:\\n\\n1. The monitor has 3 DisplayPorts, two regular size and 1 mini-DisplayPort. The mini-DisplayPort can be an input, from your computer or an output to daisy-chain to another monitor. One regular DisplayPort is always input and the other is always output (for daisy-chaining). The included cable has a mini-DisplayPort connector on one end and a regular DisplayPort connector on the other end. So you can plug it into a Mac by plugging the regular DisplayPort cable into the monitor and plugging the mini-DisplayPort connector into your MacBook. Or you can plug the mini-DisplayPort connector into your monitor and plug the regular DisplayPort into a graphics card on your computer.\\n\\n2. The monitor has a USB hub in it and a cable to plug into a USB connector on your computer. Plugged into this monitor is my USB camera, USB headset, USB mouse, and USB keyboard.\\n\\n3. The monitor can be raised or lowered on a track. At its lowest, it is 14 3/8 inches from the desktop. At its highest, it is 19 1/2 inches tall. It can be rotated to the point that you can have it in portrait or landscape position. In addition, you can tilt it forward and backward. Basically, you can position it in any position or angle you want. Nice.\\n\\n4. The image is beautiful: Its crisp, clear, and with brilliant colors. The monitor is viewable from almost 180 degrees which keeps the brightness constant as you move your head and each eye is seeing the same image.\\n\\nI am using this with Windows 10 and with a Radeon R9 280 graphics card (its my son's previous gaming computer). I don't use this for gaming and I understand this technology which makes the image beautiful does not make for a fast monitor. But if you wanted a monitor for gaming, you would be using an HD (1080p) monitor, not a 4K monitor... 4K monitors have 4 times the number of pixels that need to be manipulated by your graphics card and this taxes even the best of the cards. So you won't be using this monitor (or any 4K monitor) for serious gaming.\\n\\nBut for everything else, this monitor is hard to beat.\\n\\nWayne","[]","B00PC9HFNY","B01NAHJFI0","AHQ6ABSTTZ5DTCSNSQFCWU2ISJWA","2017-04-10 04:15:36.000","3","True","509"

Only problem with this distance is Wifi thieves, and I was having that problem. But I stopped him form doing it anymore, with this router you can go to the website and block all new devices from connecting to the wifi. Very Nice. Since I blocked all new devices I haven't had any problems with those low-life wifi thieves.\\n\\nUPDATE: I have dropped my rating down from 5 stars to 1 star.\\nI have been using the default user name, but now I am having problems with someone trying to use my wi-fi (again). So I wanted to change the user name... well come to find out that you can NOT change the user name. So that means that everyone that has this router, also all have the same user name. So how many thousands of these things have been purchased. 10,0000, 15,000? Well that's how many people also have the same user name. So, that is one less thing someone needs know to have access to my account. That is really dumb. They need to re-think this and allow people to have there own unique user name.\\n Another reason I dropped to 1 star is the fact that if you purchase wireless cameras for security around your house, all video is stored with netgear. You can't just save to your own devices or PC. It is saved to Netgear (threre own cloud type thing,) So if someone gets into the videos I saved to Netgear, they can watch them. Really stupid. I don't want anyone to see or know what is going on in or around my house but me. I am sure that Netgear would say that only I can see what I have saved, but think about it, if someone can hack government computers and hack the cloud, they can hack this company. So if some perv could be watching kids playing in the pool. Or someone locally could see when I leave my house so they can break into my house.\\n I used to think this was a really great router but now I will never buy another Netgear product again.\\n The router is fast and gets good distance, but that is the only good thing I can say about this router, but when it comes to privacy, huge negative.\\nI DON'T recommend this to anyone.","[]","B0192911RA","B0192911RA","AGJW233OCVIDP34ZLSCVN4OFLSSA","2017-04-07 17:24:41.000","2","True","509"

This thing exposes every option you could possibly want in the most convoluted possible way.  For some bizarre reason, fairly rarely used settings like RADIUS sit at a top-level navigation item in the configuration while &#34;everyday&#34; things like changing the WiFi password require you to go to wireless section and then there's a &#34;security profiles&#34; tab where you have to create or edit a &#34;security profile&#34; and then you have to go back to the WiFi interfaces and then select the network you want to use (which doesn't look like a hyperlink, but it is!) and then apply the security profile you've created.  Why they didn't create an option to drop a simple network key from the WiFi setup baffles me to no end.  It's abstraction upon abstraction upon abstraction.  But if you ever wanted to create multiple security profiles, each with separate keys, and a different cypher each with different rotation schedules, hey -- you can do that with this router.  Every.  Single.  Networking.  And.  Wireless.  Option.  Is.  Exposed.\\n\\nPower:\\nThis thing has a full watt of power, and it definitely feels like it.  I can pick up my signal about half a block away in a dense urban location.\\n\\nForm factor:\\nIt's definitely not going to win any awards at an art show, but it's very functional.  White and boxy means it goes just about anywhere.  Vents for heat.  It's got a USB port on the side.  Power, PoE/Ethernet plugs are all conveniently located.\\n\\nPrice:\\nGreat price.  There are routers that are easily 2-3x the cost of this that do half as much.\\n\\nOverall:\\nAs others have said, this thing is a beast in terms of functionality but if you're not considering a career in networking, it may be worth spending more to get something that's easier to set up and has more common options exposed more up-front and hides away settings you'll never use.","[]","B00JO48OP6","B00JO48OP6","AH3MK3FNKAVC2KSA4YYQKLRQJMHA","2017-12-28 01:20:00.710","2","True","509"
"470966","2","Unreliable and Inaccurate Times","Unfortunately it seems the Circle has been launched without being fully developed and it hasn’t worked for us as it should.  It’s clear that the usage and history don’t match up, ie. my son's allocated time was up in &#34;Usage&#34; but it was clear he hadn't spent as much time as it said he had.  We then went to &#34;History&#34; and manually counted each time a certain app appeared and it was significantly out.  For example Snapchat appeared in history 22 times (ie 22 minutes of use) but the Circle stopped his access even though his Usage allocation was 45 minutes.  While customer service was very helpful, they were unable to find any reason why it’s inaccurate, or resolve it.  Unfortunately this means the Circle has no credibility with our 15 year old son and rightly so - it is not doing what it claims to do.  Not only that, it makes things more difficult as he can challenge any notification from the Circle by claiming it’s probably not accurate anyway.\\n\\nThere are some very clear issues:\\n\\n1.  The minimum period counted is one minute so even if a single notification comes in from Snapchat, that single notification is counted as a minute of use.\\n\\n2.  Facebook and Instagram in some cases are counted as the same thing so this affects the time limits set for both and means neither can be relied upon;\\n\\n3.  In our case, the history recorded when compared with the usage (both data provided by the Circle, not estimated at all) clearly do not match - they are out by a significant amount.  At this stage we haven’t found a reason or solution.\\n\\nMy son has good reason to ask us to stop using the Circle as it’s causing more problems than what it is solving.  We have had to agree with him.\\n\\nI’m disappointed we have spent the money on the Circle but have only had issues with it and have decided we're no longer able to use it.  While the concept is fantastic, and the device may be helpful for younger children who are not so switched on to ensuring they get the time they’ve been allocated, it seems that it has some further development required before it’s as effective as it could be.","[]","B019RC1EI8","B019RC1EI8","AEL42XNFCYTTBWGONP5PJKPH77WQ","2017-12-01 18:09:21.384","3","True","509"
"883404","4","Works just fine, a couple of little things","We have our office on the third floor of our home, and so it's hard to hear the door bell. After some research I decided on the iseeBell. It arrived within a couple of days, Packaging and presentation was Apple-esque, neat and very complete. Upon unpacking I quickly paired the video doorbell to our hime WiFi via the downloadable iseeBell app.\\n\\nI then installed the video bell on our front door. I removed the existing conventional doorbell, connected the two existing wires to the video bell (didn't need the supplied power supply), then securely screwed the video bell in place. Tested it with the iPhone app and it worked right away.\\n\\nNext I plugged the supplied indoor chime into a centrally located power outlet in the house and used the simple instructions to pair it with the video door bell. I then selected from one of the many available chime tunes and set volume. I will probably order a couple more indoor chimes for other parts of the house and office (you can connect up to three; extras cost a bit over $20 each).\\n\\nThe good news: everything works just fine. The phone (and even my Apple Watch) alerts me when someone is at the door. I can see on the phone who it is and I can talk to them via two-way communication. I can also leave the camera on so I can see what's going on outside the front door.\\n\\nWhat needs some getting used to (and the company may fix/change): the lens is extreme wide angle which means sort of a fish-eye perspective. It has to be that way, because whoever rings will stand right in front of the camera. Audio is iffy, as you'd expect from a small device outdoors. So you have to speak slow, loud and clear. Perhaps the biggest immediate problem is that folks who walk up to the door can't really see the ring button. It's black on the black background, with a faint blue music symbol on it. Most think it's just a surveillance camera. iseeBell should definitely make the ring button more visible.\\n\\nSo technically it all works fine. Since iseeBell communicates with the cloud, you don't need to be on your home WiFi to see what's going on. As long as you have a data/internet connection on your phone, you can see what the camera sees from anywhere.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B8aKeCkRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B8aKeCkRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B8aKeCkRL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eKUDYXlkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eKUDYXlkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eKUDYXlkL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fYsJt0owL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fYsJt0owL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fYsJt0owL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vDf1+Uc6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vDf1+Uc6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vDf1+Uc6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01MYXF7P3","B01MYXF7P3","AHYXPHIJEKRNLXWRJXZ4CS6ZDXNA","2017-08-14 19:24:41.413","66","True","509"

Went to the Crucial website and it listed this as a compatible (and recommended drive, then went to Amazon to order it.  Shipped quickly and arrived in good shape.  Downloaded Acronis software for Crucial, hooked up the drive to a USB-SATA cable, and ran the cloning program.  Or at least tried...\\n\\nAcronis said there was no Crucial drive present and stopped running.  Went into Win 7 and it recognized the drive, but unformatted.  Called Crucial CS and after about five minutes, CS emailed me a &#34;workaround&#34; program to run.  No mention that this was needed &#34;on some systems&#34;.  Ran it, then ran Acronis again and it recognized it.  So far, so good...\\n\\nStarted running the cloning program and was told it couldn't clone because the existing WD hard drive was 512 Bytes/Sector and the Crucial is 4096 Bytes/Sector.  Called Crucial CS again and explained the problem.  They confirmed that the cloning won't work; that the Bytes/Sector need to match.  The ONLY recommendation they had was to do a clean install of Win 7 and ALL of my programs (MS Office, etc. - over 100 programs)!  Wasn't happy, given that it is a real PITA to do that and reconfigure all my office products and other programs again; not to mention having to call Microsoft to explain a new drive and deactivate the licenses so I could re-install.  Crucial CS also doubted I could use Win 7 Backup and emergency repair disk.\\n\\nNowhere on the Amazon or Crucial site does it mention this little &#34;catch&#34;.  They both just say how wonderfully easy it is to replace and use Acronis cloning software.  Neither site mentions the Bytes/Sector, either.\\n\\nNot sure what I am going to do, but will probably return the Crucial drive and find another brand with &#34;hybrid&#34; technology with 512/4096 Bytes/Sector.  Believe WD makes them, and probably others.  As it is now, it is worthless to me.","[]","B073W4N5KB","B07D89NHV4","AEZEPWQSNBMPYXTEFGCOPSAMYUDA","2017-12-23 16:15:45.743","1","True","509"
"378400","5","Not expensive, easy solution to expand storage capacity of you MacBook (different versions and manufacturing year)","I have been looking for sometime to expand capacity on my MacBook Pro 15&#34; late 2014 version. There are two solutions available and I choose JetDrive Lite. Below is explanation why:\\n1. Price\\nJetLite Drive 360 256GB version has very good value versus capacity. I belie the best you can find.\\n2. Jet Lite Drive is recognized by macOS as separate drive and you can see icon on your desktop and not like other brand when card is integrated with your existing Mac SSD to create bigger internal drive and shows as a bigger one drive - simply as RAID 0. In that case you will never have control where you data are written - in case of failure you can lose important stuff. This is not a big issue if you are making regular backup but most of people doesn't. I would not relay on this kind of setup and Jet Drive Lite give me full control when I want to put my data - SSD or JetLite Drive.\\nI could put the name of other brand because when I did my review was rejected by Amazon due to some rules in guidelines. If you will search you will find what brand I'm referring to.\\n\\nSome reviewers complain that when MacBook is woke up then they can see this drive even with Jet Toolbox installed. I'm using this already 3 months and it happens only 2 times. I just remove and plug back again and problem solved. I'm using macOS Sierra and beside this 2 times never have problem with this drive and for longer time I didn't even installed Jet Toolbox tool.\\n\\nHint: if you bought this one you will of course use with your MacBook. Before first use just format to OS file system and Time Machine will backup also this drive when performing regular backup of you MacBook.\\nSummary: easy solution to expand your MacBook storage (for example use JetLite in your iTunes as default storage for all your music). Even 2 times happened that Drive wasn't visible when after MacBook woke up I still give 5 stars because this drive gave me 256GB more space and working as describe.\\nAlways make sure that you buy right version of JeLite Drive based on type and year of production of you MacBook.\\nGo to Transcend web site Consumer Products - Apple Solution - JetDrive Lite where you can find table and choose right version for you MacBook.\\nOn the same website you can find many different solutions to expand your MacBook storage capacity.","[]","B00WGARJGU","B00K9ZS12A","AH5KOYXODOQMRKDKF3NSAZH53WKA","2017-01-14 22:24:41.000","1","True","509"
"704960","3","UPDATED - Wireless connectivity fixed!!","It SHOULD be a great laptop, but it's not. It should be blazing fast compared to the 4lb brick it replaced, but it's not. I opened it, set it up, and connected it to our Wi-Fi so that I could get the necessary Windows updates. Four days later... still downloading (1 foot away from the router). My husband said to send it back-- clearly this was not the machine I'd expected. But I was reluctant to pay a restocking fee and figured I could tweak the settings once everything was set up. The answer is NO. The settings could not be &quot;tweaked&quot; to fix a connectivity problem that likely stems from defective hardware. Our internet speed is fine. Every other device in the house is fast. This lovely machine brings me back to the dial-up speeds of my youth.\\n\\nGiven the positive reviews, it sounds like this laptop is hit or miss. If you want to take a chance on it then I wouldn't buy it from Amazon or from any seller who is going to charge you a restocking fee to return it.\\n\\nUPDATE: After several hours on the phone with tech support and sending it to Acer support twice (with them finding nothing wrong), I was incredibly frustrated. I plugged in my Ethernet cable and did some intensive Googling. Here is the problem: this laptop has wireless-AC and my router is a cheap Verizon Fios router with Wireless-B/G, that is 802.11B, 802.11G. (I just found this out now!) Another Acer laptop owner posted this solution somewhere and it worked for me. I unplugged my Ethernet cable and did a speed test on Speakeasy. My download speed went from 0.5mbps to 19.6mbps!\\n\\nGo to Settings &gt; Device Manager &gt; Network Adapters. Scroll down and right click on Qualcomm Atheros and select Properties. Go to Advanced tab and click Wireless Mode on the bottom. Use the drop-down menu to change the Value to match the wireless type of your router. I looked up my router on Amazon and scrolled down to see the specs. Look for &quot;wireless type.&quot; If your router is reachable then you should be able to see this on the label. It is nuts that Acer support didn't know to try this. I hope it helps!","[]","B01LD4MGY4","B07H9WYL9D","AEQCZVIPSCXLZN3AWESXLT7AMBYA","2017-06-30 13:56:39.896","10","True","509"
"866095","4","Not as great as people say, but there is a fix.","Bought two of these so I could couple them as a stereo pair.  They sound great together, but nobody ever mentioned that you can only use the stereo pair function from a bluetooth source.  The aux line in is not compatible with the stereo function.  Also, the bluetooth has lag, so I can't use this as stereo tv speakers because peoples lips are out of sync with what they say and it looks and sounds weird.  The line input has no lag, but I can't use that for stereo, so no way to get a good lag free stereo sound from my TV with this.  As far as a single unit goes, it sounds good, but it is mono.  I can't abide by having a mono bluetooth speaker this day in age.  Bose needs to add a second driver and put one on each side of the device!  They also need to let stereo pairing work for aux audio sources.  Until then, this is not worth the money, and I regret buying it as half of my intended use for this was as a nice speaker system for my home entertainment system that could double as a portable speaker in a pinch.  Oh well.  Three stars.\\n\\nUpdate:  I ended up getting a stero male to two female mono 3.5 mm splitter cable, and two mono male to male 3.5 mm cables.  Using this and putting it in aux, then equalizing the volume by lowering them all the way and raising them one notch at a time (the light blinks with each volume level) you can get a good stereo setup using the two of these.  There is also a firmware update that you can use through the phone app to update the revolve through bluetooth to fix both aux input and usb input lag.  They each have to be updated through the app separately, one at a time, and can't be in party mode as the update option will never show in that mode.  So I have added an extra star because it sounds great!  However, all the trouble I had to go through, and the fact that the product is not clear that it will not pair with another revolve for stereo wireless mode unlles the input is bluetooth, loses it one star overall. Also, there is still bluetooth lag, but bluetooth as a format itself -tends to have lag on highend audio streams, so can't really fault it for that. Four stars.","[]","B06XCYGH1C","B06XL1GKRV","AHSXXMAGDH2Q4BHWQZSLRNCYUAOQ","2017-07-02 02:39:22.714","36","True","509"
"672386","4","A Solid Rig If Your Equipment Is Not Too Heavy And You Have An Average Body Build","I am very fortunate to have a job that allows me quite a bit of world travel.  This review is based upon using this product in both South Korea and New Zealand (about 35 days of continuous use).  When I travel, I like to take two cameras with me: Canon 6D wearing a 24-105mm (IS) Lens and Canon 7D Mk 2 wearing a 70-200mm (IS) Lens; both cameras are fitted with battery grips.  While my configuration 6D is not too heavy, the 7D is a beast.\\n\\nBefore purchasing this rig, I read review comments that the supplied plastic attachment stud came lose during use.  My initial thoughts that this problem was a result of users not tightening the screw enough.  I was wrong!  While I was in Korea, I learned from first-hand experience that this is in fact a very valid issue if you use heavier equipment.  In spite of using, a gun-smiting screwdriver to make sure the mounting stud was tight, within 30 minutes of walking, it had come lose, which made it difficult at best to remove the camera from the rig.\\n\\nPrior to my trip to New Zealand, I decided to modify how my cameras are attached to the rig.  To do this I purchased the aftermarket metal attachment studs and two MH 621 Quick Release Systems.  I used Loctite to assure that the mounting studs did not come lose from the MH 621 system.  This new combination worked perfectly.  I had no problems with the studs coming lose in New Zealand.\\n\\nThere is one additional observation to make.  While, the rig provides a considerable amount of adjustment to accommodate most body types, if you are tall like me (198cm), your cameras may ride higher up on your torso than you may like.  Obviously, this is a personal preference, but I would like more adjustment in the shoulder straps.  If you are average in height/body build this should not be an issue for you; however if you are tall and or robust in build you should consider this observation.\\n\\nSo, would I buy this rig again knowing what I now know?  Probably, however given how I use this harness and my size, I would consider the much more expensive harness with which this rig competes.  If you use lighter equipment and are average in size, I would wholeheartedly recommend this product.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Nf8OyDJVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Nf8OyDJVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Nf8OyDJVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QPsYpG-hL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QPsYpG-hL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QPsYpG-hL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00GP34H6Y","B00GP34H6Y","AFDW3TAQ7X3R65TTVWWSOHRCAEBQ","2017-02-05 03:27:38.000","6","True","509"
"401318","5","Perfect Lens for Nikonians","I received this lens on 07/06/2017 and I love this tiny jewel very much. Of course, getting first impression of it's specs,I was a little skeptical, because  the lens is not fast. I use to have Tokina ATX 12-24 mm, F/4, Pro, then Tokina ATX 11-20 mm, F/2.8 Pro and was not fully satisfied with both of them.\\nFirst was good, but I needed more wide angle than first one had and sharper image than 11-20 was giving to me. It was very obvious when I was using 20 mm setting..I was dreaming of getting Nikon 10-24 F/3.5-4.5 DX Lens, but that was too expensive for me. I have few prime Nikon's lenses including 10.5 F.2.8 Fish Eye Nikkor Lens which is fantastically sharp with awesome colors and contrast and I needed Ultrawide, matching somehow in quality of image with this one. Using Tokina Lenses I had to (mostly) avoid using aperture less than F/5.6, or even F/8 for achiving pretty sharp (but NOT very sharp images. And finally I decided to not think about fast aperture, if lens has Vibration Reduction. My Nikon cameras are D7100 and D3300. Both of them can work with new auto focusing system of 10-20 AF-P DX VR Nikkor, especially after firmware upgrading  Therefor i stopped  on: this new Nikon ultrawide, which cost about 40% less than each of my Tokinas (I already traded one of them) 10-20 mm, 4.5-5.6 AF-P  DX, VR Nikkor is making me really mad. I want to use it again, again and again. It is perfectly sharp, silent and (seems to me) has not much of distortion at 10mm and almost none of them at 20mm. 20 mm is may be the sharpest setting , although 10 mm is sharp as well. Price is fantastic $307, lens is very light. I disagree with some of opinions I read that this lens is for &#34;not professionals&#34;. If professionals are using DX format cameras, this lens will serve them perfectly on D500 (for example) and D7500, D7200 and D7100. It will work with D810 in DX mode too.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RNwNMxVEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RNwNMxVEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RNwNMxVEL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aHBQX9FXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aHBQX9FXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aHBQX9FXL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fCwoF659L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fCwoF659L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fCwoF659L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ksn7EttpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ksn7EttpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ksn7EttpL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81C2SNcTJCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81C2SNcTJCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81C2SNcTJCL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81IqQtHKCyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81IqQtHKCyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81IqQtHKCyL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SrOcsWIQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SrOcsWIQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SrOcsWIQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WqiHaT8uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WqiHaT8uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WqiHaT8uL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WyS47dX-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WyS47dX-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WyS47dX-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aSBLfcyhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aSBLfcyhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aSBLfcyhL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yvKaUOtSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yvKaUOtSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yvKaUOtSL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91AJsahHaFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91AJsahHaFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91AJsahHaFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91EV+it4C3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91EV+it4C3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91EV+it4C3L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B072639587","B077XMWV75","AEN5XFQ7XYZZDKZLCXYZSZOLQISA","2017-07-25 00:54:25.611","27","False","509"
"426325","5","Insane value for the price, great bass, stay in ears just fine","Full disclosure, I obtained these on sale at Costco for $60, but since Amazon is my go-to location for reviews, I figured I'd post mine here. Sound on these is head and shoulders above other earbuds I've used in the past (Klipsch, Skullcandy, Sennheiser). For the price I paid, the results are mind blowing. The clarity is excellent, and it makes a huge difference for my overall listening experience.\\n\\nI'll specifically note my observations on a few things that I questioned based on reviews:\\n\\n- Some reviewers think &#34;there's no bass&#34; or that the bass is &#34;weak&#34;. I have not observed this. The bass is quite strong and tight, not overpowering, loose and drowning out everything else, it seems like it's exactly where it should be. I tend to like things slightly on the bassy side, so I was concerned, but my fears were completely unwarranted, and so are yours, if you're concerned about this aspect.\\n\\n- I've also seen reviewers note that these &#34;don't stay in their ears very well&#34;. I plan to use these primarily while sitting at the office, so I was prepared to deal with this. However, despite my ear canals, which rarely seemed to cooperate with earbuds in the past that did not include some kind of extra mechanism (i.e. over ear wire/clip) to hold them in, these stay in my ears quite well. I don't plan to do any running with them, but it certainly wouldn't concern me if I did plan to, they fight in my ears quite securely and there are plenty of sizes of silicon and foam (I was surprised, too - foam!) to choose from.\\n\\n- These things completely shut noise out, like ear plugs; I can't hear a thing with them in -- that may be either a pro or a con, depending on your perspective, but it's a fact. Previous earbuds I've had have not been this sealed off from the outside world.\\n\\n- The controls worked great on my Galaxy S7\\n\\nBottom line, you won't touch the sound quality these things offer in this price range -- if you're on the fence, you should definitely get a pair.","[]","B01KB9K9Z0","B08RTN8KZC","AE5UXUXCSFS333SVURCYRV5WXHRA","2017-01-19 01:55:17.000","1","False","509"
"170898","5","almost perfect!","I have seriously been looking for a stand for my laptop for-e-ver. Years ago, I asked my husband to build me one, because I couldn't find one I liked/that worked for me, and of course he never did. So my laptop (the biggest MacBook Pro they made 5 years ago) has been sitting on a box and some old books (see first photo).\\n\\nSo, when this came available in Vine, I jumped on it.\\n\\nWhen it arrived, my first impression was: wow. That's so huge! I also thought that it would be nice if they had built the stand with side compartments on both sides, not just one.\\n\\nHowever, after I set it up, I was thrilled! (see second photo) It's a good height & size (though another 1/2 inch taller would have been great). I have to use a special keyboard for my carpal tunnel, and even set up (literally; it doesn't lay flat) the way it needs to be, the drawer pulls out easily and the keyboard will go under.\\n\\nI like that the drawer holds a lot of stuff and pulls out easily - it certainly opened up some space on my desk! (Sorry I forgot to put stuff in the drawer before I photographed the 'after'.) The side compartment is pretty useful too. After setting it up, I realized that side compartments on both sides would probably not be useful because your laptop most likely has cords coming out of one side for power, USB, etc.\\n\\nIt seems very sturdy, and I like that the little feet are rubber so it won't scratch your surfaces.\\n\\nMy only suggestion is that you be able to switch the drawer around so that the side compartments can be on the left side if needed. My Mac's cords come out on the left side, so compartments on that side would be useless/covered up, but my HP laptop cords come out on the right side. There are stoppers on the drawer so you can't switch the way it sits, but it also keeps the drawer from going too far on the other side and perhaps damaging a wall or falling out entirely.\\n\\nAt the current price of $18, it is well worth it. (I think I would pay up to $30, but not the full price of $40.) 4.5 stars","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717bWufKGVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717bWufKGVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717bWufKGVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zk+WC+rAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zk+WC+rAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zk+WC+rAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01NGU1YTZ","B08XD4N3K4","AFN6LOTWEBLAAI7HNDFZGISN4DUQ","2017-07-19 17:33:44.062","8","False","509"
"204257","1","Blood Vessel Bursting Frustration and Sleepless Nights","It comes in a nice box... and that's really all it has going for itself. The Sabrent USB 3.0 SATA Hard Drive Flat Docking Station (Model EC-DFLT) is made of cheap, flimsy plastic and contains just one tiny set up manual with just one and a half 2.5&#34; by 4&#34; pages of documentation per language. Did I say documentation? I meant very basic technical specs and a picture guided setup instruction.\\n\\nI tested this device on three different PCs. Two using Windows 10 and one using Windows 7. I tested three HDDs and two SSDs across all of those devices. While the drives were present in Disk Manager, they were not accessible for any type of process beyond looking at the amount of storage on the drive. I went to Sabrent's website and was disappointed to find that not only is there not a GUI based application to pair with this device, there are also no drivers and just one firmware update to theoretically support drives over 4TB.\\n\\nI made a support ticket online with no response. I searched for drivers and firmware - nothing. Google search concerning the issue brought me to support topics on 3rd party websites full of people with the same issue - nothing worked. I called tech support FIVE TIMES and was handed over to an answering machine the first four times I called during business hours. Really? An answering machine for tech support?\\n\\nThere was a glimmer of hope when a real person's voice answered my fifth call to technical support. However after just a moment of speaking to the guy I realized I was not going to have my problem resolved. This guy was worthless. He had no idea where to start troubleshooting my issue. Our conversation was over in thirty seconds, and it went like this: &#34;Is it plugged in?&#34; &#34;Is there a hard drive in the enclosure?&#34; &#34;Is the light on?&#34; &#34;Okay, send it back.&#34;\\n\\nThis hard drive enclosure is priced in the middle of the road among other enclosures. The lack of documentation online or in the box, absent driver support, uninhabited tech support wings online and over the phone, and the extraneous tech support experience I eventually received has officially made this the worst tech purchase I have ever made.","[]","B00LS5NFQ2","B098VHF5X1","AGXUU25OIHX3B7Z5KEFJBAAFJOMA","2017-01-23 23:16:15.000","11","True","509"

Again, it's a recommendation...but be forewarned:\\n\\nSetting this thing up with my standard wifi network was next to impossible.  It just didn't work for a good 45 minutes before it magically &#34;worked.&#34;  Seriously, magic must have been involved cause I can't tell you how many times I had to reset this thing, enter passwords, etc... before I had the routine memorized.

It just doesn't...no.\\n\\nI've also had syncing problems with the Aria.  It'll go from working for a month straight everyday to....not syncing at all.

It does provide a decent BMI counter.  Also, the weight measurement is fairly accurate, although if you fidget or lean even in the slightest it can get off quick.  So, it's sensitive, but if you prepare yourself before getting on it'll report accurately.\\n\\nI don't regret the purchase at all, but it's a pain in the *** sometimes.

"120528","1","Should Be Renamed the ""DumbPlug""","This product is absolutely terrible. I work in a technical field installing custom audio and video systems, have about 40 years of experience with computers, building, repairing, etc., so this isn't a lack of knowledge issue. I'm using the LG SmartThings hub with Alexa for voice control, Philips Hue lighting, a Honeywell Lyric thermostat, and a few miscellaneous things. The first time I got this &#34;Smart&#34; outlet, it took literally about 4 hours to get it to work. I had emailed their tech support department explaining my attempts to get it working using both a Nexus 5 and a Lenovo tablet and the only suggestion I got was that I &#34;needed to use an iOS or Android device&#34;. I'm pretty sure the Nexus 5 phone, being a Google phone, the company that owns Android, is an Android device. The boot screen on my Lenovo Android tablet also indicates that it uses the Android operated system, so this wasn't much help.\\n\\nI did finally get it working after resetting the device about two dozen times and re-entering the activation code many times more that that and it worked up until yesterday when I changed my WiFi device. Every other smart home device and app I had easily synced back to the new WiFi, but the iHome app could not locate any devices. Half a dozen resets did not result in anything new. I finally unplugged the device and left it all day while I was at work, returned this evening and plugged it back in. After resetting it a few more times, it finally appeared in the app. I thought it would be okay then but after entering the code (a nuisance on its own) and it scanning my WiFi, then entering my password, and it scanning some more, would not pair to the Wifi.\\n\\nYou can see in the photo that the outlet has a solid green light, which is supposed to indicate that it is connected to WiFi, but it isn't in the app. The next photo shows the error on my Android. Perhaps if it starts turning things off and on by itself, it'll mean a neighbor is controlling it, because it isn't on my WiFi.\\n\\nPersonally, I think iHome should have saved the money they wasted including a useless remote control with the product and put that money into engineering a device that worked reliably. I would give this zero stars if I could.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/516zr5LCLhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/516zr5LCLhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/516zr5LCLhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517hZHPCPML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517hZHPCPML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517hZHPCPML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01HCVG51M","B01HCVG51M","AFC63TP7S6OMYWWNUDQWJH6YYI6Q","2017-01-26 00:08:25.000","36","True","509"
"977009","5","Solid system","This system can be thought of in 3 parts – setting up the cameras, setting up an online account, and setting up the app:\\n\\nInstallation of the cameras and getting the video on the monitor screen is easy. The cameras run on wifi, but they need a power cable. The video is crystal clear and the colors are great, really impressive. Even in the dark, the video is clear using the night vision. The video lags by about two seconds, but it is not choppy. We set up all four cameras in the house – the idea being that there would be no false alarms with the motion detection when we’re not home.\\n\\nThe system needs an online account so you can access it from your computer or phone. The account takes a little time to set up, the instructions aren’t the clearest, but still not too hard to follow. It took us about two hours to set up an online account, e-mail alerts, and beep alerts. The e-mail notifications run through Hotmail because Gmail is blocked in China. However, these aren’t too valuable because Hotmail will prevent the system from sending e-mails thinking they are spam. The beeps are loud enough to wake you if you set the box near your bedroom when you’re asleep.\\n\\nThe mobile app is powerful, but takes some time to figure out. You need to set up an account for each mobile phone with which you want to use the app. Once we got the app figured out, we could receive notifications on our phones when the motion detection was triggered, which was great. We can turn the alerts on or off from the app with just a few clicks, which is critical since we only want the alerts on when we’re away. Using the mobile app we can see our cameras from anywhere, and the video quality on the phone is excellent. There’s still a little lag, but the video is not choppy at all. From the app we can also save pictures and video clips directly to our phone.\\n\\nOverall we’re impressed with this system. We wanted something that would give us good quality video and remote motion detection alerts, and this does the job. We have had the system running for a month now, I hope we’ll never have to rely on it, but I have confidence it’ll work if we need it.","[]","B01H5DBQSY","B01H5DBQSY","AEZBNW5M3PNILV2XIJ3IBZJCEVFQ","2017-01-15 04:45:06.000","0","False","509"
"224643","4","Very happy so far","Recently had to replace our router.  Tried a high end Asus router.  Was very unhappy with it.  The mesh technology was suggested to me by a friend.  The Google version was the least expensive option of the three brands that seem the most reviewed.  So returned the Asus and bought this.\\n\\nPros:\\nVery easy to set up.\\nOffers some simple parental controls. (pause kids devices)\\nUses a phone app to control.\\nProvides nice seamless coverage throughout the house.\\nSpeeds are very good and consistent (in areas I have designated as important - see related con below.)\\n\\nCons:\\n-Offers limited advanced options, so may not be for network techie people that really want to tweak and control all settings.  Wasn't a factor for me.\\n\\n-Can ONLY be controlled from the phone app.  (I would like to be able access from my laptop if needed.)  Had it lock out my phone when I played with pausing kids devices, even though my phone wasn't on the list to be locked out.  Since I had not set up another phone or device to be the administrator, I had to reset the entire system.  Still haven't figured out exactly what went wrong.  Possibly user error, but I don't think so.\\n\\n-Signal strength is not as strong as they advertise as far as coverage per unit.  I have 3 units and need all three to cover my downstairs (2800sf  2 story house) due to walls, I guess (they suggest no more than two rooms separation between units - ie 2 walls it seems.)  If there were any heavy users upstairs I would need at least one more to provide really good coverage upstairs.  It does have a signal upstairs, it just is not as strong as I would like.  But for my current usage patterns, this isn't a huge problem right now.  Would advise keeping it in mind and planning ahead when you buy, depending on your setup.\\n\\n-only one lan connection on each unit.  Not a huge deal, but did require the purchase of a simple inexpensive switch unit for the main office placement to run  some hard connected devices.\\n\\nDespite being more verbose on the cons, I am happy with this router system and would recommend it.","[]","B01MAW2294","B08V2MLHLN","AHU4VLVJ2ARS4GLAZLMXIWOEYS5Q","2017-04-03 16:43:52.000","1","True","509"

"803447","3","on my second battery after six months , terrible motion detect and poor night vision. App is slow to respond.","I have only used my the arlo pro for six months. Night vision is definetly nothing to brag about, pretty poor visibility. Disappointed by the overall motion detect on this.. I played around with the alignment and have motion detect at 100%. Only seems to be effective about 15' out. Also, the biggest kick in the pants is the battery... I could not find anything documented about battery life.  Simply says it varies depending on temp and usage. So when I was comparing cameras and re searching different ones I guess I overlooked that little piece. I assumed the actual battery life would last a while with multiple charges . Clearly I should not have assumed , we all know how that saying goes.  Well I now know the batteries will last 4-6 months and it has to be replaced. Mine lasted 3 months and took about 4 hours to charge , lasted another 3 months and is now dead. Just purchased a second one. So that's 50$ roughly for battery replacement every six months. Of course the life varies they say by heat and usage. Ok , but who buys a 250$ camera just to step down the video quality to squeak out a few more weeks on the battery. Complete garbage is what it is and I feel this is an overall gimmick by netgear to squeeze dollars out of you. I am disappointed by Netgear as a whole. Customer support is a joke as English is not a language understood. After a long wait time and I spent the bulk of the conversation saying &#34; I'm sorry, can you repeat that&#34; and the 15 minutes it took her to type out my email. Eventually got the customer support tech to say the batteries are &#34; no goodafter 6 months&#34;. WTH netgear! Normally I love netgear as I have there Nighthawk router and modem. I did not mention much else as regards to features and quality of pic as they are basic and fit my needs and expectations for this price range. App definitely takes about 30 seconds or more depending on wifi or cell service with iPhone 6 to load and then view live feed. I will say Nest or flir fx cameras are superior in pic quality and night vision. However , arlo app is free so .. a bit of a trade off I can live with since their is not any reoccurring fees. * UPDATE- may have been misinformed by tech support on overall battery life, moving from 1 star to 3 star for now.","[]","B01LR8PG52","B08739SDH3","AEOCA2RFQTQ2YCLZBSQR6HSNTLVA","2017-06-10 21:21:24.331","0","False","509"
"277440","4","Worth the extra cost — be careful with those bolts","After experimenting with various styles of vehicular mounts for my Surface Pro 3, I've settled on this one. The build quality and nearly endless range of adjustment justify the price; it's definitely a case of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.\\n\\nThe only issue I've had with this product has nothing to do with the product itself; it was a real challenge to loosen a seat rail bolt in my Subaru Crosstrek, and I'm a strong enough dude. I wound up repeatedly smacking a socket wrench with a rubber mallet, which did the trick. A steel pipe slipped over the wrench's handle would've provided the necessary leverage, but I worked with what I had on hand. Hopefully I was able to safely tighten the bolt.\\n\\nUpdate - 8/17/2018:\\n\\nI sold my tablet some months ago, but discovered an alternative use for this mount that I'd been struggling to find another device to accommodate. By rotating the ledge flat-side up and removing two &#34;fingers&#34;, I have an ergonomic shelf for my portable HF transceiver. I can bungee or belt the radio to the platform, butting the back panel against the fingers, which adjust to accommodate cabling. I was previously limited to operating the radio in its carrying case, with everything sitting on the passenger seat or passenger's lap. Inconvenient and unsafe while moving. Now I just unstrap the radio and pop it back in its bag when I reach my destination. This wouldn't work with a heavier radio, but it's a slick solution for portable rigs or anything with an external control head. Great when no purpose-built mounting kit exists and/or your cabin is as small as mine.\\n\\nAnd some bad news: I'm sad to report my mount suffered a catastrophic failure after very little use. I'm sure the problem had nothing to repurposing the device for a radio, and everything to do with me applying excessive torque to the adjustment lever for the joint between the two arms. It didn't take much force to strip the sleeve-like aluminum nut that threads onto the stainless bolt inset in the lower arm. I wish they'd used steel hardware across the board. I plan to contact Arkon about spare parts, but I'm reluctantly prepared to eat the cost of a replacement for this mostly excellent product that meets a unique requirement of mine.","[]","B007AQK2CI","B08J8GGN7B","AHZAOZTL2DX45SAWB27BHPJIQ4ZA","2017-01-05 19:00:46.000","1","True","509"

The KTXPRO1 has been around for decades and I've used them even way back when they were sold by Radio Shack. These Porta Pros I never tried though, since I was such an avid fan of the KTXPRO1. The Porta Pro has been said to be KOSS' most popular headphone even more so than the KTXPRO1 that I love still to this day.\\n\\nSo I got a pair of these and as I thought...  wow they are great too as well. It has that same very warm, broad, spread sound that the KTXPRO1 has, balanced non tinny sounding highs, deep bass, with a very thick and rich mid range. There's no weakness when it comes to the sound quality from Koss. I feel I might be able to even wear these even longer than the KTXPRO1 which were also very comfortable too as well.\\n\\nTo the critics,\\n-These are not Bluetooth headphones\\n-These are not noise cancelling headphones\\n-These are not closed back headphones, they are open back\\n-These are not around the ear headphones, they are on the ear headphones\\n-These don't have memory foam or leather ear cups, they are standard foam\\n-These don't have a remote and mic\\nTHEY ARE NOT TRYING TO BE THOSE THINGS\\n\\nKOSS makes excellent SOUNDING headphones that rival the big wigs in the game. Yes... maybe the durability and/or design suffers a bit sometimes. Maybe their look or staying true to the 80s/90s look may not be for some... true indeed. However, with the price KOSS charges and the limited lifetime warranty they include... these headphones are a steal and as much of a steal as the KTXPRO1. The sound quality rivals headphones that costs 5 to 10 times as much. I suggest you get a pair and try them for yourself. Also put them up against Beats, Skullcandy, Harmon Kardon, Sony, etc whoever else you want when it comes to a PURE SOUND QUALITY COMPARISON and I'm telling you the price and sound quality compared to those other companies can't compare.

I've dropped mine, stuffed it into all sorts of cramped flight bags and generally treated it pretty roughly, and it still looks and works like new. The parts that matter are all metal and strong enough for demanding use. A few of the other brands I've tried might be lighter, but the plastic parts some of them use just never held up well for me.\\n\\nMy Surface tends to fit directly in the cradle (I don't use a case), and the iPad fits in the standard Apple leather case (but probably not a thicker case). Both fit well in either portrait or landscape mode and are solid enough to be secure in turbulence - I've yet to have an issue of either tablet popping out of the mount in rough air. I also like that the little clamps remain mostly out of the way - doesn't block the camera, microphone, ports, buttons, etc - although the iPad is somewhat challenging to press the various side buttons.\\n\\nOne of the great things about RAM is that you can buy the individual mounting pieces you need to create a custom mount, and you can use the same cradle in many different ways. In one of the planes I fly, there's a 1&#34; ball mounted on the panel and I'm able to connect a short articulating arm to this cradle for a perfect fit. Other aircraft I fly don't have this mounting ball, so I use a RAM suction cup to attach the cradle to the side of the windshield, or one of the RAM clamps to clamp the cradle to the yolk. Very convenient being able to carry a single cradle, yet having all these options.\\n\\nOne very small issue is that the back plate tends to be insulating and so my tablets tend to get fairly hot, especially if I leave the cradle in the aircraft on a hot day. A major improvement would be a way to have some sort of small heat sinks on the back of the cradle to help with this, but it's overall a pretty minor issue.\\n\\nThis is pretty much the perfect cradle for a larger tablet - definitely worth a look if you need to mount your tablet in any sort of boat, vehicle or airplane.","[]","B00O59G2WW","B09KP58DQN","AFFY6N7DPHAUMEB45B5JL2DOLZEQ","2017-03-03 18:46:45.000","5","True","509"

We had bought one camera and was transferring it from one car to the other depending on car we was traveling in. My husband does a lot of driving outside of town as to where I mostly travel locally and didn’t feel I needed one. However, after being involved in a accident last thanksgiving we decided we should have one in each vehicle. Besides moving it from car to car is rough on the cords. That said this accident we were involved in thanksgiving made the process with the insurance company a breaze as well as police responding to the scene. We were rear ended and the person whom hit us was rear ended as wel. This camera proved what was happening in front of us as well as behind. The car behind us was at full stop then pushed into us. This proved to police who was at fault and also having the video made dealing with insurance company a breeze. When we contacted them and told them we had video they were very pleased. This made it easy for them to review and a Birdseye view of the collision. The camera also recods sound so they could hear what was goin it on at the time of collision. Now we have one in both vehicles I feel like I have someone on my side in event we need it. When we purchased the camera we had hoped it would never had been needed but found out that it’s well worth the investment. We will be purchasing a 3 for my daughters car when she starts driving next year.\\nSet up was a little challenging for me the first time. I’m not very skilled at electronics so it took me a little while flipping through the book to get it setup the first time. With my husband out of town I set it up myself. If I can set it up anyone can. I also told my husband I needed to learn to operate the camera in event it fails. I can honestly say it wasn’t too difficult  The most complicated part was formatting the disk but once I found the right menu it was simple.\\nThe camera falls off the windo from time to time. I guess it vibrates loose but placing it again is easy. The camera seems to get confused sometimes if you make a lot of quick stops like fueling then jumping in and going to another location. Sometimes it powers off when I need it powered on. Easy fix is to unplug power and plug t back in.","[]","B0742J69SQ","B0742J69SQ","AFUKXXZ7SJFKFEJKLSBROTM6FBIQ","2017-10-31 18:52:13.765","2","True","509"
"652578","4","Great for general use; weak A/V","Great general use (web, steaming video, basic documents, etc.) chromebook with excellent battery life, even on wifi. This model sacrifices &#34;thin&#34; and some weight for durability. The rubber bumpers should help protect from moderate impacts, though I fear the screen hinge may be a potential issue with extended use. While nothing has broken, I notice the lid does not open smoothly and can cause twisting if you open from one corner. I do not foresee kids being &#34;careful&#34; in how they open the screen.\\n\\nMy main complaints are:\\n\\n1) Keyboard labels (minor issue): While the keyboard is mechanically sound and responsive, the key labels are printed in medium blue ink which make them very difficult to read in low light. Why Google did not use a lighter keyboard paint is beyond me. I think this was a design &#62; function issue. One could argue that &#34;kids&#34; shouldn't be working on their chromebooks in low light (ie. at night), but I frequently had to tilt the screen nearly closed as a light source to find certain keys.\\n\\n2) Video: For the price, I suppose you cannot expect full 1080 video, and 720 is fine if not a little blurry, especially when connected via HDMI to a TV. However, the color is somewhat washed out and the viewing angle is fairly narrow. You may find yourself adjusting the screen frequently if you change positions while using this chromebook.\\n\\n3) Audio: Again, for the price, you cannot expect high fidelity surround sound, but I did notice that during streaming tests, the source audio was degraded further than when the same video stream was played on a standard laptop. This was particularly noticeable when connected via HDMI to a TV set. Considering I have heard decent sound out of dirt-cheap mp3 players, I was annoyed by this\\n\\nSo, excellent little chromebook for general needs, but do not expect the Audio and Video to be very good for this price point.

I am sure the idea was for this to be in use by younger students and perhaps the IT support for a school district could buy parts as needed or combine the parts from 2 broken chromebooks to make one working one as time goes on.","[]","B01DBGVB7K","B01DBGVB7K","AHXF5257XQYHPEWIKNLLNI7TJHCA","2017-01-27 05:28:02.000","2","True","509"

It was working perfectly in that setup.\\n\\nLater, I decided to put it in the living room and connected it to our family's 65&#34; Sony 4K Bravia television. I played some 4K sample videos on YouTube and some free ones I downloaded from another site. Display quality is great and, yes, it's 4K!\\n\\nSince this is running Windows 10 and my primary computer on Windows 8.1, I enabled media and file sharing between the two. I can watch videos saved on my primary computer in my room streamed via WIFI to this box in the living room on the 65&#34; Sony TV.\\n\\nHEAT\\nIt does get very hot when you're watching a video. But that is normal since this box has no fan and the case serves as its heatsink.\\n\\nWhen I'm running RealFlow on my primary computer, and this box is only serving its floating license via WIFI, it's cold as a floor tile. In case you're wondering what RealFlow is, it's a program for running fluid simulation that you can render in other 3D apps like Maya, Modo or Cinema 4D.\\n\\nISSUE\\nAfter about two weeks since I put it in the living room, it stopped booting into Windows. Instead, it went straight into a prompt where I had to type &#34;exit.&#34;\\n\\nThis is a known issue and has an easy fix. All you need to do is update the BIOS with the latest version. You can download the BIOS update  from the MINIX website with full instruction on how to install it (Sorry. I'm not allowed to post the link here per Amazon's Community Guidelines).\\n\\nRATING\\nI am giving this a five star since I am happy with my purchase.

IT SOUNDS GOOD!!!\\nThese are great little speakers for my Computer.  I have nice speakers on a nice stereo, but wanted something for desktop audio for browsing facebook, watching youtube, playing games.  These look they will do the job just fine.\\n\\nPros:\\n-they are completely quite when they're not being used. There is no hum, buzz, static, high pitched whine, or other noises coming from these when no audio is playing.\\n-The are easy to install.\\n-They sound good\\n-Each piece is relatively small, taking up little of my desktop real estate; the subwoofer is also small, fitting easily on the floor.\\n-There is a separate volume control on the sub-woofer for bass.\\n-On the Right speaker there is an easy to use physical rotating knob for the main volume. There is a clear &#34;CLICK&#34; when turned fully counter-clockwise and turned off. there are no controls on the left speaker.\\n-When turned ON there is a easy to see, but non-intrusive yellow LED on the right speaker, directly above the volume/ power control.\\n-Everything is included that you need to use these speakers.\\n-Straight-forward, Old-School operation: no WiFi nor Bluetooth connectivity.  Only 3.5mm audio plug OR RCA (white and red) inputs.\\n-This will work as easily as speakers for a smart phone or tablet as for a desktop or laptop computer.\\n\\nCons:\\n-I have a standing desk, with my desktop computer to the LEFT of my monitors.  The included cables were not long enough for this configuration.  Since the Audio input is affixed to the RIGHT speaker, and it is only approx 5.5' long, it will not reach to the far left of my desk.  I had to use a 6' extension cable for the 3.5mm audio cable.  Note, that even for a 'normal' sitting desk, the audio cable will likely be too short for many people.  Please consider purchasing an extension cable when you buy these speakers.","[]","B002FU5QM0","B07P1FN7KQ","AHIBXITBQLJERJAGHS5LCVVGW4DA","2017-10-16 00:40:10.346","160","True","509"

Seriously, whoever came up with this bird brained idea of inserting 4 tension rods into each light housing while attempting to get them all to keep the other end in a shallow, tiny, sliver of a pocket inside the softbox needs to be FIRED. Wrestle one rod in, attempt to hold it so it doesn't pop out of softbox while simultaneously wrangling the second rod in. 10 frustrating minutes later.... success!! Carefully get the third rod in, grab the 4th rod, and ohhhh.... that's a shame. Two of the three rods you had already gotten into place have slipped out of their pockets. Welp, let's start again, shall we?\\n\\nFinally got that situation under control? GREAT!! Now you need to unbox two smaller boxes, pry open a hard plastic shell, and unwrap each lightbulb.  You don't want a mess everywhere so put foam wrapping back in plastic container, place plastic container in small box, place both small boxes in larger box and set aside neatly. There are 4 sets of them by the way! Have fun!! If you manage to get each one of the lights put together in less than 20 minutes you deserve a prize. Or a break.\\n\\nOk, done with your photoshoot?? GREAT! Now let's do this allllll in reverse, K?? Unbox and pull out two boxes from larger box, open plastic container, take out foam wrap. Unscrew one light bulb. Wrap in foam wrap. Place wrapped lightbulb in plastic container, place plastic container in small box, place small box in large box. Good job!! Now do that 7 more times and then you can start removing tension rods! Wheeeeee!!\\n\\nIf you are like me and do not have a professional studio or even a room that you can dedicate solely to leaving these lights up, BEWARE. You will spend FOREVER setting up and then tearing down for your photoshoot. On the bright side, once I invested in several more lights (I bought a used set of a different brand from someone) I can finally take indoor photos that aren't dark and grainy. The only problem is, I have to set up 6 different studio lights to do it. And then of course, tear them all down afterwards.

"260659","1","POORLY MADE, FRAGILE, OVERENGINEERED PRODUCT, AVOID!!!!!","It's a poorly made product. AVOID.\\n\\nIf I can describe this product in a few words, it would be a &#34;poorly made, overengineered product&#34;, in other words a recipe for disaster. It sure looks sexy enough, and the idea of buying a collapsible softbox was appealing enough to me. Oh, yes and at $58, when similar products like the one from Fotodiox, or the Glow Parapop, cost two to four times as much, what's not to like? (I have no experience with either of them, but it looks like those have metal rods.)\\nWell, after using it three of four times, if slipped from my assistant's hands (it happens on a gig), fell to the ground, one of its fiberglass (?) rods broke and that's all she wrote. I emailed the Gradus Group, the company that sells &#34;Impact&#34; and their customer support person told me that unfortunately &#34;impact&#34; is not covered under warranty!!! Which is kind of ironic for a product called &#34;Impact!&#34; I mean, exactly what is the warranty on this thing, if they will not stand behind it, when it is disabled after a minor fall?  So, basically the two issues with it are a) The fiberglass rods are too fragile and they will break on slight impact b) They are hard to find and not user replaceable. In other words, even if you manage to find rods, they are connected together with some proprietary type of join/screw, not regular flathead screw, Phillips or hex, so unless you have some specific tool, you can't replace the rod yourself.  Long story short, the customer service person offered to fix it for $25 plus shipping both ways, which would mean it would cost me pretty much what I paid for it. It's that old German proverb &#34;you buy cheap, you'll by twice.&#34; So, I suggest you a) either avoid it completely b) Make sure you get some accident warranty with it. c) Buy one from another manufacturer with metal rods. Amazon gave me a $5 promotional consolation discount. Then after hanging up, I got a survey window, I said I was unhappy, and they gave me a full refund. So luckily Amazon stood behind it.","[]","B014EGV2XO","B014EGV2XO","AHC7NWO3NMIWKNQMQMOSZ2Q7ME6A","2017-03-15 19:55:17.000","13","True","509"
"52989","1","Bad design","The case is badly designed. Here are the issues:\\n\\n1) When you fold the front flap over so you can hold it like a tablet and not like an open book, it sticks out awkwardly in the back. This makes it hard and unstable to hold, not to mention the unpleasant feeling of the sharp edges on your fingers - to be picky :)\\n\\n2) The case is supposed to fold into a triangle that would hold the tablet at an upright angle. That simply doesn't happen. The triangle tends to unfold, the weight of the tablet pushes it down further, and the whole thing collapses. I think other reviewers have complained about this, too.\\n\\n3) If you want to stick your tablet to, say, the fridge (so you can be looking at a recipe while cooking), then again the design doesn't work well. At the vertical position it is impossible, as it starts opening and rotating. At the horizontal position it is workable, except that it tends to flop.\\n\\nIt would be nice to have a tablet that had a small magnet in the back, so the front cover would stick to the back when folded over. This would take care of #3 and perhaps #1. It would also be nice to have a two-piece case, meaning one where the hard back case is a separate piece from the soft-flap front case; the two snap together on the side and the front flap pivots around that axis. This would take care of #1, as it would do away with the extra case material that covers the side of the tablet - a thin strip, but nonetheless annoying as it effectively makes the front flap longer when folded over.\\n\\nI have seen cases designed as two pieces and with two magnets for the iPad, and they are simple, cheap, yet functional. Unfortunately, I have done an exhaustive search for the Tab S2 8.0 and all tablets come in one piece. In fact, the vast majority seem to be identical (same manufacturer, different retail brands or something). It makes you think they didn't even try the product before mass producing it!\\n\\nI will be returning this tablet and buying one that is in one piece (as they all are - no choice there) but will at least have a magnet in the back (that's how they advertise it at any rate; I haven't received it yet).","[]","B01706WRG6","B01706WRG6","AGJPXBJIWUI2PGQ4KFPPBKOXEA3Q","2017-01-16 02:55:17.000","0","True","509"

I wore out two pair and was very pleased with them.\\n\\nWhen it recently came time to get a new set instead of just reordering from BOSE I spent about a half hour flipping through Amazon and Google looking for reviews. I found a review that raved about the Sony MDR-1000X (the /B just refers to the color) and decided to give it a try. More than that I saved significant money by getting a refurbished pair.\\n\\nI would like to give this model my complete and total endorsement. It very much outperforms the previous BOSE models I owned though I am mindful of comparing a new Sony model to what were older BOSE models and they may have improved in the past few years.\\n\\nI use mine in a Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber where there is considerable noise from the air being pumped into the chamber near my head. These reduced that noise to almost (but not quite) nothing. They are also Bluetooth and, while at first I thought that to be a rather extravagant feature I have found it to be delightful (though the noise cancelling is really what I am looking for). I use my cell phone to clock my time and play music from there into the headphones.\\n\\nOne time I happened to be listening to music when I got out of the chamber and went to the bathroom with the headphones on. When I flushed the toilet I was stunned when I could not hear the toilet flush. I would expect some background noise but there as none. I probably looked a bit silly but I flushed it again just to be sure.\\n\\nI am in no way meaning to slam new BOSE models or say anything negative about them as the older models have served me well and the latest technology may be very good; I just have no experience with it. They did not have a Bluetooth offering the last time I bought from them.\\n\\nSony has done a great job here!\\n\\nThe only negative is that they did not include a User's Guide. But that probably bothers me because I'm 70 years old and used to another era. Maybe they include one with new ones but I did get one refurbished.

"151675","4","Belkin Folio - Pricey, Purple and Practical - Custom Design Demands a Premium Price","This product is simple, but effective. It is not intended to protect your Voyage reader from drops or serious mishaps. It's sole function is to provide protection against scratches or minor bumps for those times when it is in your pocket or purse or just lying on a table or shelf. It's well designed from the perspective that it gives a reasonable degree of protection without interfering with the operation of the device or it's recharging. It has a stiff cover to protect the fragile screen from bumps and scratches, The magnetic fasteners hold this cover firmly in place. There are no hooks or latches required to hold it closed. The bottom side of the Voyage is sitting in a form fitting shell . The Voyage itself is held firmly in place on the base by a non-intrusive lip. The folio base bends slightly allowing the Voyage to sit wedged firmly against it. The cover is fastened with a fabric like strip which allows it to fold flat against the back of the reader.  The on/off button is accessable but slightly recessed due to the thickness of the case. This makes it slightly harder to press, but much easier to find. It adds very little weight  or size to the Voyage and as has been previously noted it is a nice shade of purple. I have seen numerous complaints about it being difficult to remove though I really don't see why anyone would need to unless they wanted to replace it with something else. I haven't tried, but I suspect it would not be too difficult to remove if you held the Voyage face down above a pillow or other soft surface and gently flexed the back piece, It probably would be hard to lift straight up and out as it is a very snug fit.\\nIs it worth $29 ??  At first glance you would probably say &#34;NO WAY !&#34;. However it is not just the materials you are paying for ...It is a completely custom design suited only for the Voyage. It is light weight, does not interfer with the operation of the unit, gives adequate protection for most users, does not significantly increase the size of the unit and it is definitely purple. I gave it 4 stars because it is a bit pricey, but it is only useable on one brand and style of reader,  I don't know if I would recommend it for a young child, however I would probably buy a young child a slightly less expensive reader to get him or her started.","[]","B00IU7CCWO","B00IU7CB02","AEK2FWZLHHWTSL2N3OH56QRRBQVA","2017-07-17 15:21:35.044","2","True","508"

I am a picky technologist and photographer, so did a lot of research to find something with good color, contrast, black levels, etc.. My prior monitor was a 30-inch Dell. The color, resolution and clarity on this Sony is amazing. Looking at some pictures I've taken for the first time on a monitor this good and this big brought tears to my eyes. Before settling on this model, I tried the 49X800E, which has more color depth (more bits). I decided that 49&#34; is just too big. I had a sore neck after one day! 43&#34; is the perfect size. I also realized I didn't need the extra colors of the 800 series because my graphics card can't produce the required HDR signal. I saved some money and got the 720E. To connect to your TV, you must use either the HDMI 2 or HDMI 3 inputs, and set the input to be &#34;Advanced&#34; in the settings. Then use the &#34;Graphics&#34; picture style. My only complaint is that the monitor has only three power saving levels. It is useful for lowering the brightness which could otherwise be overwhelming, but the Medium Power saving is a tad too bright and the &#34;High&#34; (lowest power) is too dim. The only other complaint is that the black levels aren't perfect. This is a side-illuminated panel and in a dark room with a black image on screen, you can see dark dark gray where it should be black. But this isn't really an issue during normal use. There is the 900E which has dynamic back-lighting, but the minimum size there is 49&#34;, and the TV is twice the price of this one.\\n\\nMy Dell 9650 with its own 4K screen drives this TV perfectly. My desktop, with an Nvidia GTX1050, has trouble with with text. Research shows Nvidia has a history of text problems and there is supposed to be a way to reinstall the Nvidia drivers after tweaking the .inf file. If I had it to do over again, I'd try a graphics card from a different manufacturer that supports 3840x2160 resolution at 60Hz.","[]","B071FFFRXM","B071FFFRXM","AE5H5LCVQPVELNQMIPHYDVGQAKGA","2017-12-15 08:30:35.839","7","False","508"

Bought at target.","Now i must clarify i didn't buy it from amazon so this has nothing to do with amazon its all about the TV.\\n\\nSo a couple days ago i went down to target and got this tv and at first look its an amazing tv with a fantastic picture. The transition between apps nd such is super fast but the apps menus themselves run a tiny bit slow. Once you get out of the menus and into the functions of the apps (at least youtube and amazon prime) they run just fine.\\n\\nThe first real problem i encountered is that the back of the TV isn't 100% flat so i had to take a hack saw to my wall mounting bracket to make it fit on the TV. This was a pain in the ass but after i got it done it fit just fine on the TV HOWEVER then another part of the bracket covered the rear panel of IO on the TV. I didnt take a hack saw to that because 2 of the HDMI ports were clear and thats what i needed for the time.\\n\\nThe second problem i encountered is one of the HDMI ports on the TV seems to be defective. I plugged it into my computer and the TV detected something in the HDMI port and my computer detected the TV however nothing would display so i plugged everything into the second HDMI port and it worked fine.\\n\\nI was ready to over look ALL of this annoyance until i went to start using the TV and SURPRISE!

"148984","5","Sleek, compact, easy to build in.","I have had another NZXT case before, the H440, and I liked this every bit as much as that one, although I have to say I much prefer the toned down cleaner look of this, along with the gorgeous  tempered glass side panel. Everything I buy from NZXT is just pure quality, and I can't recommend this case enough. It's short on storage options, compared to the H440, so if you need a heaping ton of storage (more than what 3 SSDs, and 2 HDDs can provide) then I would look elsewhere, but for a gaming build, where I've placed a 240GB  SSD, and a 4TB HDD, it gets along just fine. It accommodates the NZXT kraken x52 perfectly, and would even fit their 280mm x62 if you wanted to, or any other similar option on the market, although you must mount it as an intake, that hasn't seemed to have a negative impact on performance whatsoever.\\n\\nIt's capable of fitting rather long graphics cards, as it has a good 1 3/4&#34; to spare with my Sapphire R9 390 that measures just over 12&#34;, and that's with the radiator/fans in the front. If you were using an air cooler, you could expect about another inch of room if you were to just put a couple intake fans in the front.  Be wary when buying an air cooler for this case, as many of the large dual tower heatsinks will be either be touching the glass when you put it back on, or will be so tall that you just won't be able to put the window back on. for that reason, I recommend something along the lines of a Cryorig H7.\\n\\nA very specific problem I ran into with this case, is if you are using an ASUS ROG Z270 motherboard, the rear fan will cover some of the lighting zone on the I/O shroud. Particularly the Maximus IX branding bit, so if that bothers you, again, I would recommend a different case, but personally, I don't mind, as the light bar beneath that branding is still visible.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if you are looking for a simplistic, but well built case with a glass panel, and ease of cable management is appealing to you, this would have to be the case I would recommend above all else for the astounding quality for the price.","[]","B01LZQMXJT","B07J45XS7K","AFXCPVM5TERFIJQZZ3OY2WVENSBQ","2017-06-13 18:07:44.960","1","True","508"

If it had rained, which these days it might have, it could have gotten soaked and damaged without the packaging.)\\nThe player was packed in a heavy bubble package too. Good protection.\\nThe unit is solid/sturdy- not flimsy. Even a kid has a chance at NOTdestroying it.\\nThe buttons on the unit are raised and tactile. Plus you can read them. Even the remote buttons are readable. The On/Off switch on the side is not readable. I needed a flashlight to see it.\\nI bought the unit primarily for audio books (CDs). I know I could have bought a CD player but the ability to watch a movie too made more sense for me. I wasn't planning on taking it for a walk. I wanted it primarily in the house or to take on the road. And I liked the portability.\\nI turned on the &#34;last memory&#34; feature (in setup). It allows you to pick up where you left off. When listening to audio books, I turned off the unit, with the CD still inside the unit. When I turned it back on, the memory still picked up where I left off.\\nThe volume was good indoors. But I have it at the highest setting. I would guess you'd need a headphone/earbuds in the car or in a place with some noise.\\nThe unit comes with a remote, power cord, game controller and a car adapter.\\nThe manual, like most, are skimpy. If you are not familiar with features such as PROG, COPY, OSD, REPEAT, there is no explanation on how to use it. I recommend reading the FAQ. It tells you more by reading the opposite of what works. (That may be confusing, but it tells you what to do if something doesn't work. But, it's telling you how to get it to work.)\\nThe battery life is approximately 2-3 hours. A feature I would like to have is a &#34;battery life&#34; indicator. I was listening to a CD and it suddenly stopped. It ran out of battery power. Fortunately, I was able to plug it in.\\nOverall, I am happy with the unit.","[]","B06Y2XDB5F","B06Y2XDB5F","AG4RXTFQRO5ZYLELMH2EM5Q3BAAQ","2017-08-11 06:39:33.648","14","True","508"
"6246","4","LIke all asus laptop/tablets, they could do a little better if they had paid attention to more details.","It is important to note that there are differ versions of the UX360CA.  Mine is a M3-6y30, 8gb ram, 256gb ssd.  This configuration allows the unit to run up to 12 hrs.  So don't let the model number fool you into thinking that they all have the same performance in terms of processing speed and battery life.  M3-7y30 is a bit faster and has similar battery life.  Those will other processors will take a hit in battery life for a faster processor.  So keep in mind, it depends on how much processing power your need vs the battery life.  For me, this unit met expectations except for one thing.  The bezes are at least half an inch.  This makes the laptop heavier and larger than necessary.  I really wanted a 12.5&#34; t300 chi, but the battery life was about 6 hrs, the processor was slower, the ram was limited to 4gb, and it only came in windows 8.1.  The ideal unit for me would be the t300 chi, with the m3-6y30, a bluetooth keyboard with a dock in the hinge(like the latest t100ha) and 8gb ram .  I have notice that this laptop and t100 chi has Bluetooth issues causing blue screens, lockups, and freezing.  I had to update this unit to the lastest bios 300 and it solved the Bluetooth problems.  The t100 required me to disable the computer from prioritizing Bluetooth functions in the Bluetooth radio advance settings.  It took about 3yrs to figure out the bug.  Later versions of the t100HA resolved problems with the Bluetooth by having a hard connection from the tablet to keyboard.  So this is a good machine, but be aware you should upgrade the bios immediately to avoid any Bluetooth problems.  There is some flex in the keyboard when used on the lap.  The mousepad is HUGH....occasionally can be touched by the palm as you are typing on your lap.  Lastly, the sd card slot should be a microsd slot.  The sd card sticks way out and can get sheered off.  I wish I had option to leave in a sd, or microsd slot that allowed me to store the card in there securely.  This could be used to back up files quickly or for external transfers.  A concealed eject button would be nice for a concealed microsd.","[]","B01HZT6AR0","B0756YGZBT","AGVAKWVKEL45UKNWJPA6I2E5VSYA","2017-11-02 04:39:33.424","3","True","508"

As a homeschool educator I understand the importance of doing something the proper way the first time, so as not to have to unlearn it later.  Learning is hard, but unlearning is harder.  This is the only wireless child sized mouse I could find and it came shipped straight from China.  Thank you China; my 8 year old loves it!  Now she can even use the scroll wheel.\\n\\n***update****\\nThis mouse does suffer from a couple of issues.\\n\\nOne, it will not always wake up after going to sleep.  Usually clicking one of the buttons will do it, but on a rare occasion it is necessary to remove and replug the USB receiver.  However, I can not say with certainty that it is the fault of the mouse and not the operating system, or even something else.  I can only say that I do not have this same problem with my other wireless mice.\\n\\nTwo, I've noticed that keeping a cell phone too close to the mouse will significantly interfere with the receiver.  Also, placing the receiver too close to a large speaker or placing any significant electromagnetic field in the line of sight between the mouse and receiver, such as a running area heater, will interfere with the signal.  It is fair to say that some of these issues are universal to nearly all wireless devices.  However, this device does seem particularly susceptible.\\n\\nThree, for reasons I can not reliably identify, when using an internet browser, the mouse appears to occasionally send a back-button command, which can be incredibly annoying and result in losing data that was entered into a web page.  I have had this same problem with my Logitech wireless mouse but was able to shut off the &#34;feature&#34; using logitech's control panel.  This mouse shouldn't even have the capability to send the signal and thus has no control panel to shut it off.  Specifically, some mice have a button 3 and 4 which are used as backpage and forward in a browser.  There is a free mouse utility called X-Mouse that provides a control panel for disabling individual  mouse buttons.  I have shut off buttons 3 and 4 and the problem hasn't happened since.\\n\\nI hope this helps.","[]","B01EZZM5MG","B08G4PKC3Y","AGIKL6MPL7XVQDJZQMQR4E7HYSEQ","2017-02-27 18:34:32.000","30","True","508"

Five nights a week, for 3-4 hours I watch a news channel. When I'm not watching, the TV is off or a screen saver kicks in. I also watch other programs all the time.\\n\\nAfter a year, the LOGO from that channel appeared BURNED IN. I talked to tech support and they said there is an automatic refresh that clears the screen so that doesn't happen. OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT TRUE... SINCE IT DID. Since the TV only has a 1 year warranty, I called my SMART GUARD PROTECTION warranty to take care of things. The following happened.\\n\\n1. The nearest technician is four hours away. So Smart Guard didn't send a tech, they asked for a picture of the burn in. I sent it. Then the repair company said it wasn't covered.\\n2. I asked SMART GUARD why it wasn't covered. They said it wasn't covered by the ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER. Apparently the ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER doesn't cover screen burn in.\\n3. I called LG (the original manufacturer) and explained what was happening with the TV. THE LG TECHNICIAN SAID THIS: &#34;Screen burn is not something covered by the LG warranty. Even if it happens during the warranty period, we will not cover it. Every TV is checked before it's sent out to make sure it's working properly.&#34; I explained it was obviously NOT working properly because I had SCREEN BURN. He said,&#34;It doesn't matter.

BUT","I'll probably change this review if i manage to get everything working, because the product itself is pretty decent.\\n\\nBUT.... one of the reasons i chose this was every review i read indicated how great this model was because it included the mounting bracket and screws to install the addon HDD. Over and over, i read or heard &#34;It's great how the mounting hardware is included, and you don't have to call support and order it&#34; - All a lie. We opened the hard drive bay - no hard ware.\\n\\nSo, I call tech support to order the mounting hardware. The gentleman I spoke to was polite, but acted like I was trying to order a Flux Capacitor from Planet Xenos. He had never heard of this &#34;mounting bracket for an addon hard drive&#34;, he spent forever asking supervisors and co-workers and searching in the system. Eventually, after quite a lengthy delay, he comes back on and says &#34;I think I've found what you need!&#34; - and gets my shipping info.\\n\\nA week later, it arrives, i unpack it - no screws. The screws to attach the bracket to the hard drive actually were in the original laptop box, but the screws for attaching the bracketed hard drive to the case -not there. I guess I had to ask for the screws separately. So here I am, about to make another call, and I'm sure again I'll be talked to like I'm ordering made up parts from make believe land, and try to get the screws I need.\\n\\nAcer - if you're going to include all the mounting hardware in the models you send to reviewers, do the same thing for the ones you ship to customers. Once I get the screws and can install hard drive I ordered as a bundle from Amazon (HINT - if you ordered the bundle or are going to order the extra HDD bundle, might as well call Acer and get the process rolling to order your bracket  - AND also don't forget to order the screws for the bracket, since apparantly you have to specify that as well), I might very well change my review score. As I said, the laptop itself is nice, I'm just very displeased that something that touts itself as &#34;easy to upgrade&#34; has turned into such a process.","[]","B06Y4GZS9C","B07KML89F3","AEZBKQGEPTOYNIIICAULW7OSHQIA","2017-08-23 17:18:55.171","4","True","508"

I love that you can program the different single-use buttons to do all the tasks needed to get you ready to watch TV, the DVD or whatever you want.  It works with all our devices (an LG TV, Panasonic VCR and Blu-Ray, Roku, and Verizon cable box).\\n\\nBe warned, setup is not trivial. You absolutely must have a computer or the device is worthless. If you don't have a computer, don't buy this. If you don't have a computer in the same room as the TV, be prepared to do a lot of running back and forth between the computer and the TV while you're getting everything set up. To be sure, it's a LOT easier than fiddling through pages of codes and hoping you can figure out which one your machine uses, but it's not for people who are not comfortable with technology. If the one I bought for the relative ever loses battery power, I don't expect them to be able to get it reprogrammed on their own.\\n\\nTo do the setup, you connect it to your computer, download the required software, and create a logon to Logitech's website. Then for each function (e.g. Watch TV, Watch Movie, Listen to Movie) you program in the devices it's supposed to work with, and tweak a few options. Save, give it a minute or so to update the remote, and you're good to go.\\n\\nThe Roku option is interesting in that you can program in shortcuts to specific channels, so that when you press one of the four function buttons (2 on each side of the screen), you can go directly to Netflix, Amazon or whatever.\\n\\nThere are three dedicated buttons (Watch TV, Watch Movie, Listen to Music), but you can access those functions via the little LED screen as well as others (e.g. we have &#34;Watch VHS&#34; because we're dinosaurs and still have a VCR). Listen To Music is an odd choice for a button label - you'd thing they'd label it something different like &#34;Watch Streaming&#34;, &#34;Your Option&#34; or even &#34;Undefined&#34;.

"878552","2","Not compatible with some MacBook Pro's","My simple idea was to buy a 4k TV and use it with my MacBook Pro Retina 13&quot; Early 2015.  Apple says in their online support on the this subject that my laptop will supply 3840x2160@60HZ (2160p60) but only on the mdp port.  Online talk was that it wouldn't work with an mdp to hdmi passive adapter, but that this pluggable adapter would work and the Plugable specs on this Amazon page says it will convert the mdp signal to HDMI 2160p60.  Because I believed the specs, I wasted many hours trying to get this configuration to work on two different 4K tv's, using Apple's latest Os X (10.12.6).  After installing SwitchResX (a truly useful program) and proving that my MBP would only supply 3840x2160@30 Hz and not at 60Hz with this configuration, I bought Yet Another Monitor and getting the same result, I finally started blaming the Plugable adapter.  Scouring their website, in their FAQ, I found this:\\n\\nQ: Why am I unable to set a 3840×2160 resolution at a 60Hz refresh rate from my MacBook Pro/Mac Pro (Retina, Late 2013 and later)?\\nMac OS X/macOS has limited the 4K video output from their mDP ports to a maximum of 3840×2160 (4K) at 30Hz when using our adapter with an HDMI 2.0 rated cable and HDMI 2.0 compatible display. Some customers have been successful in achieving a 4K resolution at 60Hz refresh rate when using 3rd party applications, like SwitchResX, but we are unable to guarantee success.\\n\\nSo I really was wasting my time and Plugable knew all along that it wouldn't work with my MacBook Pro because Apple detects the Plugable adapter and limits refresh rate to 30Hz.\\n\\nTo prove to myself that the Plugable adapter is the problem, I bought a Samsung U28e590d monitor (thanks Amazon) which has a Display Port input and an mdp to DP cable and voilla !!  2160p60 appeared instantly.\\n\\nSo if you have the wrong MacBook Pro, don't buy this adapter.

"7913","5","Best Lightning cable available today","The PowerLine II Dura line of cables from Anker are their best yet. I own their original PowerLine cables and their braided nylon PowerLine+ cables, and those have performed flawlessly. No frays, no breaks. The new Dura cable feels even stronger. I did something with this cable that I’ve never done with other cables I’ve owned: I intentionally pulled and twisted at the ends to see how it held up. The premium build quality became evident during that test; there was no damage and the cable looks and functions exactly as it did when it came out of the box. Although I’ve only owned this Dura cable for a week, I’m certain that it will hold up over the long run.\\n\\nAnker further improved the other outstanding feature of their line of cables: the warranty for Dura cables is a lifetime warranty instead of an 18-month warranty. This makes the Dura cables a no-brainer. They seem very unlikely to ever break, but having the assurance that Anker will stand behind their product indefinitely is a tremendous asset. Anker’s customer service team is the best I’ve dealt with in the consumer technology industry, and unlike the competing low-cost accessory companies selling on Amazon, I fully expect Anker to be around for the long haul.\\n\\nThis is my first one-foot cable; it’s a great length for charging my iPhone or AirPods in my home office. It makes three-foot and six-foot cables feel too long, although those certainly have their place in the car, bedroom, and living room. If you don’t yet own a one-foot cable (maybe you’re like me and you’ve always wanted the highest foot-to-dollar bang for your buck), it would be a great addition to your charging collection.\\n\\nI rate this cable five stars, although I would award a sixth star for the inclusion of the lifetime warranty if that were possible. The cable was designed and built to last a lifetime, and Anker seems determined to ensure that one way or another, it will.\\n\\nI couldn’t guess as to what the next innovation in cable technology will be, but I’m sure that Anker will be pioneering it, and I’m looking forward to finding out what else is up their sleeve.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ip3EzrS2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ip3EzrS2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ip3EzrS2L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01N522SM2","B0B933F7G2","AF745AB6B7OGY5U6LOSP4ATAVNDA","2017-03-29 14:38:00.000","6","False","508"
"967789","4","Having connectivity issues with 2.4Ghz band? Try tweaking 'Professional' wireless settings","Update on 3/16/2017: Revise ratings to 4* because my 2.4Ghz band connectivity issue was resolved by tweaking the 'Professional' wireless settings of the 2.4Ghz band. Specifically, I disabled TX bursting, WMM APSD, airtime fairness, explicit beamforming. Asus support was relatively responsive and courteous but did not provide any useful tips beyond the very basics (updating router firmware, doing factory reset, updating client wifi card driver, etc). The router now performs very well. I deduct one star for the lack of 'Professional' tech support.\\n\\nUpdate on 3/11/2017: Still in the process of communicating with Asus support to trouble shoot the connectivity issue. I performed a reset to factory setting following recommendation; that didn't do anything. I then started browsing wireless networking forums online and came across discussions on the advanced settings on the 'Professional' tab. It appears that most of the settings on that tab were default to be enabled, while the wifi card in my laptop is too old to take advantage of them. So i started disabling the settings one by one, starting with beamforming (a function that my wifi card just doesn't support). By this point I've disabled about four of them that were previously enabled, and I *feel* the time between connection drops has gotten longer. Fingers crossed...\\n\\nOriginal Review: Have had the router for about 6 days. It started out great, easy setup, very fast speed (on par with wired connection). Then 2 days into it, connection to the 2.4Ghz band (via a laptop) keeps dropping while connection to the 5 Ghz band (via an iPad) seems solid. I've tried rebooting the router, changing channel from the default 1 to 6, to 11. Nothing helps. The dropped connection tends to be brief, like 10-20 seconds, sometimes too brief to be even noticed up by Windows network connection. I usually detect them when I suddenly couldn't load a web page immediately. When this happens to 2.4Ghz band, connection to the 5 Ghz band remains intact and sees no pause. The dropped connection can be fixed by disconnecting and re-connecting to the router again in Windows if I don't want to wait for it to return naturally, but for a ~$150 router, that performance is not acceptable. The same laptop had no connection problem with my previous $24 router.","[]","B00FB45SI4","B09P4KJSTQ","AFHJI7HTJPJWO6X3UHYJLF4HK26Q","2017-03-07 06:25:13.000","0","False","508"

I have an OTA antenna in my house that finds  19 channels so I figured I should get somewhere in this neighborhood with the &#34;Newest technology&#34;.  Didn't happen so I called tech support.  Like everyone else with negative reviews I got to spend a long time listening to really bad music.  Tech support finally agreed to take the unit back for testing. 3 weeks later I had it back with a report that they could not find any issues.  Put it back on the RV and got the same results as before.  I called tech support again and after a long wait I was told by tech support that the issue was that I was to close to the transmission towers.  I'm 26 miles line of sight from the farthest tower and 1/4 mile from the closest one.  The close one came in fine but the far ones didn't, so the diagnosis seemed a bit confusing.  They told me to get LNB's (noise limiters to dull the signal).  I did and guess what, the motor won't work if you install LNB's in the coax cable.\\nDue to medical issues, last year we weren't able to do much camping so the only time the RV was used was at a park with cable.  I didn't use the antenna so didn't know if the previous years issues were still present.\\nNow I'm having everyone's favorite, the wonderful E-3 motor error.  Time for another jam session with hold music (I'm losing my will to live!!!!) and finally got tech support again.  Unit is out of warranty so now they say I have to pay shipping both ways, $70 just to look at it and parts and labor to fix anything they find wrong.  Oh yeah, they'll give me a $70 credit if they do put in new parts.\\nDid a quick search online and I can get a new crank-up antenna for around $90.  I'm not a math wizard but I did a quick calculation and figured I'd cut my losses and go with an old fashioned antenna.\\nHopefully someone with a lot more money then me will start a class action suit and maybe someday I'll get some of my money back.

Having a retractable cord headset would help to simplify this mess.  (Oh, why use wired headset?  I've tried using a BT set with a transmitter, but the signal breaks up more than a wired set does.  And the wired headset is handy on flights AND works on Hop On-Hop Off tours. )\\n\\nTo extend the cord, pull both ends at the same time, with the retracting mechanism in the middle.  No problem. To get the cable to retract, it requires a pull of both ends and the cable is supposed to retract.  It doesn't, at least not quickly.  The unit I have requires at least 20-30 attempts before it will release and retract.  That is not going to work for me.  And with each attempt, I get the impression that it will not retract at all.  I usually give up, then return to it later to try again.  So far, it eventually will retract.  But what's the point?  20-30 attempts is far from convenient.\\n\\nSound quality?  The description mentions full bass sound.  I find it to be very thin and tinny.  I have not enjoyed using this for music.  At least if it fails to retract, it is still usable but I'm disappointed it doesn't work as expected.\\n\\nTwo thumbs down.  I would have paid much more for a headset with a quality retracting mechanism and better sound quality.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717kruLpFJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717kruLpFJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717kruLpFJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MBEVp71PL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MBEVp71PL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MBEVp71PL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P6y-iSPJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P6y-iSPJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P6y-iSPJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VPt5EpgML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VPt5EpgML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VPt5EpgML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YQzKXg2eL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YQzKXg2eL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YQzKXg2eL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B005AWY7WU","B005AWY7WU","AGF3SEPGKG2TBKX7LXQ4BOWB3PDQ","2017-11-28 13:16:09.322","2","True","508"
"237516","3","$2500 was apparently not enough to buy a working a laptop","*****Updated Review******\\nAmazon stepped up and worked with me.  They reconsidered my issue and was able to work with me to develop a more fair solution.  Josh and Angel from support were genuine in their desire to work something out as they could see my point.  I want to thank everyone at Amazon who allowed this transaction to occur.  I immediately went a purchased a new system within 10 minutes of new this new arrangement.  Point here, is sometimes, it takes a couple of calls, but know that customer support (at least josh and angel) really wants to help.  So be kind to them and just explain why you feel strongly.  But be NICE! :)  Only moving it from a 1 to a 4 star because the description of warranty was a little confusing and it took 2 hrs worth of phone time.  This does not say the product is the right choice for you, but hopefully will remind you to research the &#34;fine print&#34;.  Thank you Amazon.\\n\\nOriginal Review:\\nI purchased this laptop less than 7 months ago.  I am a software engineer, so I am not technically challenged.\\nI have had issues, but due to schedule of work, I am not able to baby a broken purchase.  The laptop is awesome to look at, but Amazon only is willing to provide support for 1 month after purchase, vendor wants to charge another $200 to fix the issues.\\n\\nI bought this for the flexibility of being able to take the Oculus with me on my travels, but it breaks often.  Dell vendor indicated this is not a laptop issue, but something OCULUS probably caused.  Many services and drivers have been destroyed and do not work any longer.  I would NOT buy this unless you have unlimited cash to get it working properly whenever it goes down.  It sucks because I have used this laptop LITERALLY for gaming only and MAYBE have had time to log in 30 times since May 2017.\\n\\nTech support (Adam) was super nice and Amazon support (Angel) was very professional.  Phone disconnected and she called me right back. True professionalism.  Product SUCKS if you have to keep spending money to fix something that should be broken.  If OCULUS is the reason you buy this laptop....I am not sure its a good deal.  Good luck in your choice.","[]","B01N0THP9L","B01N0THP9L","AENEOI75AM7KLJTLPKELLVDK4GXA","2017-12-09 19:15:59.279","2","True","508"
"419149","4","Device Does NOT Limit Screen Time","This product is misrepresented by its description. It DOES NOT allow you to limit your kid's screen time. It only allows you to disable/filter internet access.\\n\\nIn terms of monitoring/tracking, it only tracks and limits the time your kid's spend on games that require internet access. It does not limit any apps that do not require internet access or apps that can be played in offline mode.  Worst of all, for online apps, when the restrictions take effect no message or warning appears to indicate why the app has ceased to function--the apps simply stop working and error messages begin to appear--which prompts complaints about non-functioning apps.\\n\\nBased on the description online and descriptions from friends that have this device, I was led to believe it was capable of fully disabling the devices when the time limit had been reached--this is not true. It does not limit screen time, just internet access.\\n\\nIf your kids exclusively play online games then this device might work for you, but otherwise, you will be disappointed. In terms of limiting internet access, the restriction settings built into iOS can provide many of the same limitations.\\n\\nUPDATE: After about a month of the limited functionality described above, it disconnected from my router and refuses to reconnect. Now it is a $100 doorstop.\\n\\nUPDATE:  The router issues seem to have resolved themselves and after a few weeks or rebooting the device.  Also, after a month of use Circle it became apparent that even though the device doesn't control screen time, screen time is a valuable commodity to my kids--more valuable to them than an allowance.  In the past few weeks, using the integration with Mothership and ChoreMonster I now have an effective token economy whereby my kids do chores to earn points that can be redeemed for time online and/or app purchases.  In the past week, my kids eagerly anticipate the running of the dishwasher, and eagerly do other chores, so they can obtain points in ChoreMonster to redeem.\\n\\nThe integration between Circle and Mothership is a bit cumbersome to setup--it would be great if it were a single app--you will find yourself constantly flipping between the two apps to keep your economy running.  Also, the integration is a bit buggy but works well enough to provide a rudimentary token economy.  Hopefully, they will get the bugs worked out with future releases.","[]","B019RC1EI8","B019RC1EI8","AGVR2GL6T4PURRL5L5XSTRB3QFSA","2017-04-28 01:22:06.000","4","True","508"
"411584","5","Watch for ghosts!","Ghost camera? Thanks to this camera, (and maybe a dead visiting relative) I have 5+ dozen videos of moving spheres of light that vary in size from a ping pong ball to a grapefruit. This only happens in low light (during the night) and the orbs move through walls, furniture etc., and the movement is never the same. Almost always its just one orb, but on one video there are 6 (!).  During one video, my wife and I are walking down the hall and an orb darts between us, yet we saw nothing until the next day when I checked the movement alerts. And, these round orbs have a very smooth and sometimes blinking movement unlike a moth (or a bat, once!). Sometimes they are fast and other times they move slowly, or dissapear and reappear. They come out of the walls, floor and ceiling or just appear and move down the hallway.\\nI have asked every tech person that comes to our home for a possible explanation, but none are offered. We also have 4 ADT hard wired cameras as well as other systems, and the ADT camera tech said he had never seen anything like this, but said it gave him the 'creeps'. An engineer friend thinks that its an algorithm issue with the software, but I challenged him on the completely random movements and differing sizes of the orbs, and he had no way to explain the inconsistent behavior. We live 800 feet off of the street, with a gated entry, and in the middle of the woods. It is very dark here and it is not reflected light from an outside source. We can go for weeks with no activity, but then sometimes it happens nightly.\\n\\nI tried to download and post one of the clips, an mp4 video (iOS based) to help get some answers from you fellow reviewers, but could not. Sorry.\\n\\nWe have had the camera in our dining room for a year and a half with absolutely no issues and are very happy with its performance.\\n\\nUPDATE! - Just bought another unit for our living room, and our ghost did not disappoint. It showed up on the very first night and went into the room and then glided back down the hallway (WTH?). I got this new camera on the Prime day promotion, and cannot get over the quality and ease of use for just $28.00. No, this is not a paid review. I really like this product!","[]","B01CW4AR9K","B01CW4AR9K","AH4CE7GPQQYJMKBVIQ67G2DIUWMQ","2017-09-02 10:14:12.903","2","False","508"

Fit great on my Honday Odyssey minivan headrest.  I used a criss cross pattern to tighen the straps.  They held tight and at a great viewing angle\\n4.  Included 2 remotes, wires that were long enough to reach from the cigarette lighter to the back.\\n5.  Speaker volume was good\\n6.

Happy to have purchased with them.\\n\\nCons:\\n1.  Medium Loud Static/interference sound coming out of the main unit headphone jack when headphones are plugged in (if no headphones were plugged in and we used players speakers there wasn't a problem).  We tried troubleshooting by switching out three different sets of headphones into the jack all three headphones created the same sound.  Next, we troubleshooted switching the dvd to the other player and then it had the same problem too with all three sets of headphones.  Conclusion: The sound came out of the jack to which the main player had headphones plugged into each time.  I made this description confusing but basically 1 out of the 2 would make the sound during the movie but not both at the same time.\\n2.  Didn't come with a case.  I don't leave it stored in my vehicle as I don't like having the cords everywhere.  So I would like a case or a description from the seller for a suggested protective case that fits all of the items together well and protects the screens.\\n3.  Doesn't come with two wall chargers.

"922390","5","Absolutely amazing in every way!","These are my first Bose noise-canceling headphones. So to start with, the noise canceling is amazing, literally. I got them for a 5 hour flight from PDX to NYC and holy cow do they make a difference with the jet engine noise. From what I can tell they are very impressive at eliminating sounds that are steady and of consistent frequency. So you can hear erratic sounds, like people talking, car horns, etc., but anything that's ongoing and the same sounding will be diminished by roughly 90%.\\n\\nSo 5-star point #2 is the sound quality. I consider myself an audiophile and have since the invention of the CD. I've had some high-end Sony studio monitor headphones in the past, and I gotta say, these Bose are hands-down better sounding. They have a very impressive frequency response. The low-lows are there, the clarity of all the assorted mids is there, the highs are crisp. These are truly amazing.\\n\\nAnd third, bluetooth. Icing on this very delicious cake! The quality of the bluetooth transmitted sound is by far the best from bluetooth I've heard on any device, and I have plenty. Add that to the fact that these headphones also work as a headset for phone calls. I've never had a great experience with bluetooth headsets for phone calls... until now. These are wonderful. They can hear me perfectly, and with the noise canceling and using both phones over both ears, I can hear everything they say with ease. I've used them on my noisy balcony in downtown Portland, a place where NO headset, even wired, worked well enough to use... the people on the other end always hear too much noise. Not the case with these.\\n\\nI had originally purchased a pair of $100 Sonys to replace my $350 Sonys, and was sorely disappointed (guess that should have been obvious!). I returned them here on Amazon and decided to just buck up and buy these. I am super pleased with that decision and cannot recommend these magnificent headphones enough!\\n\\nI also recently learned that the noise canceling technology used is patented by Bose. Being that it's pretty much the only technology that actually works, no other brand of noise canceling is even worth consideration. If that's your goal, be sure to try any Bose noise canceling headphones before deciding to go with another brand.","[]","B01E3SNO1G","B01EL7VTC0","AHW7LYLCV6IY64422NDSKPJY4AKQ","2017-01-10 02:40:45.000","2","True","508"
"441187","4","Long Term Review - 3 Years of Use","This is a long term review. I have had this mouse for 3 years, and it broke today. For the money, I believe that is pretty acceptable performance.\\n\\nThis mouse was used for a year in high intensity gaming for about two hours a day. Tens of thousands of clicks an hour. In the past two years, it has been at my desk for work, being used constantly, 8 hours a day. Not as intense use, but consistent.\\n\\nThe mouse itself still feels strong. The clicks are still crisp and all the lights and buttons still work flawlessly. I have no complaints about the mouse itself. It feels good in the hand and is much wider than the Logitech M510 (pictured), though it may be a bit &#34;low-profile&#34; for some who like to keep their hand arched more. I do not like the placement of the side buttons, my thumb regularly clicked them when I moved the mouse, keeping me from assigning them to useful commands in gaming. This could be due to my massive hands and fingers, or just poor hand placement. using the thumb rest on the side is extremely comfortable and I love that feature.\\n\\nThe transmitter is where this mouse falls short. The construction does not feel strong. The connection between the USB body and the plastic housing feels a bit weak. The contacts on the transmitter seem to have worn to the point where I can no longer get a reliable connection and the mouse constantly malfunctions. For the past month, I have had to remove the transmitter and reinsert it several times a day to reset the connection, and today, it got to the point where it wouldn't work for more than a few seconds before malfunctioning again. Every other wireless mouse works flawlessly, and no other devices malfunction in the same USB port. The malfunction occurs in every USB port I have, regardless of placement on docking station, monitor or hub. (In case you think this is PC or user error.) If I could just replace the transmitter, I believe the mouse would probably go another 2 years at my desk. Treat this piece with care.\\n\\nOverall, I am satisfied with the product for the price. It served me well, and even though it has failed, I may consider replacing it with another of the same. $22 for 3 years of service seems like a fair deal to me. Pictures below are current condition after 3 years of use.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HIQGpVDlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HIQGpVDlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HIQGpVDlL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71alx9CMMyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71alx9CMMyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71alx9CMMyL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rW-qMPjQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rW-qMPjQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rW-qMPjQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uzYdCwWeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uzYdCwWeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uzYdCwWeL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00DPC015E","B00DPC015E","AGTT6UOPGPJWZP2HP6LR27Z5MRYA","2017-01-23 15:59:45.000","25","True","508"

I did all the setup on my wife's Windows 7 laptop using the Foscam Equipment Search Tool (available download on the Foscam website).\\n\\nI am going to detail how I set it up to save you from trying to read the NVR online manual and to spare you going to the effort of hooking the NVR up to a monitor and using a mouse as described in their quick start instructions.\\n\\nI put my new WD Purple 2TB Surveillance Hard Disk Drive -WD20PURZ into the NVR box, attached a CAT cable to the NVR and Apple Airport Extreme router and turned the NVR on.  I set Windows Explorer as the default browser on her PC(the required plug-in does not work on a MAC), started on the Foscam equipment finder tool and then clicked on the NVR box (it found it very quickly) and started the setup process.  Then allowed Windows to load the plugin tool after logging in.  No need for a monitor or the mouse that came with the NVR.  Setting the cameras up was easy as they were found in the setup tool. The recordings can be viewed on the PC using the Equipment Search tool as the route into the NVR's control screens.  I use the OWLR iPhone app to remotely view my cameras - and it still works fine, if a little bit slower to load the camera images while the NVR is recording.\\n\\nIf the Foscam iPhone NVR app worked(read the app store reviews) I would rate this NVR 5 stars. As it stands, I have no ability to remotely view recordings. But, the NVR is up and running and now I have camera recordings.\\n\\nUpdate 2021:  the last of my Foscam cameras finally died and I happily disconnected this nvr and threw it and the camera in the garbage.

"83056","5","I absolutely love the Echo Show","I absolutely love the Echo Show!  Some thoughts:\\n\\n1. The screen is not too bright for use in your bedroom as an alarm clock.  Go to settings on the device. Tap display. Make sure Ambient Clock is turned on. Set Brightness Level to about 1/3 and make sure Adaptive Brightness is turned on.  Then use the Do Not Disturb feature (you can schedule this feature for every day at certain times, turn on manually from the screen, or turn on with your voice)  This is how I have mine set and I have no issue with the brightness level at night or during the day.\\n2.  The screen size is perfect for your desk, kitchen counter, or nightstand.  Some people have commented that the screen is small for watching movies or television shows which is true.  But remember, this not meant to be a TV.\\n3.  I am glad Amazon first came out with the Echo with no screen.  This forced me to get used to using my voice.  That took time to get used to since most of us are used to tapping on screens.  That being said, remember this is a voice activated device first, not a tablet.  That is why there are not many options to use the touchscreen.  However, I'm sure in the future Amazon will be adding more touch screen options.\\n4.  Amazon Echo Remote pairing - setup is different than on the other Echo devices.  Instead of going in the app to set up - go to Settings on the Echo Show, then go to Device Options, scroll down and you will see the Pair Amazon Echo Remote option.\\n5.  Having a screen enhances Alexa.  For example, ask for the weather today and Alexa tells you but also shows you more weather info for the week.\\n6.  I also purchased two Arlo Q cameras to work with the Alexa Show.  Setup was easy and the cameras are working seamlessly with the Show.  It takes about 6-8 seconds for the cameras to pull up on the Show but that was expected.  It takes my phone the same amount of time.\\n\\nIf you are on the fence about any of the Alexa devices, give yourself time to learn all she can do and to learn how she will fit into your life.  I haven't regretted my purchase.  And remember, Alexa is also learning all the time!","[]","B01J24C0TI","B01KIOU4EO","AH7AQGMFZSABNSKA7ALBJ7ZWVVZA","2017-06-30 13:25:20.360","2","True","508"
"669205","4","I wish I knew the inside diameter...","I buy a lot of tripod bags. The reviews and the product description drives me crazy. I don't care what make and model of tripod you have, I want to know what length it will comfortably fit, and if there's adequate room for rather bulky Manfrotto 410 &#34;gear&#34; heads on top of modest aluminum tripods. I bought 4 of another type and the length was great, but it wouldn't fit the head. The product description looks impressive but doesn't bother with the diameter of the thing up top. This bag is intriguing, due to the bulge, so I'll buy one and see if it fits. If not, back it goes. In my opinion, cheap bags like this are a bit of a crapshoot but will always save money over the more expensive brand names. Even the expensive bags fail in a number of ways. From the picture, this bag looks like a fantastic bargain for the price.  I just hope it will fit my gear. I'll try to edit this comment once I try one out.\\n***************\\nOK, I ordered 4 and they just arrived. If you look carefully, USA Gear has 2 bags that go to 35&#34;. This one is 21&#34;/35&#34; and the ones I ordered were 27&#34;/35&#34;. I need 31&#34; so I ordered the latter one that when compressed at the bottom, it is allegedly 27&#34;. Well, instead, somebody goofed and sent me 4 of the 21 inchers. For me time is money and I don't want to screw around with cheap stuff so I'm keeping them. They are cheap as hell, but they'll do OK protecting $400 tripods. If you need a rugged bag, go Manfrotto. Costs more but worth it. In order for a really good fit, I'll be putting the columns up around 5 inches on the tripods to insure they do not rattle around fore and aft. They do fit my tripods with gear heads well though. The picture and description shows a more rugged bag than what arrived. The zipper is cheap, and all handles will eventually fail. However the price is compelling, so I may buy one or two more as spares. They may say this is a padded bag, but compared to all other brands of padded bags, this brand is decidedly NOT padded.","[]","B009KUKZ3I","B086KX2D54","AGGHRQSDY3ZP6MI74LKSMV53HH4Q","2017-09-16 02:47:45.421","0","False","508"
"442960","2","Lots of great features, except sound quality.","First off i just want to say that purchasing headphones online is a very tricky endeavor. Mostly due to the fact that sound quality is so subjective and it depends deeply on each persons musical tastes. With that being said I have purchased lots of headphones over the years. I feel the same way about about headphones as my wife does her shoe collection, one can never have too many! Just because a pair of headphones are inexpensive does not necessarily mean that they are cheap and will sound bad. Two of my favorite headphones that I listen to quite frequently are the meelectronics HT-21 and I also like the soundbot sb221 (recent purchase). A couple of weeks before Christmas I noticed that my wife was using my Sennheiser HD 280 Pro closed back headphones to listen to an audio book on her Kindle HD 8. At that moment I though man it would be cool to get a pair of Bluetooth Closed Back headphones for my wife so that she wouldn't have to be tethered to her tablet. Of course it also gave me another excuse to try out a new pair of headphones. So off to the internet I go scouring through reviews and the one that kept coming back up positive feedback was the Photive BTH3. I currently own a Photive Bluetooth speaker that while the bass is not great it is still a good sounding little portable speaker. Needless to say I really wanted to like these headphones however the sound quality was a complete turn off. There is a high end roll off that starts at about 3k that makes things sound muffled. I tried to EQ it out however it ended up making everything sound very harsh and tinny. I am not a Bass Head however the low end was decently represented. Please keep end mind that I am comparing these to Meelectronics and the Sound Bot headphones using a flat EQ and not the expensive Sennheiser's  I mentioned earlier. The only other negative was sound leakage. People have mentioned this issue in online reviews and once again this is another subjective issue. However, when I tested these out around my wife she quickly got very annoyed. When I checked  the volume level I noticed that it was only at about 50%. Everything else that you read about these cans online is true. The build quality appears to be decent, they are relatively comfortable, they look really cool in person, and they connected almost instantly to my Motorola G5 Plus cell phone. I am very disappointed that this did not work out and  have already started the return process.","[]","B00HTPHK5W","B0C3GSXJDJ","AGKDKD32Y7BGSL4F6WKFIUWVCS4Q","2017-12-31 00:36:19.947","5","True","508"

I will check frame rate when i get back from vacation because I doubt its ability in recording 4k at 50/60 frame rate.\\n\\nIf anyone doubts my review, I will be more than happy to post proven video, but now i am in vacation till end of oct 2017, and have no other camera except this piece of junk.\\n\\n------ Date: 24-Mar-2018. This is my addition to my original comment.\\nStill nothing changed on camera behaviour even with latest firmware. It just suddenly records by itself sometimes, and also turns on by itself.\\nAlso, night recording is horrible. The worst camera ever in night recording. Poor resolution during night recording.\\nI was once inside theater showing some dance and colorful lights, and failed to distinguish colors. absolute failure. the video looks like of a 240p resolution. I took the video on 4k 50Hz, and played it on several 4k TVs but no luck.\\nNight recording by my old Gopro 5 hero was excellent and far far far better than this Gopro 6.\\n\\nFor outdoor recording under sunlight:\\nGopro 6 is very good for videoing outdoor during day light. This is the only thing this camera is good at. Though, I haven't seen much difference on recording quality between gopro 5 @ 4k 30 frames and gopro 6 @ 4k 50/60 frames.","[]","B074X5WPC5","B08R3D8R9W","AFOXPJFKEDJXLVDIWNE5WTF6ULIQ","2017-10-12 00:51:50.986","55","False","508"
"347783","5","Excellent Sound, Very Comfortable and Priced to fit your budget. NO Really It Is!","I'm giving this headset full 5 Stars because the Pro's far out way the con's and the cons are more of my own dislikes and less an issue with the product.\\nPROS: Price on this is great at around $25, VERY COMFORTABLE TO WEAR. I love how it goes under your ear and not over the top, this design is comfortable to wear for hours at a time and can easily go from my Panasonic VoIP Cordless Phone system to plugging into my cell phone with the provided adapter that converts it from a 2.5 MM to the standard 3.5 MM (I hope I got those measurements correct but regardless  it's what makes it compatible with almost all phones and your computer!)  The sound quality is amazing and I like the adjustable volume and mute button that is on the cord for you to easily access.\\nCONS: As I said before this has more to do with me and less about the product itself, but I figured I'd share anyways. So in the defense of this product, I'm going to be up front and say, (If I wanted a wireless headset then I should have just bought a wireless one!) The truth is I did and I have posted a review on that also. The Con for me is there are so many times when I forget that I am tethered to a phone or other device and without thinking when I get up to move, I always come close to snapping the wire, while at the same time jerking my head back like I've gotten which last. Very embarrassing when others are watching! So again this is less of an issue with the headset and more of an issue with me.  That said, I really don't have any other complaints about it.  I tend to go back and forth between my Bluetooth cordless headset which I love and this Plantronics which plugs into my DECT Panasonic Cordless which I keep in my pocket in an effort to not hang myself! Given that my Cordless does not have bluetooth, this headset is the perfect match!  It also fits into the price range that seems to be the new normal of under $50.00 for actual quality! I hope this is helpful and remember if you don't like it, Amazon.com seems to have an incredible return policy that truly takes the risk out of seeing if this or any product is really for you!\\nEJ Mandigo-Kneszewski - SiteCast Solutions & Technology, LLC","[]","B000I4RMOU","B000I4RMOU","AHQBJGRNIJ65AAIULLPECAINYFEQ","2017-02-11 06:18:16.000","0","True","508"
"24249","3","For the money, it just misses the mark","Pro's:\\n- fast boot up. Pretty much the only reason I'm thinking of keeping it\\n- Bluetooth music displays artist/track info\\n- responsive screen\\n- improved sound quality over stock head unit\\n- Equalizer is more than 3 bars like some head units\\n- Volume knob. Volume knobs are just simply the best, and its a shame more units don't come with them. This one has a good feel\\n- No audio problems with bluetooth calling, other than being told its quiet. But quality is good\\n\\nCons:\\nLet's star with the three biggest cons that make me question returning this unit because of dealing with it on a daily basis:\\n- Every time you shut the car off, it reverts to radio and disconnects bluetooth from phone. Wouldn't be a huge deal, except I need a special adapter for my jeep antenna to plug into the unit, so all I have is static. Reconnecting to the phone takes ~10-15 seconds and bluetooth music is not a selectable option that entire period, so you get blasted with static the whole time you're waiting.\\n- Once bluetooth music works, it skips the first 2 seconds of every song. Even if you rewind manually to the start, it somehow still doesn't capture the first two seconds. This is with a samsung galaxy s6 android/spotify\\n- Mutes music when you go into reverse with backup camera. Why? You know how annoying that is when parallel parking into a tight spot? and the music cuts in an out?\\n- The preset equalizer settings all sound terrible and muffled except &#34;rock&#34;, but rock has too much bass and suffers distortion. I set the exact same settings in user equalizer but with less bass, but the sound experience is less rich across the board. Even with bass equal, it should sound the same, but it does not. This is with &#34;loudness off&#34;, loudness turned on is useless and distorted.\\n- I have been unable to get mirror link to work. One problem, even if I get it to work, there will always be a USB cable coming out the front of the unit. They really should have opted for a rear USB port to keep the clean look.","[]","B00T3QC3JS","B07Z8RQZB3","AHYUL547I5D2GLWXSRAPSKREKECQ","2017-06-26 17:08:42.888","6","True","508"
"533608","2","Adhesive failure in 2 days. First issue in over a decade with Egrip","Update: one of the larger strips has come loose so many times I'm not sure rinsing it will recover the adhesive. I'm still a backer of the product but this one seems a dud. Whether because a bad batch of adhesive backing or perhaps it's the heavy duty silicone on this variety which has deeper ribs to grip, I don't know. Regardless it's an expensive product considering what it is and does IF it doesn't stick as it's supposed to.\\nFive star review should egrips step up and replace them. It's not a threat or a bribe. I've just been that pleased in the past that if they stick properly I'd be completely happy.\\n\\nI've used egrips on a little bit of everything, dating back to my Palm Treo. Yes, boys and girls, that was almost 15 years ago. I've really been happy with having this film on all my phones over the years as it is extremely effective at giving my bear paws something to grab onto. I added it to my laptop to give grip when carrying it around. a few strips on my desk to prop my phone in place. A few dots under my trackball. My wife added some underneath her keyboard so it wouldn't slide around anymore. So, you see, I was excited to get a new sheet of this to put on my newly purchased laptop.\\nWhen this product arrived, i was impressed. As it mentioned in the description, it is heavy duty. the ribs are deeper and the silicone is thicker.\\nthe unfortunate downfall is that the adhesive isn't up to the job. When I was applying the strips, i cleaned my hands with soap and water, then hand sanitizer. I applied a bit more of sanitizer to the laptop lid and bottom and rubbed it around until it evaporated. Then i stuck the strips on top and bottom edges of the top and bottom of the laptop case.\\n\\nTwo days later, they're flopping around. I've never ever had egrip do that and it's disappointing. I'm hoping the manufacturer sees my review and rectifies the issue, perhaps with a replacement sheet of strips. I've spend hundreds on this stuff over the years and recommended to dozens of people. I keep a few of the misc. size sheets in my office file cabinet in case i have a need.\\n\\nI can't recommend these HD strips, based on my experience.","[]","B00PM6L7OK","B09XGFLFL3","AEQJQNK6K3YTS6JKRVTSMFGYZUXA","2017-11-28 16:50:07.747","5","True","508"

"294081","4","Great in-ear Headphones for $20","So, I have used these headphones for a couple days. Below are my findings:\\n\\nPackaging\\nThe headphones come in a nice, small box. They have small, medium, and large earbud cushions. They also have a small carrying pouch. The only downside to this pouch is that it does not really pull closed with the strings. I would prefer it either have a magnet close or just a thinner cloth bag that actually closes. I could see someone dropping the earphones out of the bag if not careful. I will probably just keep the earphones in my backpack to carry with me. Beyond that it has a simple user manual and a card for feedback to send back to the manufacturer.\\n\\nFit and Finish\\nI chose the smallest of the 3 as I have smaller ear canals. They were quite comfortable using them for over an hour yesterday at the gym and a couple hours today. They also stay put relatively well if you choose the right size for you.\\nThe earphones themselves are made of aluminum and feel weighty enough for the price. They do not feel cheap, and they are small. The cord is braided fabric and time will tell if they hold up to regular use.\\nThe earphones have an in-line microphone that allows you to click twice to move to the next song or hold to bring up whatever voice assistant you have on your phone. I do not know of any other functions.\\n\\nSound\\nThe sound these produce is great for $20! I compared them to a couple other pairs of earphones and they are as clear or clearer than all of them. The only ones to best them are the AKG branded earphones I received with my Galaxy S8+.\\nThe earphones are slightly bass heavy, but not overly so. Vocals come through as clear and never really seemed exceptionally muddled at any point.\\n\\nDownsides\\nThe only cons I can think of are the bag closing and the fact that the in-line microphone does not control volume that I could figure out. This would be a nice touch.\\n\\nValue\\nI think the earphones represent a real value for the price paid. There are a lot of options on the market, surely. I think you won't be disappointed if you are looking for tangle-free simple earphones that sound great.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716XY1kuJ1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716XY1kuJ1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716XY1kuJ1L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fZOjgC13L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fZOjgC13L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fZOjgC13L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8103lgilUbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8103lgilUbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8103lgilUbL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811yiQRrFvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811yiQRrFvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811yiQRrFvL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B076DFDR4Y","B076DFDR4Y","AECEFOIQUYBYDFAYN2ECXFPAWLFQ","2017-12-10 20:24:29.865","2","True","508"
"972475","3","Batteries Nicely Packaged, Spec'd to OEM requirement, but internal Quality?","Revised product review as of Sept. 27, 2017.  First review was a 1-Star due to the battery received immediately NOT taking a charge, and messages from the Laptop PC reporting &#34;that the battery was NO Good needed replaced&#34;.  Thus a defective battery.  It was returned for an Amazon credit of the same.  After this I purchased another battery (to OEM specs) from Amazon and installed it - that battery allowed the PC to once again work normally.  Now in recent weeks - after a long delay - the original Amazon Seller contacted me directly and offered to replace the defective battery with what they said would be a personally tested good one directly applicable to the OEM specs for my PC.  I advised the seller that I purchased another battery and did not need their replacement.  However, the Amazon seller wanted me to be happy, to try another battery from them sent free, and also revise my original review.  I finally agreed to try another battery.  I received this second battery on Sept 25, 2017, it was properly marked as per OEM specs (however completely made in China vs. Japan Cells) , allowed the replacement battery to fully charge up while NOT using the PC, and tried it after charging.  However, this replacement battery DOES NOT allow the LED Charging/Charged indicator light to even LIGHT UP.  The detailed status and illustration given by the PC's programming  itself shows that this replacement battery was charging only up to 96% - but discharging at 2%-6% quickly even during idle - with no real PC usage, and all while still plugged into AC adapter power, and still NO indicator LED working!  Thus it is the opinion of this consumer that - Albeit that the batteries received by from seller DO APPEAR to be new (packaged normally), and no signs of pre-usage, etc., that the batteries themselves may be NEW, however, they may have been manufactured some time ago, and thus just do not function properly.  As soon as I reinstalled the battery purchased earlier this month from the other seller all indicators, and battery internal status returned to normal.  I am now giving this Amazon Seller at least a 3-Star rating vs. a 1-Star because they DO SEEM to care, and have tried.  It may not be their fault for products that may not be as fresh as THEY feel they're providing, or fully function as they are supposed  to.","[]","B01N0WCBMA","B01N0WCBMA","AGUN3OPZTKXUYQG4PHBQ4JN4UVXA","2017-09-03 23:15:57.303","8","True","508"
"769335","4","User friendly cameras","Camaras are very easy to operate and install. Software and apps work great. There are a lot of false alarms for tree shadows on windy days and we have a bat at night that triggers motion and we get about 10 clips a day of &#34;the bat&#34; but it also catches every car, person and potential threat which we like, having been victims of several breakins recently. Our biggest complaint would be The cameras going offline for 10 minutes or more periodically thru the day This is more than likely due to poor internet service from Comcast and not an issue with the Nest product. I made sure an upgraded my modem So that it has multiple upload and download channels and I also bought a wifi signal repeater to insure each Camara has a strong connection to the home network we supposedly pay for 10mb upload/25mb download speed we occasionally get that performance but it's not consistent and we don't bother complaining to them because it would be more useful to tell a tree stump. Other complaints are similar to other customers the cable end on the camera cord is just way to thick and requires drilling a 3/4&#34; hole thru the side of your house if you want to run the wires inside, without that thick end I could have easily fit the wire thru a 1/4&#34; hole. Hopefully  enough of us complaining will result in a redesign on that,  otherwise installation is great. The field of view is very wide, images are very clear when zoomed out but get very very grainy when zooming In. there is an important trade off because of the frog-eye GoPro like wide angle lenses if you need to read a license plate or identify a persons face the subject of interest really needs to be very close (within about 10ft) of the camera. In order to capture a clear image of the thief the camera really needs to be mounted down where that same thief can probably damage the camera but I suppose by that point you may have a picture of them on the server. If you mount it up high out reach you probably won't be able to clearly see the face. But you will know when they came and how they got to you. So far we like them, but I would highly recommend you check your internet speed and wifi range before purchasing, if your performance is less than what nest recommends I would check with your ISP and find out how much more it will cost you to upgrade and factor that into the total cost of your system.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61LRWfvwGIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61LRWfvwGIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61LRWfvwGIL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61NnLa0PUQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61NnLa0PUQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61NnLa0PUQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61V759JiiCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61V759JiiCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61V759JiiCL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cu8x48isL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cu8x48isL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cu8x48isL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01I3I9L8M","B0B42NYTZZ","AHATGUSP3TA7JGX6QMLYSHTYGATA","2017-05-10 02:57:18.000","4","True","508"
"874308","3","A good ""no-frills"" music player, but has its drawbacks....","I really didn't have high expectations for this thing to begin with, but it turned out ok. Sounds just like any other music players, fairly easy operating system (I use it in my car, I can skip songs on shuffle without taking my eyes off the road).\\n\\nTHE BIGGEST DRAWBACKS:\\n-Every song file includes the file type displayed on the screen (example .mp3 or .flac) which makes it look unprofessional/clunky\\n\\n-if you download your music (or even rip it from a CD) the titles of the songs may be messed up. For example: if you download a album such as &#34;Best of Kansas&#34;, it may appear in the title of each song. This means that when the song is playing, those are the first words you will see, and the letters dont scroll fast enough on the screen for you to see the song until several seconds later (which is really annoying since you have to change the song names, unlike with Apple products where you can just drag the files over and it will format it for you)\\n\\n-LASTLY, which is the most annoying part......\\nIf you plan to use an SD card in the mp3 player, don't plan on using the internal storage space. This device does not integrate files from both of them, and as a result you can't even view all your artists and songs in the same place. You will have to go into the seperate file folders to view your songs, which just doesn't make sense.... it's NOT intuitive.... You can still put stuff on the internal memory.. but keep this in mind. I'm glad I got the 32GB because I already have 16gb of music on the sd card, and not being able to use the internal storage if I only got a 16gb would piss me off...\\n\\nOverall... I really don't want to ruin the product or company's rep. I like the music player and it works for what I use it for.. but it sure is not an apple product. If you want a &#34;no-frills&#34; music player, this isn't bad for the price. You do have to take into consideration, however, the drawbacks that I described. If you don't mind these drawbacks, then this music player will be perfect for you.","[]","B01N4J874E","B01N4J874E","AELSD5KLBZJ7P7QSNTIKK5N7HTAA","2017-10-12 00:18:10.088","2","True","508"
"86111","4","Nice little kit","Nice little kit, particularly the included controllers which are fairly close to the NES originals.  Purchasing the parts separately would have cost me $15 more, and wouldn't have come pre-loaded with Retropie, so this was an easy choice.  Applying the heat sinks and getting the board solidly inserted into the case was a bit fiddly. but only took ~5 minutes to get it setup and booted.\\n\\nI don't much care for the clear case (&#34;um, look honey, I got you a PCB for XMas!&#34;) but this kit had the best combination of quality and reasonable price at the time of my purchase.  The kit itself has worked flawlessly, but seeing as the vendor sells multiple kits in varying case styles it would be nice to be able to mix/match them a bit.  I hung this on the wall with heavy duty velcro immediately beneath our TV, and while it has a certain geek cachet to it I wouldn't mind a black or glossy white option.\\n\\nFor those new to Retropie and emulators you should expect to do some tweaking, at least for some games, to get good performance.  This isn't a strike against this kit... that's just typical of emulating 20-30 year old tech.  I spent around 8 hours loading my old games and tweaking settings but now have nearly 80 classic games spanning NES, SNES, N64, and C64 all in one tiny box on my wall.  Roughly 1/3 of those games required tinkering with various emulators to get them to run well.  C'est la vie...  General Retropie forums around the 'net indicate some folks have trouble running N64 games with this type of setup... no problems for me, however.  N64 games (Golden Eye 007!, Mario Kart 64!, Ocarina of Time!, Star Fox 64! Banjo Kazooie!) run well on this hardware.\\n\\nI added USB extensions to the controllers so we could play from a distance and an inline USB clicky-switch on the power feed so I don't have to unplug it to shut down.  Other than that this kit had everything I needed for a great surprise gift.  Way more flexible than an NES Classic for only a little more money, with the added bonus I could actually purchase this at list price during this decade.","[]","B01J4HTOS8","B01J4HTOS8","AFQRW7ZRHHK3RF7HFJJMMNTPTSWQ","2017-01-11 02:11:55.000","54","True","508"
"397352","4","Great product if you have the correct work flow sorted out.","The files are huge, well beyond what you want to handle in any post-processing operation. Count on 2 GB for a 44 minute TV show at 720p/30 FPS using a minimal data rate. This is good enough quality to view on a 35”+ TV. That will jump to over 8 GB for an hour of 1080 programming. The files consist of largely uncompressed video saved in .mp4 format, so they stream easily on slower systems and are directly playable in VLC, Quicktime, PLEX, WindowsMedia etc on either Windows or Mac without any conversion being required.\\n\\nWhen setting up the box for the first time, use the remote and raise the sound volume to the max.\\n\\nIf you use the remote and record directly to the supplied USB thumb drive, it will become corrupt after a few recordings and must then be reformatted on your PC as FAT32 or NTFS. Anything on that thumb drive may be lost, including your current recording, so I have a certain reluctance to attach a large hard drive directly to the USB outout port.\\n\\nIf you must use thumb drives, FAT32 format will be more stable, but all of your files will be broken up into 2 GB chunks. ClonerAlliance provides a utility to join and edit the segments, but file size makes this largely impractical. Continue to use NTFS and the files will not be chopped up but the corruption issue will come back sooner.\\n\\nIf you want a bulletproof work flow, attach a 2 GB NTFS hard drive to your router and share that drive. Using the free ClonerPro Helper app on your PC to record to the network drive will bypass the file corruption issue and enable instant access to your library on another networked machine. The PC used to record does not have to be anything swift; a Thinkpad from 2012, Win 7/32, with 2 gig of RAM does the job quite adequately and provides a monitor of what’s going on.\\n\\nSharing a router-networked drive will also sidestep some NTFS and Windows compatibility issues for Mac users by granting full read/write permissions.\\n\\nAs others have mentioned, ClonerAlliance seems committed to great support and has a liberal refund policy. Firmware updates seem to be just a few months apart so I expect the file handling issues may be resolved soon.","[]","B012T1D0IG","B012T1D0IG","AGB7U4HQ7WOSUGDI6QCCQMSFEY7A","2017-08-23 19:58:14.292","6","True","508"
"679645","4","The first clock/radio I can recommend","My iHome that I purchased because it had an iPhone charging dock was dying on me, so I started looking for a good clock radio. I don't know that I ever owned one that I truly love. You couldn't read the iHome display unless you were looking directly at it, for example, but the sound was awesome. Well I use android now, and will never buy a phone that requires a custom dock again. So I started looking for a good replacement. After weeks of fretting, I finally tried a cheapo and returned it. I spent more for this, but I love it. I can honestly say this is the first clock radio that I have owned that I can recommend.\\nThe buttons are easy to push and easy to find, unlike my old iHome. The display is hugely bright, but there is a dial on the bottom that you can turn it off, AND still read the time in daylight! How cool is that, iHome. The atomic clock function is spotty, but that is a weak signal. Set the time manually, and you won't have to fret over daylight savings time because it has function to +1 hour the timezone. If you use the atomic set, give it lots of time to get a signal and it will set on its own. But don't expect to have the signal, say on daylight saving day and have the clock set itself. That is the only reason I give it 4 stars over 5.\\nAbout the display again. There is a button on the bottom right that will turn the backlight on, punch it in the middle night and not only can you read the time, unlike iHome, but you have a nightlight. It is that bright.\\nThe nap, sleep, and alarm functions are almost self-explanatory on setting, which is how a clock radio should be.\\nIt does not take batteries for a backup, but I have unplugged and moved the radio several times and it has kept my settings and the time. It even flashed a message on the display that it had lost power. I guess it has a  battery or capacitor keeping it alive without power. I have not had an extended power outage, but I can tell you that my battery backed iHome lost time over extended outages. (So you have a phone, right? I mean to see the time in a power outage.)\\nIf it had a weather radio function, it would be perfect.","[]","B000QUGKRQ","B09439V7MB","AFBDF3Q2KLQJ2LXBOO7H2L2ME2WA","2017-03-26 20:42:48.000","9","True","508"
"559061","5","M50x + Fiio E17 = HAPPY EARS","I was in the market for Headphones in the 100$ ~ 150$ range, so I started reading reviews (like an smart consumer) and It came down to the DT 770 Pro 80ohm and the M50x's. I brought the DT 770s from ebay for $127, a really good price, I got them and I was very impressed with the mids and highs and they are very &#34;flat&#34; (a reason why audiophiles love them for that price range). The sound stage was robust and present in every track I played, that wasn't my problem with them. It was when I listened to Hip-hop or any other music that had a deep bass line around the 50hz ~ 80hz area. I tuned my E17 to even out the bass and even my audio drivers on Win10 to give it more of a punch in the 50hz range.\\n\\nLong story short, I wasn't COMPLETELY happy. A week later I ordered the M50x's and Boy-Oh-Boy am I a happy camper. It plays EVERY genre wonderfully! NO! It's not as flat as the DT 770 Pro (definitely a bit boosted in the lower frequencies, hence that's why it handles thumping bass way better than the 770's) and it has the slightest reduction in overall soundstage, but the trade off to me was worth it. It's not all about bass with these headphones, they are extremely versatile especially with the E17. When I listen to Jimi Hendrix I tune Bass and Treble to 0 and turn up the gain to 6~12 or when I want to listen to J. Cole or Kendrick Lamar I turn the bass to 6~8 and bang away.\\n\\nI can't express how happy I am with the M50's, these a game changer. These aren't for true audiophiles (&#34;Too much color&#34; is how it's described) and they categorized the M50's to be &#34;FUN&#34; sounding headphones; they're right about that!  :)\\nI ordered a replacement cable (better quality, more sturdy) and I have new ear pads in the mail (I'll update the pictures when it arrives)\\n\\nBTW, YES I'm still keeping the 770's those are the best overall Closed-back headphones in the sub $200 range.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+UGOuPvAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+UGOuPvAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+UGOuPvAL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YL2kwa4-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YL2kwa4-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YL2kwa4-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eqKfsJFBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eqKfsJFBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eqKfsJFBL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rIRS28ULL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rIRS28ULL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rIRS28ULL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00HVLUR86","B0BD99CPHB","AHDJK6IUIC2UWKQYDPZYFIA4PSRQ","2017-08-25 18:43:43.287","0","False","508"
"770750","3","Super easy to use, but a gamble on quality.","Super easy to use. Plugged in and it worked no software no anything. The charging port is a little off but since I think it's actually my cable 4 stars.\\nUPDATE: I was initially really happy with this controller and managed to play 549 hours of games with the first one I ordered. Sadly the Left Analog stick button failed so I promptly ordered another one. Both analog sticks had a slight grinding feeling to them and within a week the same left stick issue occurred, so I returned and ordered another which also felt liable to break so I decided just to upgrade to an xbox one s controller and my god... I did not realize what I was missing. After playing with the xbox one s control I realize this ZD one has really, really unresponsive analog sticks to start. If you play mostly first person shooters I really cannot recommend this control... Spend the extra $20 and get an xbox 1 controller.\\n ALTHOUGH the greatest thing about this control is it is wireless and DOES NOT require any peripherals to get going. Microsoft is definitely milking people on that. I am using a wired control now because I didn't want to buy another $50 of battery packs and adapters to use the already $45 controller...\\nSo all in all this control is a gamble. My first one was a survivor; it survived a few smashes onto my desk and 1 throw at the hard floor thanks to Hollow Knight, and The Evil Within Chapter 6 burning house on Nightmare.. (Some of you will understand). the second one I would give a 1 or 2 stars as it barely lasted over a week and maybe 12 hours of use (but the charging port worked on that one), and the third i didn't want to even bother with after a few minutes of use...\\n\\nPros:\\n-Plug and play usb wireless, works right out of the box, no peripherals required.\\n-Awesome Grippy portions that the official xbox controls totally lack.\\n-Holds a charge for a really long time.\\n-Low Cost\\n\\nCons:\\n-Poor quality build. Besides the analog stick issue, the charging port had to be wedged up on the first one I ordered just to make it charge.  -Buttons feel &#34;grindy&#34; sometimes.\\n-Really low sensitivity on analog sticks, very difficult to aim precisely.","[]","B01HBKLIJ8","B01HBKLIJ8","AGF26UKQNPORCOPSBULHYO6CXU4A","2017-03-12 04:10:00.000","1","True","508"

I upgraded the RAM to 32GB, added a 1TB m.2 2280 SSD, and 2 2TB FireCUDA drives. The mobo only has one slot for an additional drive, so I needed to use this: https://www.amazon.com/DiGiYes-Universal-Second-Ultrabay-Adapter/dp/B018S2N5NU/ This drivebay adapter is a perfect fit, although I needed to slightly modify the little metal frame piece it comes with to make it fit perfectly (bent it into place).\\n\\nI do a major amount of video and audio production work, and this laptop is keeping up with it all just fine. I noticed a huge amount of extra processing power in Pro Tools, as well as Adobe Premiere and After Effects (compared to my old rig, an Asus G74SX).\\n\\nThis laptop idles in performance mode with overclock around 40C for both the CPU and GPU, but can run fairly hot while rendering video or playing games. I've seen the CPU peak at 90C but normally hangs out in the 80C range sustained while gaming. I picked up a New Tree Bee laptop cooler, which picks the laptop up and into a slanted position off the desk, and it at least makes me feel better about brutalizing it even if it doesn't do much. Internal fans max out at 6k RPM, and the laptop has a nice max speed fan toggle button regardless of the software setting you have running. It takes the computer a while to &#34;rev up&#34; but it seems to be working as intended.\\n\\nPUBG runs decently well on this computer, averaging around 70ish FPS on the ultra video settings... Better frames can be achieved with optimized settings from Nvidia Geforce Experience, or using Reshade as your post-processor. The new Tomb Raider gets a score of an average of 127FPS on ultra video settings, which may be a better indicator of what an optimized game will get you. Don't play many games due to time, but it seems like it can handle its own even with only the 1060 6GB chip in it.\\n\\nI'll update down the road once I really break this thing in.","[]","B06XCM63K2","B06XCM63K2","AHS63XSMWWQGSN2Z7UVZ7DBQNW6A","2017-08-21 05:52:56.290","15","True","508"
"852624","5","Sleek, lightweight, speedy and great for what it is. Know the limitations before you buy and you'll be very happy!","Nearly three months ago I purchased my first Chromebook with three goals:\\n1. To lighten the load of working from home by replacing an older Elitebook with limited batttery life with something more portable.\\n2. To create more content for my position by having a computer with full keyboard on me at all times.\\n3. To lessen my dependency on the hunched over use of my android smartphone at all hours of the day by having this around.\\n\\nSo far, I'm extremely pleased with this purchase. I've been so impressed with the battery life of this machine. I regularly get two full days of 5+ hours of use out of it with no need to charge. Charging is fast and efficient as well. I rarely have to plug it in for over a few hours to reach 100% battery. It's extremely lightweight and easy to carry around with me in my backpack and it is operational within seconds of opening. I have it set to pair with my android phone via bluetooth to automatically unlock it when it senses my phone nearby, so I am able to be creating content or looking something up within seconds of grabbing this out of my bag. The small keyboard fits my petite hands nicely and I quickly adjusted to the clever Chromebook specific gestures on the trackpad. In fact, I found them so intuitive that I find myself missing them on my larger, more powerful laptop.\\n\\nThe processor excels at managing multiple windows and tabs open at a time in Chrome. It does show it's limitations when handling media files from an SD card or USB - they can be a little slow to load thumbnails and such. But I knew that this wouldn't be my media PC in any regard when I purchased it. I knew that this would be primarily used for content generation via Facebook, Wordpress, and Google Docs and it works extremely well for all of those purposes.\\n\\nI tend to use headphones when I'm working rather than use the built-in speakers. The couple of occasions I have had to use the speakers showed an adequate amount of sound for a small audience, although I would not use this for a presentation or anything like that.\\n\\nMy only nitpick would be that I would love if the charger were not proprietary. Having a micro USB charger would have made this a perfect on the go machine as a powerbrick could easily provide power for a full day of use away from electricity.","[]","B00VUV0MG0","B071JY6ZYN","AFQ5N6MJEFILSVFAJHGSXIOBHE7A","2017-01-23 20:32:49.000","1","True","508"
"124832","3","Corrupts SD Card Due to Poor Battery Monitoring, but Otherwise OK","In its many renditions, I find this a fantastic camera.  So, why less than five stars?  Significant flaws.\\n\\nThe worst feature is the battery minder, which leads to a bad result.  The battery indicator icon has just two levels - full and low.  No effort to have as many as four segments, or something as clear as a &#34;percentage full&#34; indication, like a typical cell phone.  Who even knows what &#34;full&#34; and &#34;low&#34; even mean.  Based on the bad result that follows, I doubt the Nikon does.\\n\\nThe camera first corrupted the card by losing 50 images, then proceeded to finally decide that the battery was low.  Woulda, coulda, shoulda been a good idea for the camera to decide to quit scribbling on the card before doing a half-complete write.\\n\\nNikon customer service, which is sometimes good, was simply annoying in this case.  First CSR could not listen, second was quick to blame the card itself as being not on the short list of &#34;pre-tested&#34; card makers Nikon keeps.  I tried to explain that Nikon was responsible for the poor battery indication and monitoring design.  Nothing good came of the conversation, except that I'll use an approved Sandisk card in future do that the Nikon CSR can't &#34;cop an attitude&#34; in future, trying to pass the blame along.\\n\\nThe other feature that could be enhanced is the grip.  As other reviews indicate, the shape and surface of the camera does not take advantage of the &#34;keyhole-shape&#34; a.k.a. &#34;L-shape&#34; that has been popular for years.  A quick fix is to glue rubber from a bike tube to the front with rubber cement.  That's an easy fix.\\n\\nAside from the card corruption and battery monitoring issue, the camera is great.  New model is superior to S33 in power-on speed, which was itself a marked improvement over S32.  Durability of camera is just OK.  Two of four of mine have failed completely, one within warranty.\\n\\nDespite its flaws, I'll keep it.","[]","B01N1YNVMH","B01N4KPQO7","AEL7ZM7RMHK6UHJ72JADXBK7FKJA","2017-04-19 22:44:46.000","2","False","508"
"180686","2","Fantastic speaker for TV while it worked","Update:  while it worked the AB40 really was a good sound base.  However after about a year and a half it developed random popping noises that were so distracting I couldn’t stand it. Fluance customer service was great - they had me ship mine back and they sent me a replacement. It worked fine for several months and then randomly started making awful loud, deep buzzing noises and each time it happened it shut itself off.  And then one day it turned itself on making that deep buzz (I had put the remote away because I’d gone back to temporarily using the TV’s internal speakers so I didn’t accidentally turn it on) and after a few seconds of buzzing it shut itself off. Frankly it was kind of spooky - sort of like it was alive and begging to be put out if its misery! I obliged by unplugging and disconnecting it and then bought a sound bar instead. Had to build a riser for my TV but the sound bar works well and sounds good - and was a lot less expensive than the Fluance (which has come way down in price since I bought mine in 2017). I can’t recommend this sound base now - it just isn’t reliable.\\n\\nI couldn't be happier with this speaker. It replaced a first generation Bose Solo that finally died. I just wasn’t sure I wanted another Bose and as I was reading articles about sound bases (I didn’t want a sound bar) the Fluance AB40 kept popping up in reviews. I decided to take a chance and I’m so glad I did. This is a very powerful speaker and even at high volume I can’t notice any distortion at all. It sounds great! And it looks good, too. The wood cabinet is impressive.  I did have a little bit of an issue with setup. At first I couldn’t get any sound from the TV (I knew the speaker worked because I tried it with Bluetooth). I had to go to the Fluance website to discover that the AB40 requires that Dolby digital be turned off on your TV and I then had to search online to figure out how to do it (my TV doesn’t have anything called a Dolby digital setting). But I found out how to do it and then it worked. I am very pleased with this speaker and it does sound richer than my old Bose did.","[]","B01MTEHUCO","B01MTEHUCO","AGW7PALQ3BAFYBAA7LOSH5E54GSA","2017-12-09 14:58:14.210","1","True","508"
"755282","3","They do their job. Things to consider for first time buyers","I own the Razer mechanical chroma x keyboard... this things a LOUD board but I'd reccomend it to everyone. These rings do their job with eliminating the bottoming out noise but either way if you have this keyboard you will hear alot of noise due to the mechanical switches. Razer makes their own switches so if you have the green updated switches most likely you ll hear almost the same amount of noise.\\n\\nWhat's nice is this pack comes with a key puller, brush, lots of rings, a soft cloth, and a pouch. The brush is nice if you don't have a can of compressed air to clean your board off. It's small and flexible which is nice to have. Everyone loves soft cloths for their tablets or cell phone screens so there's a plus.. you can use it to white the top of your keys off. The pouch is ok...it's annoying because they used a very soft stale suede material that can catch alot of dust and lint for the outside.. not exactly the kind of pouch I'd want to keep in my keyboard bag. The more dirt in my bag means the more dirt and lint in my keyboard.\\n\\nSecondly, I feel like the rings actually make my keys feel stale. Without the rings I may get noise due to bottoming out the switch but at least I feel a fluid motion with every actuation. On the bright side (no pun intended) my light system is unchanged due to these transparent rings. If you buy these the light penetrates where as if you bought black ones they d probably lessen the brightness a tad. So things to consider when buying this pack...\\n\\nWhat's louder? The switch or the bottoming out?\\nIf it's the switch then I'd personally just live with it because the switch noise won't change.\\n\\nDoes your keyboard have rgb lighting?\\n\\nDo I care about the feel of each key press?\\n\\nAlso worth noting:\\n\\nIf you have painted plastic keys like me, the key pull tool that comes with the pack can potentially scratch your paint job due to lack of fexibility. So what I did was i cut the blue bar in the middle off, allowing the key puller more flexibility so when I go to pull my keys off I just need to apply pressure towards the bottom and nothing gets damaged.","[]","B01LZ4LNUF","B075RL6S3W","AGBI7FYZJ4XCS4W23NOVHHDZMYRQ","2017-01-10 22:59:18.000","9","True","508"

Let me give a written record as to the events that transpired after I made this purchase.\\n\\nWeek 1: The computer arrived a few days after it was ordered - that's reasonable. I took it out of the box, and it looked very nice. I set it up with all the necessary devices (monitor, keyboard, speaker, mouse, etc.) and turned it on. And nothing came up on the monitor - just a black screen. I could hear Cortana through the audio, so I knew that the computer was running. So I started investigating. After opening it up, experimenting with the computer and other devices, and taking it to a subject-matter specialist, we all came to the same conclusion: the video card was a dud.\\n\\nWeek 2-3: That frustrating enough as it is, but the rabbit hole is even deeper. I called up the Customer Support Line for CyberpowerPC, navigated through a phone menu, and found myself on the end of a voice-mailbox that stated, &#34;Please leave your name and a short description of your problem, and then hang up.&#34; I did what it wanted and waited. One week later, I had no response from anybody. So, I got in touch with Amazon to see if they could organize a replacement video card to be shipped. Unfortunately, since the video card is one of the more expensive components of the computer, Amazon was not in a position to set me up with a replacement part. They, however, gave me contact info for CyberpowerPC that I wasn't aware of. So, I gave this a try. I tried to send in a service form and give them a call...\\n\\nLong story short, CyberpowerPC has two different customer support lines - one of them is for purchases made through their own website, and the other is for purchases made through retailers like Newegg and Amazon. And guess which one I had to deal with. The one that was only a voice-mailbox set up probably to avoid having to deal with customers. CyberpowerPC has set up an organization structure revolving around avoiding contact with customers. And when the customer has questions or needs help, they are not going to get it from them. If you do decide to buy from CyberpowerPC, know that they will not help you if it does not work.","[]","B00IMOND82","B00IMOND82","AHVUHSFAWTJEPRQD2H3ASYD7KT5Q","2017-09-12 18:05:17.503","2","True","508"

"871552","2","Good sound, very poor craftsmanship -- cord casing cracking and disintegrating. These won't last!","I'd like to add my vote to the others: Good sound. Very poor craftsmanship.\\n\\nHad I posted a review when I first received these, it would have been five stars just for the sound! I am always willing to invest in pricey things that last, and I'm sure others are, too....hence my posting of this review to spread the info. As mentioned by others, the wax buildup happened fast, despite following their cleaning instructions with peroxide and alcohol. But that's something that can happen with any earbud, so not a huge deal. My main issue has to do with the extremely cheap casing on the cord, though there's been a few problems along the way:\\n\\n1. Very delicate connection construction. Who doesn't get the wire caught on something once in a while? Sometimes, despite careful wrapping and storage and clip usage and inside-shirt wearing, things get tugged on, because earbuds go through life's activities with you. These don't seem able to withstand anything at all. The wire loosened and separated from the earbuds very early after just a couple of months. The company was kind enough to replace them, but warned me that is was likely my incorrect storage causing this issue--definitely not the case, since I follow directions carefully. Also, when I received them back (or maybe a refurbished replacement pair, not sure), the mic button never worked well again. Either sticks or does not connect when I press it. Very hard to make calls and skip tracks.\\n\\n2. The cord. This is a major problem. When I pay $85 for a pair of earbuds, I expect them to last a little while. These lasted under a year before falling to pieces. I mean, actual pieces falling off. The housing on the cord is very, very cheap and thin, and the rubber itself started cracking. Then, when I wrapped them for storage, the cracks opened and the wires came out. Obviously, this had all sorts of horrible effects on the sound quality, plus I constantly received little pokes and zaps on my neck at the gym. I've included some photos of this from before I stopped using these months back....I'd highly recommend NOT purchasing these unless you plan to get a new pair for $85 every six months.

We've got high speed internet of a good, reliable quality and this device seems to be the only one that routinely drops off line. It is hard wired into power and only about 15 feet from the router. Would be really nice if the phone app had a way to plot online/offline time so you could see how often and how long the device was &#34;lost&#34;.\\n\\nCurrently working with Ring support who is responsive and helpful. If they can figure out what's going on, I'll update this post.\\n\\nUPDATE - Got this escalated to Level 2 and they punched a hole in the firewall to try to help the unit stay online. I also removed the device from my Apple iPhone as the master. It seemed to have more troubles than the wife's Android phone. But, now Ring can't seem to get the account straightened out. I constantly get messages that my account is not valid. Worked with Ring to try to resolve this, but it still isn't very consistent.\\n\\nThe product doesn't seem all that stable or reliable but the support team has been helpful. For this reason, they get a second star, but I wouldn't purchase another one.\\n\\nUPDATE 11/28/2017 - I must be one of the unlucky few. This thing doesn't work very well at all for us. Support has tried to help, but it doesn't seem to help. I get a lot of video of people's backsides as they walk away from the door. Sometimes it just freezes during video playback/capture. The most improvement we got was when I installed the Ring App on a computer that never leaves the house. This seems to mostly keep the doorbell connected to the network. When the App was installed on our two roving phones, it would disconnect pretty regularly.\\n\\nUPDATE 12/32/2017 - It got &#34;cold&#34; in the south (down into the teens and 20's) and this thing started reporting a low battery. It's hardwired into power!! Must be some kind of problem with the rechargeable battery pack or something.

I've had earbuds that cost over $100 (that kept out a LOT of the road noise and sounded great), but eventually they all break, so I'm never spending that much again.\\nI've had these a couple weeks and wore them for 11 hrs yesterday - this review is based on my experience with these earbuds.\\nThe wires have a silicone-rubber feeling.  They are about medium thickness.  They are slowly straightening out from being scrunched up in the package, but they tangle pretty often and are a bit of a pain to untangle.  Too soon to know how durable they are.  I expect that by the time I know that, they won't be available any more.  I haven't noticed any sound from the wires rubbing on my cloths or ea. other.\\nThey sound pretty good.  Not great, definitely not in ear monitors, but not bad either. For their price, that makes them a good value.\\nLike all earbuds, you need to get a good seal for hearing bass.\\nI only wore them with the tips they came with once - to make sure they work.  Since then I use Comply Iso earbud tips - size T-400 BTW.  They isolate noise and stay in my ears for all day rides.  Earbuds coming out of the ear is a royal PITA when riding with a helmet.\\nI have confirmed that the mic works.  I did one call where the other person had trouble hearing me - I suspect the mic was against my shirt at that time. Another person heard me just fine.  When I press the button on the mic, the music stops and my phone says it is &#34;listening&#34; (for a voice command).\\nI press it again and the music resumes.\\nUpdate  8-24-17  I wore these for almost 13 hours straight yesterday on a dusk to dawn motorcycle ride. They still work great (w/ Comply ISO tips).  I like being able to use the switch on the earbuds to mute the music.  I can do it with my summer gloves on.  The wires still tangle more than most other earbuds I have or have had.","[]","B06XPDRVC3","B06XPDRVC3","AF4XZUPPISFD2BXZYHTGGXZC47UA","2017-06-26 19:09:56.829","2","True","508"

I did a run wearing these and they were so comfortable and didn't jostle at all that I ended up wearing them for another 2 hours after my run, just enjoying the music streaming from my phone.  No aches in the ears, over the ears, or behind the head.\\nButtons/controls are easy to use and press.  It'd be great if the buttons weren't all on the same earpiece because I frequently accidentally press the upper AND lower buttons at the same time when I only mean to press one of them, since your thumb and fingers have to push back against the other side of the earpiece to get the button to click, and that's where the opposite button is, but no biggie.\\nSound is awesome.  There are 3 equalizer settings (regular, bass boost, treble boost) which I easily change mid-music to enhance whatever I'm listening to.\\nI was so in love with these that I raved about them for the past few weeks I've had them, bought another pair so I could keep one at home (for neighborhood jogs) and one in my gym bag, and all my raving got a bunch of friends to buy these headphones as well, and they all love them, too.\\nBattery charges in 1.5 - 2 hrs with the included USB charger cord (which you can plug into a standard USB to wall outlet conversion plug that comes with every cell phone these days, this conversion plug is not included with the headset), and I've been using them daily and have yet to need to recharge since my initial charge (but note I'm using 2 alternatingly).\\nI love that when I put them in my ears and turn them on, the headset announces, &#34;Power on.  Battery high,&#34; or &#34;medium,&#34; whatever battery power you have left, so you always know if you have to recharge before use.  I hate it when I'm in the middle of a run or a workout at the gym and my headset battery dies, causing the rest of my workout to be in silence with a useless headset around my neck.  With these battery announcements, if your battery dies on you mid-workout, then you were just a procrastinator. :)\\nBoth sets paired with my phone really easily on the first try.

"896422","4","Disappointed","After reading the positive reviews on Amazon I decided to buy this speaker. It is very good, a lot better than the other two I bought. However I still wish it would get louder than it does, but it does get very loud. But I just think volume could be improved a bit. There is no distortion and it also works very well to connect to your Bluetooth without you having to hit connect on your devices. That's not to say it always automatically connects, cuz it doesn't, but for the most part it does connect automatically. My main irritation with this speaker, is that it cuts off after a few minutes of no sound coming through it. So if you press pause on your music or video or whatever you're listening to or watching, and the speaker is idle for more than a few minutes, it cuts off and then you have to reconnect it. Manually. Sometimes you have to power down and power back up before it'll connect again! That is so annoying!! I can't tell you how frustrating that is!! I say to the manufacturer, please change that feature! Let the speaker stay on until we are ready for it again.  Let us be able to choose when we shut it down, let it stay working and connected even if we press pause and our music. The other two Bluetooth speakers that I had bought, do NOT have that problem, and they were a lot cheaper. I can leave that other speaker idle for HOURS, and as soon as I turn back on the music, it's automatically coming through the Bluetooth speaker without me having to do anything. I don't have to reconnect or anything, it's already ready to go it's always on standby ready to go. It never cuts itself off. The only time it disconnects, is when I shut it off. So I was really disappointed by that.  That is so aggravating! also having the volume button be the same as the skip or rewind button is extremely annoying also. It is so frustrating to try and raise the volume and then it skips your track to the next track! Or vice versa.  That was a really dumb feature and a stupid idea! I don't know what they were thinking when they put that in. Other than those two things it is a good speaker and I have no other complaints. Meanwhile I'll keep looking for another speaker that doesn't cut itself off when it feels like it, and that has a volume button that is separate from the track forward/back button.","[]","B01LZV6TYQ","B01LZV6TYQ","AFAKIPQM2VSXQH7G25NHMOYGWLTQ","2017-08-31 18:51:52.550","1","True","508"
"212624","1","Don't Waste Your Time","Don't. Waste. Your. Money. Like. I. Did. You know, the old adage is right - if you pay cheap for something, cheap is what you'll get. Let me count the ways.\\n1. The sub-woofer conks out, just stops working, after 20 minutes or so. The first time it did that i had to turn the unit off then turn it back on. The second time it conked out, I had to turn the unit off and wait a good 10 minutes before the woofer would come back. The third time it conked out I had to wait a good half hour before the subwoofer worked again. (By the way, this all happened on DAY ONE!)\\n2. One of the floor speakers had a rattled. At first I thought the base wasn't screwed in right. I re-screwed it, just like the others, and it kept rattling. The buzzing wasn't in the base but from the speaker itself, especially noticeable when the volume was up.\\n3. They have the cheapest, thinnest speaker wires known to man included in this set. How audio actually passed through them is a mystery, but the thinness meant a poor connection to the speakers. And speaking about the speakers...\\n4. The connector on one of the speakers broke off as I was placing the wire in. My friend fixed it, but these speakers have the cheapest connection I've ever seen. I was considering buying thicker, 16 gauge wire for this unit, but the fact that the subwoofer is so darn unstable made that a no-go. You shouldn't have to repair any electronic item you paid for. That's just ridiculous. The reason I gave the AAT3003 at least two stars is, when it did work, the speakers sounded okay. But, in the end, they are what they are - cheap speakers. I returned them and bought the Logitech 5.1 Z906.\\n\\nUpdate: I paid $90.45 to FedEx to return this piece of crap. At first, Onlyfactorydirect said they'd refund the shipping costs. Later, they changed their mind about it. In other words, $90.45 down the crapper. Stay away from Onlyfactorydirect and the Acoustic Audio AAT3003. I had to learn the hard way that there are still dishonest businessmen out there. Shameful.","[]","B06Y5Z9NKV","B06Y5Z9NKV","AFPUPFU2NB4XSBE4EAHYFE6OCRSQ","2017-06-13 05:48:07.413","14","True","508"
"125230","5","A happy customer-Instant gain of 2x of the wifi speed upon eero installation","Got the eero's this afternoon. It took me no time to set up. Unplugged my Apple Time Machine, plugged in one of the eeros, started up the eero app on my phone--viola! Everything started to work. I tested the wireless speed at various places in the house before and after eeros: In most of the areas the speed increased 2x, just like that! In a couple of &#34;dead&#34; zones, the speed went up 3x (to where the speed was right by the Time Machine). Like one reviewer said, the laws of physics still apply: In the farthest corner of the house (including one of the &#34;dead&#34; zones), the speed is only ½ of the speed in the other areas of the house, but totally usable now (unlike before eero). My Apple TV used to be connected by a cable (the wifi was too slow). I connected the Apple TV via the wireless just to see if that works--the connection was FAST.\\n\\nOne eero is in a room separated from the rest of the house by a set of heavy duty sliding glass doors. The other one is about 30+ feet away, equal distance from one end of the house to the other (where the other eero is). I am pretty certain 2 eeros are sufficient, but if not, I can add another one.\\n\\nIt took me a while to make up my mind to ditch the Apple router and extenders. I loved my Apple products, but the wifi just never fast enough even for basic web browser. I switched the network from hidden to not hidden, added extenders, tweaked the modem settings (to the extent I could find instructions), nothing helped. I paid extra for faster speed--didn't make a dent. Before buying the eeros, I agonized over what to do with my 3-year old Apple Time Machine. Well, once I saw how fast the wifi was with eeros, no more worries. I will still use the Time Machine for backup, but that's it.\\n\\nI am not sure what makes the wifi gain 2x the speed with eeros (am not referring to the &#34;mesh&#34; effect either), but the speed gain plus the mesh (aka blanketing) effect really makes a difference with tricky situations. So far I am very very happy.","[]","B01FXDV96M","B01FXDV96M","AEQMJRH6BGQ23IMHI5OBDHWNZ5SA","2017-02-16 00:46:27.000","2","True","508"

With an emphasis on producing a very lightweight and compact keyboard for Apple hardware, Adesso probably fulfilled both objectives but somewhere along the development, they disregarded the human interaction. Do not get me wrong – it’s a very capable keyboard but its compact form was too compact for my tolerances and perhaps half the world population might benefit from my experience.\\n\\nThe Adesso Bluetooth Mini Keyboard for iPad and Mac is laptop sized keyboard intended for the iPad but can be used with any device that uses the Human Interface/Input Device (HID) profile for Bluetooth devices. With a compact 84-key keyboard layout intended for Apple products, there are enough dual-use and discrete keys provide inadvertent versatility with PCs.  Finally, powering the entire work are two AAA batteries – you can fully ‘recharge’ this keyboard as fast as you can change batteries.\\n\\nHaving recently transitioned to Mac after using the same PC computer for 14 years, I was looking for accessories for my Mac Mini.  With the market of 3rd party manufactures almost nil, I was pleasantly surprised that Adesso was one of the few that make Mac compatible hardware.  Having a very positive experience a [[ASIN:B002KCD3AA mini keyboard for PC]], I was looking forward to this being a substitute for the magic keyboard 2 but the firsthand experience as very subpar. With a keyboarding surface a little over 9 in. the keys have a very small surface.  Combined with how tightly packed the key are, I was accidently pressing other keys.  I would I like to think of myself as a very adaptable person but ultimately figured this keyboard was not meant for men like myself who have size large hands.\\n\\nWith that I mind, its still a great keyboard for people who have size medium and smaller hands – which I figure is more common in women and comparable adults.  Disregarding size, this keyboard is still the best combination of style and technical features for the person looking to go beyond the software keyboard of an iPad yet not compromising with portability but don’t just limit yourself there – it will also work with iPhones, Mac and PC computers, Amazon Fire Kindles, and any other Bluetooth enabled device ensuring you can your keyboard familiarity to any device that needs it.","[]","B007OX272A","B007OX272A","AEEEERNXNBFOYP5UC2LD4CGKYHYQ","2017-01-23 22:15:03.000","0","True","508"
"620612","5","Sainsweet 16 channel Relay Module concepts","The Sainsmart 16 Relay board is an inexpensive bargain.  The primary purpose is to isolate the computer from the outputs.  RFI or spikes can travel down a wire into a computer and mess up the logic causing any output to go on randomly.  This board provides isolation in the relays, the standard usually being 1500 volts and opto isolation on the inputs using an optoisolator diode and optical transistor driving an amplifier.\\nThe board is wired when the ground is connected between the computer and the relay board. This is the only power connection needed along with the 16 discreet inputs which operate the relay with a ground input to one of the 16 pins on the header of the board.\\nThe 5volt pins 19 and 20 are sufficient to provide power for the computer but the real purpose is to provide input power to run the opto-isolators.  Apparently this board has been provided with either 5volt or 12 volt relays.  You should check the relay marking before connecting power on the power input pins.  The Relays are SPST non-connected contact types, so you may wire virtually any load, but beware that the PC board and the associated connectors will probably not really handle much more than an amp at up to 120vac or 36vdc even though the relay is rated at a higher loads for its contacts.  A good input source is Elegoo Mega pins 22 to 55 or a string of 74HC595 serial shift registers.  If you connect two relay boards, you will probably need to breakout the wires to prevent connecting a solid 5vdc source to an input pin on the Mega.  Note that the Mega has a female socket and the relay board has a male socket.  Twenty wire Multicolor flat cable with connectors is a good choice for wiring.\\nAlso note that the inputs support open collector inputs which permit wired &#34;OR&#34; wiring.  Personally, I would not use the 5vdc pins for anything other than the relay board.  For safety operation I would provide +12Vdc at about 0.8Amps or more.  I use this board to power 16 slow motion Tortoise switch machines on my Model Railroad using a +12vdc and a +24vdc power source.  You really don't need a schematic since the relay board is so redundant in its wiring.  The 5 volt converter is a LM2576 12v to 5v 3 amp converter.","[]","B0057OC66U","B0B2D1NZXL","AHUBELWZNGLK73IUNGPJ5CT3PGOQ","2017-02-13 03:41:56.000","1","True","508"

My main issue with it is this:  mine does not work when the unit is wired &#34;in series.&#34;  (I have Verizon FIOS Digital Voice)  I have to wire it in parallel.  The problem with this is that the phone rings once whenever a blocked number calls...  Yes it is an annoyance to hear the phone ring once (and then cut out).  If the phone rings more than once, I have to get up and run to the phone base to see what the number is and if I want to block it.  (or, I sometimes wait till later and pull up the &#34;call list&#34; from the blocker, review the recent numbers that called, and block from there...)  I really wish that the phone handset would show the calling number when the system is wired &#34;in parallel.&#34;\\n\\nThis system needs to be improved.  This unit should be able to recognize &#34;auto-dialers&#34; and automatically cut off the call before it rings even once!!  I don't know if that is technically possible.  At a minimum, it should recognize BLOCKED numbers and cut off the call before the phone rings at all.  Again I don't know if that is technically possible.  But the unit as it currently operates is certainly not ideal.\\n\\nIt works well enough that I'm glad I have it.  I get some satisfaction out of hitting that big red button when an unknown number comes up.  It should not be so expensive though.  $99 is too much.  $50 would be much more acceptable.  But I'm sure the company that sells this unit knows just how much average people hate telemarketing calls, and that people will go to great lengths to get rid of these types of calls.\\n\\n12/6/17 update:  I am fairly happy with the product.  One thing I just discovered that needs to be improved though...  If you block a number by accident, and then go into the &#34;blocked numbers&#34; list to delete it - it is NOT the first number that comes up.  I just did that and had to scroll waaaaaaaaaaaay down the list to find the number that I had just blocked 30 seconds earlier.","[]","B0191XMBV2","B079BZQ987","AFMTOWY6J6YY57ZYPCPODD2725ZA","2017-09-30 00:03:00.928","9","True","508"
"438507","4","128GB Dual USB A/C Storage With Speed USB-C Tests.","I bought the 128GB module for use on a 2016 Macbook Pro. All my tests were done with a USB-C Gen 2 10GB/s port. I've been using the device every day for about two weeks now.\\n\\nTesting Environment:\\n- 2016 Macbook Pro 2.9Ghz\\n- OS X 10.12.4\\n- BlackMagicDesign Disk Speed Test 3.0\\n- Tests: 5GB, 3GB, 1GB\\n\\nTest Analysis:\\nRead speeds were pretty consistent across file size. Write speeds were slightly better with larger files which is to be expected. Though read speeds were only impacted minimally as the device heated up with sustained and continuous read/writes the same is not true with write speeds. With the device cool initial speeds start at about 20MB/s dropping to 2MB/s as the device got warm. The device does not get hot but it does get warm and it has an impact on write speeds.\\n\\nWrite: 2-30MB/s\\nRead: 100-130MB/s\\n\\nThoughts:\\nThe device is not intended to be a hard drive and isn't expected to have long sustained writes, but overall the write speeds are a tad disappointing. I am using the device for storage of art and document files that do not have a lot of read/write time so the speeds are really good. My intention was to be able to store files on something small that I would not need additional adapters and for that the device is amazing. It's read speeds are very good. The plastic cap would be better if it were designed to cover either the USB-A or USB-C port depending on which is in use. As it is, it only covers the USB-C end.\\n\\nSummary:\\nI would consider buying another one if I found I needed it. The slight drawbacks it has are minimal in most cases. The all metal design is a big plus. I understand you cannot defy the laws of physics but if Kingston can reduce the heat generated or reduce the effect the heat has on the write speed this will be an even better device. If you are looking for something to use with both traditional usb as well as USB-C you could do much worse, and as of this writing you wont find anything better for the price.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mRJWTUCFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mRJWTUCFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mRJWTUCFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61oaELrRH-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61oaELrRH-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61oaELrRH-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sQG4-6v0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sQG4-6v0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sQG4-6v0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01M59PHE4","B01179M6DQ","AHHAD5LV4R4BD5JPEVL6KN6JZJDQ","2017-04-17 05:39:21.000","4","True","508"
"390518","5","This is THE case!","This case is next to perfect. I searched for hours before I finally ordered a case for my iPad 2017. I was extremely picky. I wanted a keyboard that would allow me to use my iPad like a computer, but still, allow me to use it like an iPad. I wanted it to be sturdy and protective.\\n\\nThe best features include:\\n*360 turning\\n*iPad can lay down flat either screen down or screen up over keyboard\\n*iPad can be detached from keyboard and still has a protective shell (although I don't - it is easier to just hold the keyboard for me)\\n*I can type naturally on the keyboard. None of the buttons are awkward\\n*I feel like I have a computer until I want a tablet and then I have a tablet. I switch back and forth all the time and it isn't weird or awkward or even hard.\\n*There is a metal piece that can be used to balance the iPad if you are typing. It can also be used as a handle when the iPad is closed.\\n* the case closes together!! It closes if the screen is down facing the keyboard but it also hooks the iPad and keyboard together if the screen is up. This makes it easy to hold the table while still being attached to the keyboard.\\n*Auto wake/sleep function for the iPad screen is great.\\n*Keyboard will sleep when not in use to conserve power. To reuse just type a button and it will auto sync back to the iPad.\\n*Connecting the two was extremely easy. Once paired I have never had to manually repair.\\n\\nWith all the advantages of the case, there are only two disadvantages\\n*Sometimes there is lag on the keyboard. I just keep typing and it keeps up. Occasionally it has added periods which is weird. I haven't found it to be anything major and it only happens occasionally and when I type for small periods of time or at the beginning of typing.\\n*There is no good way to attach a stylus. Really this would just be a nice bonus. Right now I have a makeshift stylus holder wrapped around the entire case, but when I open the case I have to take it off. I will figure out something else evaluatively. This would be a nice edition in a future model, but it really would just make an amazing case absolutely epic.","[]","B012BTCZ9G","B012BTCZ9G","AFJTAJV3O6WGU4QZSLXQQTYVRYXA","2017-05-11 21:36:42.000","2","True","508"

MFG DATE: 9-15-2016  CPU: APQ 8009 [Qualcomm Snapdragon 212 which is an updated version of the SG 210, according to the Qualcomm website. [That's good]  Arrived in excellent condition with 7000mAh battery half charged.  Followed instructions to bring over files and apps. from my other tablet, worked like a charm.  It's Android 6.0.1 according to &#34;About&#34; the tablet in the settings.  Had 3 software build updates, installed one at a time, with success.  It takes a while so let it do it's thing and follow the directions as it gives them to you. Dolby Atmos sound is good, loud enough for us.  Ran all my apps (50+) fine.  Watched golf on streaming app(NBC Sports) works good.  No glitches.  My main usage is various apps.,reading (Kindle and Nook), email, research on the net, sports videos, some camera use.  I am not a gamer,  The integrated Adreno 304 graphics card is clocked at 400 MHz, considered entry level. [ In 1988, we opened for business in Hong Kong and, in 1996, became China’s largest PC company. We were renamed Lenovo in 2004 and the following year, we acquired the Personal Computer Division from IBM. FYI]  I've been in the electronics and computer industry for a very long time as for background including engineering and management.  So far, so good.  I'm very pleased. This is a much more stable environment, hardware & software, than an &#34;off&#34; brand I was using for the past two years.  Should have stayed with a known brand like Lenovo or others.  Hope this write-up helps.  Price is certainly excellent for this purchase.  Happy computing.\\n3/16/2017 Update:  TB-X103F_S000026_170217_ROW new Build Number Software Update(430mb) makes this device respond very quickly. It is very obvious that the update has really improved the performance.  Again, it takes time for the update so don't touch it, unless it tells you to, and it will do it's job.  Nice job Lenovo software engineering team.","[]","B01NAIQNHQ","B01NAIQNHQ","AHDYLEI6BXE7K7KCDFIITPUDP37Q","2017-03-06 18:41:23.000","183","True","508"
"565918","2","Be kind to yourself and don't get this product. 2 stars is a generous review, really.","This is both a review and complaint. I've heard great things about TT and see their products a lot more now. I'm an RGB fan so when I saw this product line released, I was ecstatic. RGB PSUs? I'll give you my money.\\n\\nSo I buy this product thinking it'll be fantastic but to my disappointment, it's not RGB or at least if it is, I can't get it to work. There's a button in the back that should enable different colors and theoretically speaking, RGB, but it doesn't work outside of switching to other static colors. There's no software that comes with it so you can't control the RGB lighting. You can scour the web and find DPS RGB App which is supposed to work with these products but they won't work, saying it can't find a USB connection. It's a PSU, what USB connection?! You can get everything you want, MSI Gaming App, Corsair Link, you won't get the RGB to work for you. It sucks, it's infuriating, and it's annoying.\\n\\n2 stars is a generous review in my opinion. I've tried calling TT customer support, no response. I've tried sending an email to TT customer support, no response. At this point I only have a few days until I can no longer return it to Amazon and TT won't contact me back. I'll use this as an expensive PSU I suppose and I don't feel like taking the PSU and cables apart just because TT's product and software failed on me.\\n\\nEdit 1: Not sure about the RGB on this product but I found out what the &#34;USB&#34; thing is about. On the Gold model it will NOT have a USB slot among the other cable connection slots. &#34;What do you mean by this?&#34; Go check out the &#34;Digital Gold&#34; model and compare it with the &#34;Gold&#34; version, and you'll know what I mean. I'm not sure if there's a way to get RGB going for this product but if you have the &#34;Digital Gold&#34; version it will come with a USB slot with a cable running from it -&#62; connect it to a USB slot on your motherboard -&#62; run DPS RGB App 2.0 -&#62; get RGB.","[]","B01N4C39AR","B0C32YYCRB","AGXTRUN6Y6DIRWZWG5BNPXJFOB5A","2017-06-23 14:12:54.879","5","True","508"
"772042","5","Fast and Reliable","I purchased my first pair a year ago. I'm very happy with their performance and reliability. They never give me any troubles. The connection speed is supper fast. In my configuration, I can top the speed at 900+Mbps in iperf3 tests.\\n\\nI heard there was a connectivity issue in its firmware. When the first pair arrived, I flushed their firmware to 2.11.1.10.6200.1 immediately. I never observe the issue with this firmware version.\\n\\nTo cover all rooms of my house, I just purchased the 2nd pair. The adapters arrived with a newer firmware 2.11.1.50.6200.7. They work great together with the old adapters.  But I thought it is a good idea to make all my 4 in sync, so that I sent a customer service request to Actiontec via email. They responded quickly with a new firmware 2.11.1.50.6200.727 and installation instructions embedded.\\n\\nThen I made a mistake: since the firmware Actiontec sent to me has a higher number, I flushed all my 4 ECB6200s.  It turns out that actually the new pair has a different hardware version. The old adapters work well with the latest firmware, but the new adapters were very unstable.\\n\\nThen I contacted Actiontec again. They were very responsive. They realized the issue immediately and sent me 2.11.1.50.6200.7. Fortunately the pair was not bricked. After applying this version, they just came back to normal.\\n\\n1. There are at least 2 different types of ECB6200. One is with solid cover on its back, has hardware version 2A. The other has vent cover, version is 2C.\\n2. Hardware 2A's latest firmware is 2.11.1.50.6200.727; Hardware 2C's latest firmware is 2.11.1.50.6200.7\\n3. You can submit service request to get the latest firmware.\\n4. Actiontec's customer service is responsive and professional.\\n\\nOverall I'm satisfied with my ECB6200s. The only drawback, or say minor issue, is that its latency is slightly higher than Ethernet cable: 3~5ms vs almost 0ms in PING. I think it is acceptable.","[]","B013J7O3X0","B0B7JYBD4L","AHMIDADRROSOXDOUPTIMPQRJ33FQ","2017-01-31 15:01:28.000","44","True","508"
"192440","4","Great Value, Love the bass but voice quality in music falls short a bit.","I received these headphones today and I am very happy with them so far. I have some beats solos which I love but have found them to be hot around my head during the summer months. So I wanted an in ear alternative and I wasn't about to pay the ridiculous price being charged by beats for their in ear option. So I came here to amazon and found these Senso headphones at a great price. I have to say most of the reviews are pretty spot on.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Light weight.\\n- Easy to set up\\n- Tangle free cord\\n- Voice caller id - My wife was calling me and the headset read out here number to me. So you don't even have to look at your phone to see who is calling assuming you actually know your friends and families number by heart.\\n- Great multifunction charging cord that can be used to charge my iphone 6 and the headsets.\\n- Good noise cancellation\\n- Conversations work well in nosey situations. I was shooting basketball in my driveway and the wind was blowing. But my wife could hear me perfectly in fact better than my beats solo.\\n- Charges quickly\\n- The carrying case is nice and compact and great for carrying\\n- Wire tie is a great addition to keep the wires from dangling all over the place\\n\\nCons\\n- It has a lot of bass which is usually a good thing for me. But the voices or treble sounds washed out. I thought it was just audiophiles being over sensitive but even I noticed it and it was a bit of a let down.\\n- The over the ear hooks are very soft. That's a good and bad thing. You can't adjust the shape which would be nice. But it's not a deal breaker.\\n- Can't figure out a way to initiate siri with this headset. It would be awesome if there was some hard press or other way to get that to work.\\n\\nOverall I am happy with my purchase if they could fix the sound quality so that voices in my music sound match up better with all the bass this produces, it would be damn near perfect. And if they can figure out a way to initiate siri then addressing those two short comings would make this a 5 star product. But for the price it's still worth it.

"617983","3","Some software bugs that need to be ironed out - Once they do, this is a great product","UPDATE: I was contacted by a higher tier support, and was very impressed with how they handled everything. Turns out there is a bug that causes different behavior depending on how you are recording. As far as I know they are working on a fix right now, which makes me bump this review up to 3 starts. Once they work out some of their bugs, I would happily rate this camera as 5 stars.\\n\\nFirst I'll start with the good. The picture quality is great. It has a magnetic base which makes mounting very easy. It's highly configurable. Unfortunately, there are 2 main issues that made me return this product.\\n\\n1) Recorded video is extremely choppy. It seems to be a common problem with this camera. When it's recording it will sometimes skip 10-15 seconds, which frankly is just unacceptable for a security camera. I know when the company replies to my review it will say it's because of network latency, but it's not. Something's up with the hardware.\\n\\n2) This  was actually the main reason I returned this camera. It's a setting called &#34;record delay&#34; It determines how long the camera should wait from when it sense motion to when it starts to record. IT HAS TO HAVE A VALUE OF AT LEAST 10 SECONDS. I don't know why anybody would want to wait 10 seconds before the camera starts recording. This feature alone renders this camera completely useless. I had this located on my front porch, and someone can easily walk up to my front door, grab a package and be on their way in less than 10 seconds. Best I can hope for from this camera is maybe a shot of the back of their head, which doesn't help me at all. It actually blows my mind that someone at Amcrest thought this feature was a good idea. The funny part is I actually contacted the support team and asked them what the heck is the purpose of this feature and if there was any way to disable it. There response was you can't disable it, and then they sent my screenshots on were I could locate this feature in their Admin UI. Haha, I know how to locate this feature, it's the entire reason I'm returning your product.\\n\\nAnyways, for those two reasons, this camera is pretty much useless if you plan on using this camera truly for security, and need reliable motion activated recording.","[]","B01M0SN42N","B01M0SN42N","AGS2KQVZO262Z2KN2NSVW2M267DQ","2017-04-05 04:17:40.000","3","True","508"

"108541","1","Cleanliness May Be Next to Godliness, BUT Beware of he Unholy Problems it Can Cause!","I gave SuperSonic a 1-star rating because of an actual problem with the TV and because SuperSonic is very greedy when it comes to fulfilling their responsibilities under their manufacturers new equipment warranty. The problem with the TV is a thin electronic, vertical line that divides the LED screen.  At this time, Its an annoyance and won't cause me any problem for now.  However, over time, I assume the line will grow and eventually destroy the LED screen.  I can here all of you yelling at me -  Why didn't you just return the TV to Amazon.  Believe me I would love to return the TV to Amazon, but in a rare moment of trash awareness, I decided to purge the house of all trash because the trash man comes early Friday morning I knew i wouldn't complete the installation of the wall mount and TV until the following day.  Well Friday came around the trash man arrived and picked up all the trash including all of the new packaging for the SuperSonic TV. Shortly after the pick-up, I discovered the problem with the TV;  Amazon policy is clear, they won't take it back items without original packaging.  So I knew that SuperSonic would warrant their products against defects in manufacturing. I sat down to read the manufacturers new equipment warranty..  WHAT A JOKE!  Supersonic expected me to pay freight both ways, make certain I packaged up all parts and sent it back not just the defective part.  Then depending upon the mood of the warranty department the manufacturer would either deny the claim, repair the TV or replace the TV.  All of this activity would be accomplished in a 60-day period after receiving the TV.  I've been in he sales and service industries for years, but I have never come across such a one sided new equipment warranty as the one SuperSonic extended to me.  I think it is important to stress that I didn't expect Supersonic to do anything more than repair or replace my TV in a reasonable period of time - say 10-days after receipt at their warranty station.  I don't now why I should be responsible for paying return freight for a customer service problem created by their faulty manufacture.  Finally, why do they need the entire TV sent in.  Do they scavenge parts for other purchasers so they can repair their TV's?  Next time I need another LED TV I will vote with my $$$ and I won't be voting for SuperSonic!","[]","B007GFD3EW","B07DLGVJMQ","AHPSCAWQNDLTGXDFPAURZWW7XBHA","2017-08-25 21:51:34.665","6","True","508"
"185720","5","This Antenna Works Better Than Expected. Can't Recommend it Enough","We are so happy to have FREE HD-TV. No more paying for cable or satellite tv. We used TVFool and other websites to check out signal strength and directions, and they did not bode well, but we took a chance.  Now we get signals that these websites say we shouldn't!  Although this is supposed to be good outdoors, we put this antenna in the attic. Even though it says it's omnidirectional, we do detect differences depending on placement. Maybe it's direction, maybe it's interference -- but in any event, we tried it in a few different positions before we settled on the current placement. We ran the cable from the attic down into the house and then into the TV. We live in the hills, and there are trees around us.  In addition to our local stations, we often get stations from a city more than 300 miles away! I guess it depends on the weather for those. We don't rely on them - they're like bonus stations.  I would like to know more about what affects the farther away stations -- people using their microwaves? wind? solar flares? If anyone knows a good website for me to learn more, please pass it along! At the end of the day -- this little antenna in the attic is bringing in more channels than the channel websites think we should be getting, and we don't have to pay for cable anymore. Between this and internet, we can't imagine going back to paying for TV. The whole thing was easy to set up, and even if it was outside, it's not an eye-sore. Tip: Be patient in asking your TV to find the channels. Re-position, and cycle through again. Keep going until you've got the best position and set-up. Then don't touch it! Have fun with free tv. We really are happy. If I bought another antenna, it would be one like this with even more range, and it would go on the outside.  ***Update:  We tried four more antennas just to see if we could get MORE channels -- tried Mohu Sky 60, GE and RCA Yagi-type antennas, and a big Channel Master antenna.  None of them found as many channels as this Lava Omnipro.  The Mohu Sky actually couldn't find our most local channels.  So, we are re-confirmed that this Lava Omnipro was best choice for us in our location.*** July2018","[]","B00EPP5ZSS","B096RVHR59","AHNA43ZFGVDOLHXSGH3525SVZ2WQ","2017-09-06 19:22:33.853","46","True","508"
"853469","2","I Got What I Paid For","I have had this device for over a year now, and it worked pretty well at the start. It is incredibly easy to set up, and had decent range, but it is almost too simple in that there are virtually no setting on it to adjust when you do have a problem. To further complicate issues, the &#34;Support&#34; section of the app for it does not seem to ever be updated, and contains instructions that are completely inaccurate (for example: instructions about using KSLINK X, a feature that was removed in the last update, something Inonly found out about by writing to their help desk because the connection I had a number of devices set up to use suddenly ceased to exist)\\n\\n  For most of the first year, I had to regularly reset the kisslink (about once or twice a week), as itt would simply stop working, but since the last update This has increased to basically every time I connect to device, and then maybe even multiple times within a few minutes of each other. Moving the kisslink closer to my main router has not done anything to improve the situation.\\n\\n  Before the last update, I would have given this four stars, as it had basically worked, it is reasonably priced, and it is super-simple to set up, but now it has been rendered almost useless, and I will have to spend more money to buy something that actually does what I bought this to do.\\n\\nPros: Small; can be placed somewhere unobtrusive so that it cannot be seen, and even the LEDs can be turned off to make it even less noticeable. Simple: Easy to set up, plug it in, connect to it, set up your wifi information, download the app to your phone, and you are ready to go... in theory.\\nCons: Too simple: when it stops working, there is no way to really figure out why, and nothing to adjust in the setting to try and fix it. The reset option is not the on the first screen of the app: it's only a couple of menus to navigate through to get to it, but you're going to Ben using it a lot, and it would be more convenient to be on the main screen. Latest update has rendered it largely useless: I would not recommend buying this the way it is now unless you really like devices that do not work properly. Spend a little extra and buy something that works.","[]","B00V442E32","B0778R1F52","AEZTXVASD233W6LI3E4DFMPUTUZA","2017-10-10 05:50:11.913","0","False","508"
"146410","4","First I love gaming on this monitor and for the price I ...","First I love gaming on this monitor and for the price I paid (xmas/black friday price of around 1K) I think it is worth it.  However, understand it's got\\n some drawbacks.  I think Samsung has nailed the width issue for this type monitor (ie ultrawide craze which I think will be the standard in about 3 years).  As crazy as it sounds though, coming from a two 30inch monitor setup this is the correct width but I don't think a curved ultrawide @35inch or @34inch is big enough or correct trade-off for a single monitor replacement setup.  This monitor is an absolute joy at 144 hz and not bad for productivity either.  I will admit the dpi is low and up close it is noticeable, however, for a slightly farther viewing distance this is, for the most part, negated (ie using vesa wall mount for an extra 3-6 inch further back from the back of a standard desk or credenza). The depth of my desk is 29inches.  I find an extra 6 is preferable.  I have 2 other monitor types in the house (a 27 inch dell and two 30 inch dell).  The actual viewable vertical (meaning the actual screen not bezels)  real estate to each type of my other monitors is 14.5 inches vertically on my 27' dell and 16inches vertically on my two dell 30 inch. The actual viewable vertical real estate on this one is only 13.25inches.  This comes to my one complaint about this monitor-vertical real estate.  My other dells run a resolution of 1600 vertically while this one is only 1080.  For Samsung, Asus, Acer etc... to truly have the one &#34;ring&#34; to rule them all (Tolkien reference).  The vertical resolution and actual screen size will need to come up at minimum of 1440 and 1.5 to 3 inches vertically for each respective specification along with the width of this monitor.  After trying a Acer 35 predator ultrawide a friend has and this monitor my conclusion each needs what the other has.  The acer needs the Samsung Chg90 width and the Samsung needs the 35 predators height.  My hope is that Samsung gets more feedback and the engineers can truly produce the a just about perfect monitor for GAMING & PRODUCTIVITY.  Maybe a Chg100/101 etc...","[]","B072C7TNC5","B0BPL23TRN","AHP3FHYVYYUC7BEKE4WV4R4DWC7Q","2017-12-13 15:53:02.769","13","True","508"
"943058","5","Travel add on, field organizer (military or LEO), or office heroes, this is a must for on the go","There are few products I will review, but this is one I think many travelers, students, military personnel and office heroes can benefit from. I spent the better part of an afternoon chasing down Amazon reviews on tech organizers for traveling. At one point I had five highlighted, but the BAGSMART Travel Universal Cable Organizer is ultimately the one I selected. I like it for it's simplicity but the functionality is why I purchased it. In the military I constantly looked for ways to pack out the most gear into the field with the least amount of space needed. I continue that in our travels and wanted something that would eliminate multiple bags (camera, cord, tech extras such as SD cards) and allow me to access them without the bag dump. This one pouch eliminates a camera bag, an Eagle Creek bag (small I used for cords), an SD card pouch, multiple twist / zip ties for cords, earbud case and much more. The pouch seamlessly fits into any messager bag or  backpack and can be readily identified as your electronic storage. Make sure whatever organizer you purchase, check its dimensions. This is roughly the same size as my Kindle Fire. Some organizers were larger than my lunch box, eliminating the space saver concept I was looking for.\\n\\nI wanted a bag that can be retrieved without grabbing ten other items when facing security scans at Beijing (PEK) where electronics are notoriously searched. Now all I need is this pouch, my Kindle Fire and cellphone and all electronics can easily be presented at PEK and other locations where your bags may otherwise be dumped for electronic scans. Here's what I included into my case:\\n\\nInternational adapter Europe\\nInternational adapter Asia\\niPhone earbuds\\nInsignia external battery pack and charger cord\\niPhone charger\\nKindle Fire charger\\nextra Apple adapter cord\\nSamsung DSLR and charger\\nFitbit charger\\n\\nThere's still room for SD and SIM card and one or two cords, but this fits all my necessities. While the colors aren't what I had hoped, the blue is distinguishable from my packing cubes and other items. I would like to see a neon green, orange or yellow, something that catches the eye as electronics. Aside from a personal preference on color scheme, it's a great add on to my carry-on travels. Next trip Chengdu, will update on its performance.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71E+mr3ShVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71E+mr3ShVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71E+mr3ShVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WAE23-8OL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WAE23-8OL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WAE23-8OL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817QqZmMOKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817QqZmMOKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817QqZmMOKL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B017SKRZIO","B01LAWOYE4","AFJIPYYXJNK7ZGKH2EVEZCMVKIBQ","2017-01-22 21:53:10.000","233","True","508"
"325303","2","I read reviews before purchasing this monitor","I read reviews before purchasing this monitor, both the negative and the positive. I saw the positive reviews greatly outnumbered the negative, and dismissed them as a minority finding things to complain about. I was wrong to dismiss them.\\n\\nPROS:\\n\\nThe monitor (not the screen) looks and feels high quality. Comes with HDMI, DisplayPort, and a downstream USB which made it easy to connect my web cam. The screen handlez 144hz easy, and came with some nice bonus software allowing you to configure some of the display settings without fiddling with buttons.\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\nWAY TOO BRIGHT! Even at 0 brightness and changing the gamma settings, there is no mercy for your eyes. I had to change my background to a dull color just to even be capable of looking at it. I need to mentally prepare myself before opening Chrome. I work in IT and have tons of daily exposure to tons of different monitors, but have never experienced this level of assault before.\\n\\nThe monitor does not sync with the settings upon waking up. For example, you set your brightness to 0, your computer goes to sleep and wakes up, the monitor will blast you with light like brightness 50, but the settings still say 0. You have to make any change at all for the monitor to sync to the settings again, like switching to brightness 1 and then 0 again. Not sure what this is about but my old monitor certainly did not have this problem.\\n\\nThe colors look incredibly washed out, and there's no fixing it. What used to be a solid blue looks like faded jeans now. I have made tons of adjustments on the monitor and even my AMD software and nothing helps. This is probably the most disappointing part for me because now I can't enjoy my high refresh rate since everything just looks bad.\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\n\\nI can't recommend this monitor. I have had nothing but problems that I didn't realize could even be possible for a modern LED monitor. I'm seriously considering switching back to my old Lenovo monitor because 144hz just isn't worth all this. I have used LED screens before, and they have been vibrant and highly adjustable. For some reason, this monitor just does not perform. On the plus side, I have been more motivated to take breaks because I am now physically in pain from prolonged use.","[]","B01BV1XBEI","B07S5G2B6Y","AG62PBIZ5OKDJ6PPBOHLBCKS3DRA","2017-05-03 13:57:32.000","2","True","508"
"29484","5","Fine video and sound quality, straightforward and solid unit","We do a number of different and visually-demanding tasks on our computer, including picture editing on Photoshop Elements and PC games on Steam, so this monitor has proven to be of high visual quality (using it with a newish Digital Storm PC and a good Nvidia card). The 27&#34; screen has a very small margin around the edge, and is otherwise a good width for desktop use. At 1920x1080 the display is of very high video sharpness.\\n\\nI haven't noticed any yellows or other chromatic problems that other reviewers have noted (I do have a color-calibration tool, but haven't needed it), and among the five control buttons on the lower-right edge of the monitor includes a Preset Mode that has a number of video settings that can adjust the view in a number of ways, including custom RGB settings, so if you don't like the tones you can change them. The four adjustment buttons all trigger a small set of control icons just above them that are intuitive and efficient (on/off button is the fifth button, far right corner).\\n\\nThe built-in speakers rest in the metal video base and are of far better quality than the analog computer speakers they've replaced. The speakers are side by side, but close enough to the user that the stereo effect is still pronounced. It has two volume buttons (+/-) on the right side for easy adjustment. The speaker housing rests fairly loosely in the base, and has a cord just long enough to reach its special port under the monitor (and a nice clip to hold the cord in place).\\n\\nMinor quibbles: the monitor has only 1 HDMI and 1 VGA-type port, plus two mini-stereo ports and a special port for the speaker. I find no USB ports, so you'll need the PC tower for that. The monitor itself only tilts forward and back 0 to 15 degrees back on the vertical; no horizontal pivot (unless you turn the whole assembly physically) and does not slide up and down. The pedestal base seems solid, otherwise, all-metal and seating the speaker. The assembly does mean a modest footprint on your desk and few cables to tangle, so it's a simple ensemble, and I had no problems with setup and initial use. The drivers-and-documentation CD seems to cover all needs.\\n\\nIn all, a solid performer; highly recommend.","[]","B06XYPPCZX","B06XYPPCZX","AESFT2GVJAZWETXV3BCOF32A6JRA","2017-05-28 21:58:48.000","3","False","508"
"39773","1","Worst review I've ever had to write","I usually try to put on the proverbial other shoe and try to find something positive to offer. This is the first time where I can truly say the only positive is that Amazon’s shipping and return processes are fast an easy. Now for the unpleasant experience of writing a review for this Protronix E35-B.\\n\\nThe enclosure itself is pretty nice to look at and I would’ve been proud to leave it out in the open. Installation of my new 4TB hard drive was easily performed with the included screwdriver. The other reviews about the mounting tracks allowing for a pretty excessive amount of moment were spot on but this didn’t bother me as I planned to nestle it securely behind my dual displays. This action would also solve the laser point level of brightness coming off the status LED.\\n\\nThe function of this device is where things starting going downhill. In my case there was none. After plugging the USB cord into a USB v3 port I received the telltale sound of a connection but received no autoplay options. I started with the integrated disk manager thinking it was just a partitioning issue but found nothing. Checking out the device manager confirmed that the OS did not know what to do with this detected device. Trying 3 separate ports did nothing to improve this condition. Searched for drivers (sometimes you get lucky) which did not result in anything.\\n\\nAt this point I’m not all that worried. I have about 30+ years of experience working on PCs so it’s just another fun round of troubleshooting. Let’s hit up the website to look for some drivers. I found a link on the included single page of instructions (front side only) and entered it in my browser. Hmmm…. DNS error. No worries, I’ll go to root of the site. Ahh…. a picture that resembles the device I’m troubleshooting. I hit the support link and am presented with “Lorem epsem dorem”…. Wait What?! For those of you who have not built a website from a template this means the support page is literally a web page template that someone put live before actually filling out the page. It literally has no useful information on it at all.\\n\\nMy next step. Return to Amazon. Thankfully that part was quick and easy. Now I’ll be searching for a replacement for this device.","[]","B00T6L2M4Q","B00T6L2M4Q","AGTGGKIOMK2CA2BUQIRUDNTC7LPQ","2017-02-11 17:39:40.000","3","True","508"
"727972","3","Product works fine. Quality for the price was decent and the ...","Product works fine.\\n\\nQuality for the price was decent and the plastic material is still light weight even though it requires a AAA battery. It does come with a whale shaped stand, which seems silly to me since it can still tip over. Why not a carrying case? Turning wheel and clickers are all flexible and none are hard to manipulate with your thumb or index finger.\\n\\nPositives: Again, for the price this is a neat little tool. Its narrow and light enough to place in a pencil pouch. Gives your more flexibility to use in minimal space areas that cannot accommodate space for a wireless mouse and mouse pad. Works on most solid/matte surfaces and therefore a need for a mouse pad in unnecessary. Mine came with the option of a 2 year protection plan, which is surprising for such a low cost tool. Doesn't tire out the hand excessively.\\n\\nNegatives: Is this a tool for the working? No. It's more of a toy or a tool to use while doing unproductive work. It becomes cumbersome to keep putting it down and picking it up. You need to position the laser for the mouse at an appropriate position in order for it to work. The usb connector does not store away in the device like many wireless mouses do. Why is it not magnetized? Why was there no storage port where the batter is inserted? The power button is flimsy and could easily break off - not a good thing when you need that to turn on the device. Lastly, there is no standby or sleep mode for when the mouse is not in use to efficiently save energy of the battery. This is pretty standard in more wireless mouses now and so far I've needed to change the battery while having it for a months time.\\n\\nOverall it was more convenient to resort back to my wireless mouse and mouse pad. I like this as a neat/cheap gift idea for those into technology and fun tools. Not a good tool for drawing or hand writing notes for any classroom or word setting - it does not replace the use of a stylus.\\n\\nBIG NEGATIVE: I should have research this more, however, to return the product, you are charged shipping even for prime membership. The shipping back of the product costs about 80% of the product price itself. Estimate for return amount on the item was less than 4 dollars, therefore, ill be keeping it.","[]","B00BS67S78","B00BS67S78","AFCKJHLXLZFZF276PQENCPFNXJ3Q","2017-10-30 06:17:07.818","4","True","508"
"176682","1","haunted drive","This really is a good drive HOWEVER, it has caused me to pull out all my hair. I did a new system build for a client and used an MX300 drive after using primarily Evo drives and not having any issues with those other than the price had really jumped. Almost a month after the new system was in place I got a call that the system would hang. Ok, so I drive to the clients location about an hour away and find sure enough, the whole system just hangs and than on a reboot, not detect the drive. I would have to pull the power plug and hold in the power button to drain access energy out before the motherboard would detect the drive. I found there was a newer firmware so I installed that since it supposedly fixed this type of issue. Seemed to be all good after the firmware update so I went back home only to get a call that its happened again. I went back and verified it was hanging and the motherboard was not detecting the drive so I took the computer tower back home for further testing. Back home, it worked flawless, ran it for days and tried everything I could think of the get this to hang! Unable to find anything wrong, I took the system back and it immediately hangs. Thinking its something power related in the 100 year old house, I picked up a UPS and ran the system with no peripherals attached...still hangs. Take the system back home again, clone the SSD to a regular hard drive for testing as well as get a second similar system that I could test the SSD in. I took the system back to the owner with the hard drive clone and a second tower. The hard drive clones worked flawless and the 2nd tower now with the MX300 in it which worked flawless at my house refused to detect the SSD was even attached to the motherboard. I left the hard drive clone in the system so the client could use their new computer and I could figure something out. I bought a new Evo drive and installed it and have no issues since. I took the MX300 and installed that in a different system and have no further issues. This drive has cost me a lot of time and money and I have no clue why the MX300 refused to work in ANY computer at my clients location. Samsung Evo for the win! Crucial support did try and help but their only solution was to replace it with a refurbished drive. If I wanted a refurbished drive, I'd of saved some money and bought a refurbished drive.","[]","B01IAGSD5O","B078YN3VW8","AEKPPG5NXVOUTOBRPMWE4QMKDB6Q","2017-05-29 22:19:35.000","4","True","508"
"41259","5","Phenomenal 4K/HDR TV At Its Price","I wanted to upgrade my current 4K TV and this one was routinely said to be one of, if not, the best 4K TV's around for its price range. I went from a 43&#34; to this 65&#34; and it's been absolutely great so far. The picture looks amazing especially when watching true 4K and/or HDR videos/games. I have used YouTube, Blu-rays, and gaming on this TV so far and it has far surpassed my expectations. I have it connected to my Fire TV, Xbox One S, and I sometimes hook it up to my PC for 4K gaming as I only have 1440p and 1080p monitors for my PC. This will only output to 60Hz refresh rate, though, but that's still really good at 4K. My monitors can go up to 144Hz, but they're more designed for that. I will be testing the 4K gaming capabilities very soon since i just got a new video card so I will update this for those results. For the upscaled 4K/HDR on the Xbox One S, it's pretty incredible for a console. I'm loving that so far.\\n\\nWhen I first got the TV I tested 4K videos via YouTube and they look absolutely stunning. I've heard many times from uninformed people that you cannot see the difference between 1080p and 4K. I can say for sure that you most definitely can. The picture just &#34;pops&#34; way more and this TV has great colors and enough options to tweak the picture to your liking or for whatever you're using the TV for. Sometimes it looks better with certain settings for movies and other settings for gaming. Search the internet and you will find plenty of tutorials on how to get the most of your TV for different situations.\\n\\nI can't really say much about the speakers as I have it hooked up to a sound bar and have been using that pretty much since I got the TV. From the little I remember about them, though, they sounded decent enough, but if you're getting this size TV for a living room or something similar, I'd highly recommend getting some sort of external speaker setup such as a soundbar or surround sound system.\\n\\nOverall, I'm loving this TV and am happy about my purchase. If you have the money to spend and want a great 4K TV, I'd highly recommend this one.","[]","B01C5TFNSM","B01CFNURKW","AEI7QBNXME5H3DSWPSCHOSFXYWEQ","2017-03-16 14:48:56.000","4","True","508"
"455153","5","Should have purchased a Kindle a long time ago.","This is probably the best thing that I have ordered from Amazon and I have spent thousands of dollars with them over the years.  During my daily visit to my &#34;reading room&#34; I don't sit in the thinking position but sit upon my porcelain throne and read.  Since purchasing my Kindle I have used it every day for this purpose.  I now have my entire library on it and can take all of my books with me wherever I go.  It is nice going to a doctor's appointment and not having to search for a magazine.  I just pull this out of my pocket and read whatever I want.  For years I fought (in my mind) buying a Kindle.  I kept telling myself that I liked turning the pages.  I finally broke down two Christmases ago and gave myself one for Christmas.  Boy howdy was I wrong!  Now all I do is touch the screen and the next page pops up.  Nice!\\n\\nOne of the best reasons for having a Kindle showed itself recently when the power went out.  I opened up my Kindle and the internal light made reading easy.  I entertained myself without power.  I didn't know that was possible.\\n\\nIf you are planning to get one I suggest getting the premium leather cover.  It adds a certain distinction and all I have to do to turn it on is to open it up.  Turning it off is just as easy.  Just close it.  I also suggest getting the Kindle Power Adapter as it makes charging a little faster and you don't have to free up a USB port for charging.  (It holds a charge for a long time.)  And don't forget the inexpensive screen protector.\\n\\nMy only complaint is it is a little bit complicated to find a new book to read when I finish reading a book. (Really bad when I am reading a series.)  However, I will quickly admit that this is my problem.  I keep forgetting how to do it and have to fiddle around with it for a few minutes each time.\\n\\nBottom line?  Quit arguing with yourself and get a Kindle.  You won't be sorry.\\n\\nOne final thought:  There are several websites where you can find free and very CHEAP ebooks.  I have added to my library significantly by doing this without spending much money.","[]","B00OQVZDJM","B00OQVZDJM","AHEMOQGBZVHCI4OD4YEEDVEO3B6Q","2017-04-15 00:17:26.000","2","True","508"
"827366","4","Great for homebrew router *12/18.2017 UPDATE*","I purchased this to replace my aging Belkin router, and decided that I wanted to go the homebrew route.  I ended up pairing it with a 120GB mSATA and 4 GB of RAM since I was going to need two VMs to make my setup work. I'm using Citrix XenServer as a hypervisor since there is a nifty Windows Management console to manage the VMs on my Desktop called XenCenter (combined with Putty, updating/upgrading Ubuntu is a sinch, and pfSense is easy enough using web broweser).  One VM is pfSense and the other is Ubuntu, each with 1 GB RAM.  I also sprung for an Enterprise level AP by Ubiquiti.  You'll want at least a 5 port dumb network switch, too. I needed Ubuntu to run the Ubiquiti management software.  Trying to install and run Unifi on pfSense is a pain...  From an updating/maintenance stand point, it's easier just to run a second VM for Unifi with this setup.\\n\\nAfter loading Xen and getting the network config done, XenCenter did all the heavy lifting creating the VMs (creating them with command line is tough...).  I did have a few issues getting the VMs to play nice with Xen, but that was due to user error.. and unrelated to the hardware entirely.\\n\\nI have Spectrum now and with this setup, I get 120 Mbps down and 12 up all day on 5Ghz band..  The hardware itself hasn't shown anything negative at all.  Thanks to the Unifi AP/pfSense combo, WiFi is buttery smooth for every single device I can throw at it. Roughly two dozen concurrent devices show no issues whatsoever and it's been about two months now, and it stays powered on for weeks at a time.  Power draw is super low, too.  It stays below 15W or so regardless of load.  It has a tiny footprint as well.  It takes up a tiny amount of desk real estate; it's like 6&#34; x 6&#34;\\n\\nUPDATE 12/18/2017 ** This processor does not support AES-NI... Just learned of this and wish I would have discovered this sooner because pfSense 2.5 and beyond will require the processor to support AES-NI.

It'll probably get the job done, but it is clearly manufactured to a price point.  This feels more like a backpack that upper-middle class soccer mom's would buy for their kids exclusively because of the price.  It does not feel like a real workhorse.\\n\\nI'm used to a Pelican U100.  The only reason I'm replacing it is because it won't fit in the lockers at the gym and this leads to all sorts of horrible hassles.  The Pelican has me spoiled.  Admittedly, the Pelican is significantly more expensive.\\n\\nFor example, the Pelican zippers feel like military-grade, made-for-a-tank zippers.  The zippers in the Surge feel like they are a step or two up from the cheapest zippers you may find in the world's cheapest  pencil pouch.  With the Pelican, I can open any of the zippers with one hand, grab what I need, and zip it back with one hand.  That's very helpful in class when I just need to grab a pencil or something.  The Surge is clunky and requires two hands.  The covers for the zippers continually get jammed into the zipper if you don't explicitly stop them.\\n\\nI had my reservations about the front &#34;triangle&#34; cover system of the Surge.  Instead of a good, strong zipper covering a large pouch with lots of organization, I now have to unzip two zippers AND undo the plastic clip.  This is convoluted, slow, obnoxious, and wreaks of design not meant for people who intend to get things done.  Not cool.\\n\\nThe organizer section is adequate, but North Face even shows their intentions with their little phone icon area.  Modern phones would have to be caseless in order to fit in the phone section.  Luckily, their pouch intended for an audio device will suffice  even if it's a hair snug.\\n\\nOverall, it does seem like a better-than-average backpack.  It's clearly not meant for anything too off the beaten path.  I believe it is significantly over priced and probably relies on its image to justify the cost.  Make sure to find one locally and inspect it.  I do not understand the high rating of this backpack.","[]","B00OQWR3G2","B00OQWR3G2","AGZQXM4HOGFSG7UM3PL43MRDBVTQ","2017-10-14 19:52:04.802","1","False","508"

Only used them at the gym once, I got them primarily for the gym.\\nSome background; about two years ago I got some Beats by Dre headphones, same style as these. Ear buds with ear hooks, but not wireless. They were cool at first. Felt great in the ear, good sound. The little piece on the wire that controls volume, pause and skips, it worked well. However even from day one there were issues. From day one the ear bud piece on the right was always slipping out, regardless of bud size. Even though the ear hook kept them by the ear I was constantly pushing them back in while running or really any kind of movement, maybe 60-70 per 40 minute workout. Kinda annoying but I dealt with it. Long story short they didn't even last a year. The jack that plugs into the phone would need wiggling very so often, the volume control on the wire stopped working. Eventually the sound went out in one ear and ultimately I chucked them. Literally chucked them out my work van window. Waste of $140.\\nThe last 2 years I've been using some old school headphones, but really wanted to try my luck at some more modern headphones. The idea of dropping another $120 plus again though made it nearly impossible to pull the trigger.\\nI knew I wanted wireless, earbuds with ear hooks.\\nThank god I found these on Amazon!!!\\nOnly $39, I figured if they lasted only 9 months like the Bears barely did, then I'm only out $40. Worth the risk.\\nLoved the look, the feel while wearing them. I'm not a big audiophile nerd but these sound plenty good to me. I guess there's an app too where you can adjust the sound levels, maybe one day.\\nI've only worn them at the gym once and already they are light years ahead of my previous pair. Only twice in 45 minutes did I need to push an ear bud back in. Felt so much more snug without being uncomfortable. Takes a few minutes to memorize where the volume button sits and also how to skip songs. But I really like these already. Hopefully they hold up for at least a year, but at least they were only $39.\\nI'll update this review if things change or if after a year I still like them.

I am on my third of these in three years, so please allow me to clarify why I gave the product a five-star rating (and also why I love Amazon):\\n\\nI originally purchased the cable because the one that had come with my iPhone 5S had worn out at the device end, due to no reinforcement to prevent fraying due to wiggle (thanks, Apple).  The first version of the Amazon cable had ends which were blocky and bulky, and looked much lower-quality; as a result, it was a very snug fit to even seat in my iPhone 5S with its Lifeproof case.  After a year, the sheath on device end of the cable had pulled out of the collar and exposed the wires, and the current to the phone would intermittently cut out.  I called Amazon just before the one-year mark, explained the situation, and that it was my ONLY device cable for charging my phone (le gasp!) - they agreed to replace it, and had it shipped overnight at no cost.  When it arrived, I noticed that the device end of the cable had been considerably slimmed down, and that the cable itself was slightly slimmer, though not as much so as the Apple OEM cable.\\n\\nFast-forward a year, and the replacement for the original Amazon cable was starting to have the same problem as the first, although nowhere near as badly as the first.  I called Amazon again, expecting to be told that I was on a replacement, and that I'd need to buy one this time, but to my pleasant surprise, was sent another replacement overnight, with their apologies.\\n\\nWhen this second replacement cable arrived, I noted that Amazon had NOT been resting on their laurels (do they ever?)...this third and final cable was virtually indistinguishable from the Apple OEM cable - slim, sleek, and with a very high-quality feeling; the device end cable fits easily into my phone, even through the case (my little tank of a 5S is still going, though will likely be retired soon).\\n\\nThank you, Amazon, for producing such a worthy alternative/replacement without Apple's absurd cost.","[]","B00NH131LY","B00NH131LY","AGJ6DBTCGFDEOSAE3XKW4WFBRKGQ","2017-07-12 16:26:33.368","0","False","507"
"605695","1","it does not work with Windows 7 Professional sp2. ...","it does not work with Windows 7 Professional sp2.  Does not work with Ubuntu Linux 16.04LTS.  Apparently REQUIRES  windows 8 or higher.  I managed to get this working with LG k20.  It did not work with LG k7 or Samsung Galaxy Core Prime, both fairly new Android phones but they have to have solid OTG support.  I am not happy about the mirror attachment as the image is totally blurry when trying to view anything through this 1 mirror that came with the camera. Ok, there is a plastic film on the mirror, remove that, but still image quality is poor especially with the LED lights on, there is a glare back into the camera from the LED reflection of the mirror piece. That makes it useless for viewing in tight spaces around corners which I need it to do.  Also the it came with some weird wire attachments with no instructions.  One has a hook and other has a magnet. The magnet is so tiny so weak that it cannot hold the weight of this use wire up, it just falls down. Its useless accessories.  The CamerFi App will keep taking you to Google Play store to Download CameraFi2 which I did.  The apps are using as much as 17-18Mb of storage. They ask alot of permissions such as identity and account information.  its written by developers in asia and requires a lot of permissions and priveleges on your phone.  So if you have security and or privacy concerns, beware.  They have a banner ad that blocks a good portion of the screens and menus making it dificult to use also on exit they try and sell you other apps.  Very annoying.  This item has poor resolution and visibility without alot of lighting.  It has a built in light on the end but it does little to help. It cannot focus on anything beyond a few inches away.  The best image is about 1 inch away from the end.  I think there must be better cameras out there.  I made the mistake of buying this one.  It took me a month to figure out why it wouldn't work with my LG k7 or Windows 7 laptop or Desktop.  I finally got a new phone just to use this device and its not meeting my expectations.  I am beyond return options now it seems. So I am leaving this review for others to see.  The product is cheap priced but you get what you paid for with this one.","[]","B01GKAQ6RE","B01GKAQ6RE","AF56PCMODRLOKHKNHJUTOJ5WI6XQ","2017-09-01 07:31:23.084","0","True","507"

I ordered a replacement and sent the defective one back and the replacement worked great! We had ordered a cheaper set of three Funlux brand but they wouldn't stay connected to wifi and the app kept crashing. These were more expensive but well worth the difference in price. They are much clearer plus have the pan/tilt.\\n\\nPros:\\nPan & Tilt\\nClear picture\\nGood night vision\\nCan take snapshots and video right from your smartphone\\nGreat field of view\\nCan bookmark views for specific recording\\nCan add small SD card for storage\\nCan set alerts\\nMotion detection\\nIn color viewing\\nTwo way audio speakers are very functional and can actually be heard on site and from your smartphone\\nSetup was so super easy and quick (when you get to the step with scanning the bar code make sure you know to just hold the bar code from the very concise instruction manual up in front of the camera you are adding. The instructions were not very clear on that or I missed it.\\nDo not have to be mounted and can just sit on a shelf or table\\n\\nCons:\\nCord is at best 6 feet long so makes ceiling mounting pretty much out of the question unless you want to run extension cords, I don't.\\nVery concise instructions (even though setup is pretty simple and quick)\\nI did not like the mounts for the cameras, especially if you did choose to do a ceiling mount and run extension cords. Keep in mind that I have ceiling tiles so I just believe that the tiles are not made to receive very much drilling, plastic anchors that expand when you insert a screw and then twisting the cameras onto the mounts\\nNever heard of this company before so I hope they stick around\\n\\nThe pros of this camera far outweigh the cons in my opinion and I would definitely consider buying more of them in the future. If I had more outside receptacles, I would consider outside security cameras like these as well. I did quite a bit of research before buying any cameras but I missed the first time with the Funlux and hope I hit pay dirt with these. For the price, these aren't bad at all.","[]","B01CW4BG4K","B01CW4BG4K","AGGGXM5U4LFBBU5XHSFGSXYYVWYA","2017-04-15 00:56:57.000","0","True","507"
"179957","5","Before you spend lots....give a listen to these first!!","Contrary to one post, these over the ear Headphones do quite a good job of isolating the outside noise when in use, which is especially helpful for monitoring audio in recording audio during filming, which is what I will also use them for. As far as the sound quality...well....in a nutshell, these are not just the best Headphones I've heard for Fifty Bucks, but some of the best ever!! One thing that in the Digital age headphone listeners make the mistake of judging a pair of &#34;CANS&#34; by is bass. These headphones have large drivers that deliver very rich but not overwhelming bass. This can be boosted via the controls of the player from which you are listening from. But in all seriousness you will have to search far and wide for a pair of Headphones that are as airy and full sounding as the AKG K52s. Nuances and decay of instruments are faithfully recreated, never fatiguing the ears! One really good example is the track &#34;Night in Beijing&#34; off of Jia Peng Fang's album &#34;Rainbow&#34;. Richly layered and nuanced, you hear passages in wonderful detail and weight! But one aspect of what makes a very good set of Headphones is the fit and comfort. The AKG K52s are self adjusting with a very well made and effective mechanism that's all but hidden until you place them over your head. The Head Band is perfectly padded and you don't even feel it!! The cups themselves are mounted on a full directional floating hinge..so they move with you and shape themselves to your head. The Head Bar is made of metal not plastic so no need to worry about it breaking and it applies the right amount of pressure to insure the Cups stay on your ears. The Cups, larger than most, cover the entire ear which means no need for rubbing your ears after a few hours of listening or recording. With a clean, very lightweight design involving few moving parts, the AKG K52s are made to put on your head and &#34;GO!&#34; Sure you can spend hundreds more on Headphones, but if you do...make sure you never audition a pair of these! Seriously! A &#34;Best Buy&#34; in the world of Audio! And at this price, one of the best ever! What would make them better....only one thing....a detachable cable.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wUDt5lOAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wUDt5lOAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wUDt5lOAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B019EACGSU","B019EACGSU","AFB55W5G6ZNKFF7TE7KFW3JJIW4Q","2017-07-20 23:47:46.886","5","False","507"
"282250","5","Love the tenore (high res),  but if you like loud or remix music,  then your might love the basso","Hi,  I purchased the basso and tenore.  I love the tenore,  because the mid sounds (mid frequencies) are crispy as well as the high and lows.  The bass of the tenore sounds like the basso when played loud (90%-100% volume). By cripy sounds,  i refer,  like the rain, or the sourrounding sounds (mid frequencies).  Now,  the basso is like 40% louder, so,  the bass is stronger and the highs too.  But you loose some of the high resolution in the mid frequencies, because the bass and the highs are pronuntiated or elevated. Try to have a good seal with the earpads because it will allow you to hear the bass better, press them well against your ear and use the mid or big earpads; by the way,  I am waiting for my jvc ep-fx9ml-b earpads to arrive.\\n\\nIn summary,  both earphones are excellent,  but if you want super high resolution in all the frequencies, but specially in the mid's, like to hear crispy girls voices, then; you need the tenore (that's why I love them).  But, if you like to hear remixes or bass songs, the basso can give you like 40% more volume,  plus 30% more power in the high frequencies (girl voices and trebble sounds) and in the low freqs (bass).  If you plan to hear high definition music at low volume, like at 60% of the volume, then; the tenore is better. But the basso allows you to really raise the volume and feel more bass on those songs that you love.\\n\\nI am happy that i bought both,  because i can enjoy music in different ways. Both ear buds fit nicely in my ears and they don't fall (i am a man and around 30 yrs old),  but;  I won't run or jog with them on,  because i consider these to be of high quality. :). Regarding the microphone,  it is not needed,  because when you receive or make a call,  the cellphone uses it's own mic and i can be heard very well without getting the phone close to my mouth, and I can hear the other person with my earphones, so; it works just as if it had a microphone.","[]","B0093VVP0Q","B0093VVP0Q","AHRT5TO2UTFH2KGEJ64GNJDGS66A","2017-01-23 07:48:56.000","0","True","507"
"624952","5","The ultimate professional keyboard!","Build Quality: 5/5\\nExcellent. The top panel is METAL and the keyboard doesn't rattle or flex like cheaper models. Has a comfortable, reassuring weight to it that feels indicative of it's high quality, like a new iPhone.\\n\\nFeatures: 5/5\\nNo backlight, extra media keys or RGB; be aware that the 4C doesn't sell itself based on extra features. It is designed to perform the essential features that are needed and perform them perfectly. And it does.\\n\\nLayout & Design: 5/5\\nThe attention to detail here is evident, and everything about this keyboard feels high-quality, refined and optimized. I did notice that this keyboard sits quite a bit lower than other mechanical keyboards I have seen, which I really like. No need for a wrist pad or reaching my fingers up a mountain to reach the keys. This greatly improved my typing experience and felt much more natural than other keyboards that sit &#62;1.5&#34; high.\\n\\nSwitches: 5/5\\nCompared to MX Clears on the CODE 87 I was testing out, I loved these Greetech Browns waaay better. The keys were just as quiet as the Clears, but these felt clean and crisp where the Clears felt a bit &#34;sandy&#34; as if they were sticking when depressed at an angle. These keys had just the right depth of travel, resistance and actuation point. I plan to test these against MX Blacks, but for now these are my favorite.\\n\\nValue: 4.5/5\\nWith a price of $113 and compared to other mechanical keyboards on the market by WASD, Code 87, Corsair, Razer, and others, I think this is a decent price. Some might argue it is overpriced since it lacks the &#34;extra&#34; features that other products offer (media keys, RBG, etc.). However, since this keyboard performs all its functions simply and perfectly, that makes the price worth it to me.\\n\\nConclusions:\\n- Exceptional design that is clean, sturdy, functional and professional looking\\n- Switch preference will be largely subjective, but I really like the Greetch Browns\\n- On price, you get what you pay for -- quality!","[]","B00SV73J6G","B00SV73J6G","AEWAS4OXQS7VXXPASW663XIXTJ6Q","2017-02-27 19:06:11.000","1","True","507"
"521289","5","so not too bad but not super fast either","I really needed a corner TV stand as it is the only place in my living room that makes sense to put the TV. There were not too many options across the internet, but the price here was lower compared to the everything-ships-for-two-dollars alternative. Due to that I purchased on Amazon. It was delivered one week and a day after I ordered it, so not too bad but not super fast either.\\n\\nI am a pretty small girl with not a ton of hard building experience but I've put together a few typical assembly-required type pieces of furniture in my days. I would say this was quite a doozy as there were SO many pieces, and some parts require a screwdriver while some parts use the L shaped tool they provide you. Those parts were the most time consuming, and difficult to get through as that tool was used in some tight areas where you couldn't continue twirling it you'd have to take it out and keep re-inserting it. It got very old very quickly. I wish all components were made with only a Phillips head screwdriver needed. The directions were very clear however, and pretty well illustrated. All in all it took me about 2 hours to complete assembly, and I only had help towards the very end. You definitely want another person's help towards the end because they can help you line everything up once the final pieces are being put together.\\n\\nThe box was packed VERY well and all pieces were in perfect condition and all included. It was rather heavy but I did manage to drag it in the doorway myself but I would recommend having help if you can't lift a lot. The box is also larger itself which also made it difficult to maneuver alone.\\n\\nOnce assembled, it wobbled a little bit, but I put one extra felt furniture pad underneath the one leg that was not right and it seemed to fix the issue. My furniture pads are a light beige so they are noticeable, but it doesn't bother me enough to switch them out right now since I just used what I had on hand. I would recommend buying darker furniture leg pads though if you have plans to use them on a darker wood floor like I am because the light ones are pretty obvious.\\n\\nI wouldn't say it is the sturdiest piece of furniture but I feel safe with my TV on it. It fits in the corner exactly like I needed and it looks sharp.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613HJEhtd0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613HJEhtd0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613HJEhtd0L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615I9r-hDJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615I9r-hDJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615I9r-hDJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Mom9Js0yL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Mom9Js0yL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Mom9Js0yL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B010EA5ZLY","B092W3K376","AH5H2XMUPCDAULPOIHO6V5QHN7TA","2017-09-08 23:53:12.299","38","True","507"
"872393","3","Good Laptop but Driver issue","First off I want to say that this is a solid laptop. However, Asus and Microsoft have some issues to work out with Asus Fliplock. I recently purchased one of these laptops and when I turned it on and tried to use the flip capability it didn't work. So being a nerdy computer guy that I am I called the manufacturer and started the troubleshooting steps. First off they had me doing all the same things that I had ready tried, like downloading the drivers from their site, trying older drivers, and even resetting the laptop. When all that was done and it still wasn't working I got with Amazon and had them ship me another one.Well here we go again the second one (side note: they both were sealed and brand new) I turned it on like I did before and WOW, still not working. The only difference on this one is that I didn't connect it to the internet like I did the first one. Theory on this is that sometimes Microsoft drivers will overwrite the manufacturer drivers that work better. Once again I called Asus and repeated the same things I did before. This time the tech support guy was baffled as to why it wasn't working. He sent me on to the tier 2 support but said that could take 24 - 48hrs for them to get with me and when they do they can get with Microsoft to fix the driver issue, but they didn't know how long that was going to take.At this point, I am tired of dealing with a brand new laptop that is supposed to work right away. Now with all that said the laptop itself is very nice and I really find no fault in the manufacture. I have bought and will continue to buy Asus products. I think it is an issue with Microsoft changing something in an update that broke the link between the manufacturer driver and the hardware.That is the reason I gave this three stars, it would have been four but due to the fact that this laptop is a 2 in 1 and that function isn't working, I took one star off. If though you don't care about the 2 in1 and want a very thin light weight laptop that is very comparable to the Dell XPS 13, then I would get this one. I did end up going with a Dell Inspiron 7378 and I am very happy with that, it is a bit bigger but still just as nice. Sorry for the lengthy review I just felt like I could help out and keep someone else from going through what I did.","[]","B01LYYUWNM","B0756YGZBT","AHLDUZHI4QMFMHD2E4LPLXLSDWHA","2017-03-04 15:16:48.000","97","True","507"
"908797","4","Does NOT work with all routers, but it does beat Arlo IMO","Short version of my Arlo vs Blink experience:\\n\\nBlink advantages:\\n- cheaper for the default options\\n- doesn't require ethernet connection to your router, base unit is much smaller.\\n- longer battery life and uses standard AA batteries\\n- can record sound\\n\\nArlo advantages:\\n- wider field of view for camera\\n- nice low light images with infrared emitters on all cameras\\n\\nI had a nightmare of a time getting the sync module working with my router. I was torn between buying a new router or returning the Blink units, but then I remembered the joy of custom router firmware! A quick read up on the shibby tomato firmware for my Netgear router and two quick flashes later, the sync module was up and running!\\n\\nThat said, most people are either not technical, patient, or just plain interested enough to go through this process just to get their camera working. Blink has to figure out a better way to handle everyday routers like my Netgear AC1900 right out of the box.\\n\\nI previously used the Arlo cameras (not the Pro version, I know its a different product yadda yadda...). The Arlo had a much wider field of view, but the weird CR123A batteries used had a much shorter battery life, and the rechargeable versions were even shorter!  Having a camera with a dead battery kind of defeats the purpose and my cameras were up high enough that I needed a ladder to change them, so that matters a lot. Also the Arlo did not record sound. On the other hand, the Arlo uses infrared by default, and had excellent night time video, which with the Blink you need the XT camera model for. Finally, the Arlo base station had to be connected to the router by hard wired Ethernet, which did not bother me but might bother others. The blink just uses wifi throughout.\\n\\nThe Arlo also (I had thought) had an advantage in that it had a web app for accessing the cameras. But the website for Arlo is based on Flash, and Netgear does not have the best track record for security generally, so basically there is no advantage there.\\n\\nIn general, I'm glad to be using the Blink systemand I'll be selling the Arlo.","[]","B018HC6PVA","B018HC6PVA","AHYUXRH3BN55LPC5P6NFVARY2L6A","2017-06-07 02:19:34.000","1","True","507"

I tripped and fell, and my headphone was destroyed. The microphone plug got damaged and so did my sound card. From that day on, I had extra noise with every voice recording I made, and as time went on, it got worse. I had no clue what to do.\\nI tried placing my headphones on my desk, which worked for keeping them off the floor, but it did nothing for the long cord that was still on the floor, waiting for me to trip on it.

For me, this was not an acceptable solution.\\nBrainwavz sent me something called, the “Hooka”, which solved all my problems. This product is both simple and elegant, and I want you to buy several as I can see it having more than one use. Right now, I have it connected to my desk, and I am using it to hold my headphone. I also have the extra-long cord draped over it so that when I stand up to walk away from my desk, the cord is safely out of the way.\\nI mentioned buying several, and there is a great reason to do so. If you are like me, you have dozens if not more, USB cables cluttering up your desk drawers. I have so many, I have boxes upon boxes filled with them. They get tangled and become a mess, but with this simple tool from Brainwavz, your clutter can be turned into convenience, with all your cables ready to grab when you need them, and without the tangled mess.\\nI’m sure that you can find other amazing uses for this great tool. The Hooka attaches quickly to where ever you wish to place it, using a wide rubber sticky pad that is still holding strong after several days holding fast to my desk. In addition, it is strong, sturdy and well designed, perfect for all your needs. Since it uses the sticky pad, you do not have to drill and holes or use any extra tools to mount it, I like that. So, do not delay, order yours today.\\nDisclaimer: Brainwavz sent me the Hooka to review.

"876963","5","This Item May or May Not Have An Accurate Description?","I'm still giving this a 5-Star, but the description was inaccurate on two levels.\\n\\nFirst, it states it's 6' long, but after measuring it, it's only 5'11&#34; and if you discount the part that inserts into the devices on both ends, then technically it's only 5'9.5&#34; long.  Reasonably, you should have a full 6' from one device to the other, I mean what if you measured before you bought it and you needed it to be the 6' that was stated in the description, then you would be sadly disappointed when it didn't reach, right?  Well it's doesn't really matter in my cause cause I only needed about 2' of it, so now I have all this excess cable all tangled up in that mess that I try to hide behind the TV and pray that something doesn't come unplugged because I'll never figure out what goes where unless I pull the whole works out and start all over again.  So I guess you could say I didn't really need 6', but that's besides the point.\\n\\nSecond, it says that it's &#34;High-Speed?&#34;  What exactly constitutes as high speed?  How fast is high speed?  How do you even measure high speed?  I replaced my old Regular-Speed cable with this one in hopes that transfer rate would be much faster than the old one, but I can't really tell a difference.  It seems to work exactly the same, so it seems to me that they are only saying &#34;High-Speed&#34; because no one will ever know if it really is faster or not.  It's not like I keep some expensive device in the garage that is able to measure how fast data gets from one end of the cord to the other, but keeping that on topic, wouldn't a shorter cable technically be higher speed since it doesn't have to travel as far?  I'm not an expert, but if you have a 20' water hose and I have a 5' water hose and we turn the spigots on at the same time, which hose is going to spray water first?\\n\\nOther than those two highly overlooked mistakes on Amazon's part on describing this item, which may or may not have affected my purchasing decision, I give this a 5-Star!!!","[]","B014I8SSD0","B0BGNG1294","AEUQAWILNSEWCXKL2BDNMDVLIZVA","2017-01-11 05:18:24.000","0","True","507"
"611683","1","R2 Defect Alert","BEWARE! apparently there is a batch of R2's that come without the human detection feature. I'll start from the beginning: I bought an R2 several months ago. Really liked it, especially the human detection feature..captured people without being distracted by changing light or trees blowing in the wind. So I purchased 2 more several weeks ago. One worked fine, but the human detection wasn't working on the second. Called customer service..guy was worse than useless..didn't have any idea of what he was doing and kept me on hold 5 or 6 times while he checked in with his supervisor. Wasted 2 days while I figured out camera was defective. Sent it back (thank goodness Amazon makes this easy), and ordered 2 more thinking lighning can't strike twice. Received them today to discover that the human detection feature that comes standard on R2 cameras was simply not there. I compared the boxes of my older working R2's with the boxes of the new ones I had just received. Older boxes said &#34;smart technology&#34; and &#34;human detection&#34;, newer ones did not. So I called customer service/technical support..spoke to a young woman who was of no help whatsoever..had to explain my issue multiple times to get her to understand. She finally put me on hold to ask a supervisor to help her..when she came back she told me there were &#34;a batch&#34; of R2's that came without human detection, and that &#34;they are working on that&#34;. Got very frusrated because she didn't understand that that particular feature was the reason I bought addional cameras, and kept saying that I could still use the regular motion detection. I kept saying I should return the defective camera, and she kept saying I should use the regular motion detection, never acknowledging that the two work quite differently. I should have ended the conversation long before. Will return the 2 cameras and don't yet know if I will re-purchase in the future. To be clear..the 1 star is for Foscam customer service..literally worthless and a complete waste of my time as described above. If I was just rating my 2 working R2's, it would be 4-5 stars..I like the cameras for their resolution, features, and intuitive interface, and they are very easy to set up. Hoping the quality control will improve.","[]","B01DJ1FTTS","B09YQXGDQ3","AEA477JT4CAQKHIGQ3SBKOTLHNEQ","2017-08-16 01:37:26.412","1","True","507"
"56283","5","A worthy successor to the Modmic 4","I had the Modmic 4 (with mute)  for what seems like a long time, it served me well for a little over a year now. It broke, through no fault of its own, because I stepped on the cord while it was plugged in, causing the jack to come loose from its &#34;housing&#34;. It then began randomly cutting out, forcing me to adjust the jack when it did. It worked most of the time, but after a while it became annoying. I decided to buy the Modmic 5 after seeing that it was released. I read some reviews that mentioned issues with the mute switch and sound quality. Concerned, I decided to order it and if I had issues, I would return it. I am pleased to say that after a week of use, I have had no issues. I believe those people relieved faulty products. I can say without a doubt, that the mute switch works perfectly, though it is on the large side. I tested it by putting it right next to my Audioengine A5+ speakers near full volume playing Thunderstruck, and my computer picked up no input from the mic. My Sound meter measured an ear shattering 120 dB where I positioned the mic, right by the cone. The switch is much more tactile than the one on the Modmic 4, and is much easier to operate and is less awkward to hold, though these come at the expense of compactness. The sound quality is top notch, and exceeds that of the Modmic 4. It comes with extra 3M pads, and two mounts, so you can have 2 headphones. It also fits perfectly on the Modmic 4 mount, so I now have 4 total mounts, more than I will need in the near future. The boom is much more stiff than the Modmic 4, requiring more force to bend it, but it is very sturdy once you have it where you want it. There are two different length cords included in the box, a rather short one, and a medium length one, which would combine to form a long cord. You can use it with or without a mute switch, depending on your tastes, I prefer leave it on, because I use programs like teamspeak and discord with push to talk disabled, so a mute switch comes in quite handy. Overall, if you are looking for a nice mic to use with your own headphones rather than buying a headset or desk mic, this is your best bet, though your options are rather limited.","[]","B01MCYRKY3","B01MCYRKY3","AGJ5DTIUA4UN7GSA34ZVD3XG7ORA","2017-04-17 15:49:51.000","30","True","507"
"813314","2","ABSOLUTE CRAP!  BLEW UP AT FIRST PLUG IN.","Updated review 18Apr2017; EBL sent me a replacement at their expense and asked if I would try a third time. I have used the charger only once, but it did work, Yeah!!  The batteries only charge in pairs and stops when either one if full; the second will be close to full. I still don't like the batteries; they dont store a charge well and seem to burnout fast. Being as it took 3x chargers to get a working one my rating is 1-2/3 stars (5 possible stars / 3 chargers). They do seem to read this ratings and provide company feedback; I happy about that. Still not a choice I would buy again. My 4-place Lacrosse is mt go to charger for now.\\nPrevious review:\\nABSOLUTE CRAP! NEVER BUYING EBL AGAIN.  Batteries are average, at best. Haven't had a chance to recharge do to failed charger. Each pair of batteries worked for 3-days (11-12 hours of use total) in an aviation headset. So it took all 8 batteries to get about 1-1/2 weeks of flying done. With the last set installed, I cracked open the recharger, read the paragraph of directions provided, placed the 6 remaining batts in the charger and plugged it in to a chorus of electrical snap-crackle-pop. An anticlimactic death for this POS charger. Not even a puff of smoke or acrid smell of plastic burning to confirm its death....just a final crackle-pop, then quiet demise. Yet still left with batteries, no way to charge them and 18 more days flying in Africa with this very expensive fire tinder. Outside the fact, that by the time I return to a mail service area any return period will be void; this charger took up valuable space in may travel gear and will be staying here to warm the bellies of the lizards as they lay across the cooling fire pit to whence this charger will remain.\\nAdded Notes: Yes, this charger is rated for 100-240v input. I still used a voltage restrictor/converter that I use with my other US 110v electical items. No, this did not blow up because of African electrical service; other wise the R/C would have problems also as well as my other equipment.  Cheers!  I'm looking into LaCross and Panasonic for my next attempt.","[]","B00M2RA8XS","B0BS6KLLT1","AEXCZRZ5WS5D34LHZW7RHIMSN7MQ","2017-03-04 08:58:31.000","5","True","507"
"94872","5","First Impressions","Just received this in the mail. My first impressions:\\n\\n**The camera is lighter and smaller than I expected, easily pocketable. Much more so than my previous camera (Canon G12). A lot of advanced featues packed into a small body.\\n\\n**Elegant design that nonetheless appears to live up to its &#34;toughness&#34; claims. The latches on side and bottom have 2 buttons: &#34;open/close&#34; and &#34;lock/unlock&#34; buttons, which make sure the camera stays sealed from the elements. The camera doesn't feel flimsy or plastic in any way, in part due its aluminum housing.\\n\\n**The lens is covered by a &#34;permanent&#34;, clear lens cover/element that protects the lens at the same time it allows for shooting in the rain/fog/mist/car-wash/whatever. It lacks a traditional, opaque lens cover/cap. I might buy one separately to protect the clear, presumably scratchable lens cover from fingerprints if not outright damage.\\n\\n**Microscope mode (the camera's main selling point besides its durability) is quick and precise. The large f2.0 maximum aperature will be good for low light and/or short depth-of-field (DOF) shots where you want to blur the foreground or background. My photo of a maidenhair fern leaf (pinnule) shows both the short DOF and close-focus ability (which could have been much closer).\\n\\n**Lots of customizable options that I haven't begun to explore. Most of these are buried in menus (a criticism by some people), although this arrangement keeps the body of the camera relatively clutter-free. After owning exclusively Canon cameras for 15+ years, I'm finding it pretty intuitive to navigate this new Olympus.\\n\\n**I can't overstate the peace-of-mind of knowing that this camera can withstand some substantial unintended abuse (apologies to camera in advance). I always intend to protect my cameras from the elements; I just happen to really like taking pictures in adverse conditions. This camera, by all accounts, is ready for it.\\n\\nI'll provide updates as I know more. This will be a fun camera to explore.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71X3vdWaDkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71X3vdWaDkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71X3vdWaDkL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B071RSJGXZ","B07145SB45","AGSH6U4UCKCVJQ436ZDAOAETSQ6Q","2017-06-17 02:27:09.052","48","False","507"
"189609","4","Great camera, Buggy Apps","Super-easy setup.  Really versatile small camera.  I have multiple of these, used as security cameras and many other projects where I've needed to record long videos or remotely monitor equipment during R&D activities.  Set's up in just a couple minutes, then it's easy to install anywhere.  The black camera, itself, unclips from the white stand so it's easy to adapt it to just about anything.\\n\\nAs a security camera, it has it's pros and cons.\\n\\nOn the plus side:\\n  *it's easy to set up,\\n  *records directly to an SD card with no subscription purchase required,\\n  *and has a streaming video feed so you can use the mobile app to check in periodically.\\n\\nOn the minus side:\\n  *The max SD card size is 32 GB, and\\n  *the frame rate isn't adjustable.  Therefore, you can only save a few days (3 1/2) of video to the card .  In my opinion, 15 fps isn't necessary for a security camera, and I'd happily trade off fps for duration.\\n  *the motion detection is ridiculously sensitive, to the point of uselessness.  Even on the low sensitivity setting, if there's an outside window in the room, a fluttering leaf or a passing cloud will trigger the camera every time.  If you tell it to give you motion alert notifications, it will drive you bonkers.  Given that their subscription service only saves the motion clips, they'd be giving their business model a big boost if they fixed this so they didn't have to store as many clips!\\n  *You have to use the mobile app.  The PC and Mac apps let you view the feed, but don't let you access or adjust any of the camera settings.\\n  *Most annoyingly of all, the Android app has a bug that makes me log in and take the start-up tour at least once a day.\\n\\nStill, at ~$60, it's a bargain, bugs and all.  I've found so many uses for the camera and it's got so much potential, that it still merits four stars.  I'd probably be less generous if I only used it as a security camera.  Hopefully the software bugs will get fixed soon.","[]","B01CW4AR9K","B01CW4AR9K","AHOIXB6IEPZDZAKGJTINI2W667AA","2017-08-24 22:48:51.450","6","True","507"
"839775","4","A good second fiddle to the PC360's","Very, very similar to my old Sennheiser PC360's (which sadly finely broke), but just different enough for me to have a couple problems with it.\\n\\nCons vs. PC360's:\\n1. Slightly smaller ear cups. Although it's not a huge change it's noticeable to me. I wear glasses, and in the winter a beanie, so if I wear these headphones over top they WILL make my ears hurt eventually. PC 360's I could wear for days on end if I wanted.\\n2. Head band is very stiff. This MAY simply be because my PC360's were at least a few years old and were well broken in, I will not deny that. But I think it's worth pointing out as I've now had the GAME ONE's for a few months and they've barely softened up at all.\\n3. Slightly different audio signature. Although it's incredibly similar I can tell a different in certain areas. It's not for the worse, or for the better, just different.\\n\\nPros vs PC360's:\\n1. Removable headphone wire. This isn't HUGE but it is incredibly nice. In the box is a standard split headphone/mic cord that's quite long, and a much shorter cord that is a combo headphone/mic cord for smart phones or similar devices. This is GREAT for me as I use an Intel NUC running Linux for normal desktop computing and a big ol' gaming rig running Windows for gaming. I can just switch out what's plugged in to the headphones themselves instead of rerunning cords, and with the NUC only having one combo audio jack I get both sound and mic on both devices.\\n2. More stylish. I don't care what headphones look like, but these are, to me at least, nicer looking than the PC360's.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nIf these were priced exactly the same as PC360's, I'd buy another pair of PC360's every time. The question is how much cheaper do these have to be to change my mind? If these were ... $20 dollars less, I'd save the money and get these. That's how close these are. The PC360's are such a close match to &#34;the perfect headset for me&#34; that I can't help but prefer them, but even a relatively small price difference justifies the jump.","[]","B00KK8ZLEC","B00KK8ZLEC","AG4YDO753AUA4NB6KKCNXB76TFRQ","2017-01-08 18:19:44.000","10","True","507"
"715722","5","So far the BEST portable speaker by OontZ","So far the BEST portable speaker by OontZ.\\n\\nMy first OontZ speaker was an Angle Plus. That speaker was the best speaker for the price at the time($50)\\nI have also had the Angle 3. I had trouble with the first one i got and after a year and my 3rd Angle 3 everything was swell. The only issue was the battery life. It was too short. Almost as if they were listening to my thoughts OontZ came out with the Angle 3 Plus with a bigger battery. Not only did they improve the battery life but they gave it a much sleeker housing and it was slightly larger. This gave it a bit more weight and Balanced out the bass by keeping it planted. The Original angle 3 is too light and bounces around with heavy bass and it doesn't allow the bass to come through clearly.\\nUnfortunately My Angle 3 Plus was stolen about a month ago.\\n\\nWhen i went back to order a new one I saw that this one was available. I did not hesitate to purchase. It is worth EVERY penny. It sounds amazing.\\nIt is better than the Angle 3 by a long shot and considerably better than the Angle 3 Plus. It is considerably louder than the 3 Plus and a bit heavier too. The highs are nice and clear and the bass comes through faithfully. With these small speakers and passive subwoofers i always recommend setting them on a hollow surface(think cabinets). It always improves the bass by way of resonation.\\n\\nThey improved every single aspect of it, even the bluetooth range. I can get very far from it and it doesnt cut out. The furthest I've gotten from it is about 50 feet and it was still playing fine. Any other speaker starts to cut off when I pass the 25ft mark\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great priced bluetooth speaker that rivals even the bigger names in sound quality.\\nI have not yet fully depleted the battery so I cant speak for the battery life yet. I will update as soon as I get some more use out of it.\\n\\nBattery Life update:\\nSo far the battery seems to last about 10Hrs when the volume is set to max so thats really good.They claim 20Hrs on 2/3rds volume and I believe its definitely possible.

"874142","4","Nice fast card reader","The Sabrent 4 Slot Memory Card reader is your basic USB 3.0 card reader.  It handles a variety of cards including the old Sony MS-Pro memory cards of which I actually have a few lying around.  They were used with a really old Sony point and shoot camera years ago.  Although I don't use that camera anymore, it is nice to have the option.\\n\\nA lot of desktop and laptops come with some form of card reader built into them, although they are usually just limited to a SD card slot.  Depending on your computer however, these in-built card readers are usually only USB 2.0 and most won't handle the full transfer capabilities of the newer UHS type II SD cards (as found on some of the newer cameras).\\n\\nThis is where having an external memory card reader comes into its own.  The Sabrent is USB 3.0 giving you much faster transfer speeds and it will also handle the new UHS type II SD cards.  I tried this reader out on one of my Dell desktop computers and found that the Sabrent was roughly 40-45% faster at transferring images from my SD card onto the internal hard drive than the built in SD card slot on the Dell.\\n\\nI also have cameras and drones that I use regularly that use Compact Flash and micro-SD cards which the Sabrent will handle nicely.  I've not come across any problems with it. No corrupted files during transfer etc. It works and is just a plug and play device.  Just plug it into any available USB 3.0 port on your computer, insert a memory card and off you go.  Just like any other USB 3.0 device, it is backwards compatible with USB 2.0/2.1 should you have an older computer.  You just lose the gain in transfer speeds.\\n\\nI own a few memory card readers and the one weird thing about the Sabrent is the position of the Sony MS-Pro memory slot, being on the back of the device rather than on the front like every other card reader.\\n\\nOverall this is a nice little, fast memory card reader which would be great for carting around with your laptop so that you have a way to transfer files quickly onto your laptop in the field.  The one thing you've got to ask yourself however is just what memory cards you use and whether this covers them all.","[]","B01D2ZUNZ6","B01D2ZUNZ6","AEB5R4AU3242FXZFI6LJWQMYHKXA","2017-08-04 15:49:54.255","0","False","507"

We must always shut the unit down on a constant basis while watching some form of streaming content....very annoying !\\n\\nWhen I chose this unit to replace the previous Blu-Ray player I was hoping for one that had better performance specs and a longer life expectancy, I couldn't have been more wrong. It's no longer under any kind of warranty so I'm now in a position to have to research and select another player to replace this one...it's pretty much just a giant paper weight.\\n\\nShopping around for another unit in a 100-200 dollar price range has proved fruitless with the overwhelming number of negative reviews on many different brands. The only real mfg that stood out in performance and quality was from OPPO but these units are very, very expensive. Though, thinking back on things, with all the money I spent on these components ( have now gone through 1 LG and 2 Samsung blu-ray players to date ), I could have purchased one of these excellent units.\\n\\nI can't imagine purchasing another Blu-Ray player from Samsung, Sony, LG...etc..but it looks to be I haven't any other choice unless I want to spend around 500+ dollars...I understand this model ( BD-F7500 )  has probably been discontinued with Amazon (not sure) and I recommend anyone thinking of purchasing it to stay away. .

"555438","5","A very fast, yet inexpensive, wireless adapter","This is super adapter!  My download speed triples over the internal adapter!  This is the second OURLINK adapter I have purchased and both provided the increased download speed.  The adapter is also very simple to install and use, at least for Windows 10.\\n\\nThere are some quirks, however.  Frequently, the adapter will not connect upon launching Windows 10, and I must manually select &#34;connect.&#34;  On coming out of sleep mode, the adapter usually requires time to connect -- it connects and disconnects and then reconnects, but it always provides superior download speeds once it has connected, and it stays connected.  One other issue is difficult of explanation:  while download speeds triple, upload speeds are cut by nearly fifty percent.  This reduction of upload speeds was the same for both OURLINK adapters that I have purchased and used.  NOTE:  I contacted customer support about the upload speed reduction, but there were unsurmountable problems with language translation, and I did not receive a solution to the problem.  Regardless, I continued to use the adapter until an accident broke it off of my pc.\\n\\nRegarding the breakage, note well that the adapter is vulnerable to physical damage by external sources.  In my case, an item fell in front of the pc and caught the adapter antenna -- pulling it downward and physically breaking it off of the pc.  The adapter ceased to function in spite of efforts to restore it.  The plug itself had been damaged when the antenna was pulled downward.  I immediately ordered a new OURLINK adapter.  [The new adapter arrived in less than 24 hours using one day prime shipping!]\\n\\nDid I mention the low price charged for the adapter itself?\\n\\nEverything considered, for my purposes, this is a cost effective wireless adapter that provides greatly superior download speeds.  It provides what I need for streaming onto my pc.  Even the reduced upload speeds have not proven to be any noticable impediment to my internet use, and I am now used to dealing with the start up connectivity quirks.  I think the fact that I immediately ordered a new OURLINK to replace the damaged one reveals my attitude toward this product.\\n\\nIf you want lightening fast download speeds for streaming over a wireless connection, but don't want to spend a lot of money, then I recommend this product.","[]","B018TX8IDA","B018TX8IDA","AFSQ6AVC5GMT4QBZXK7OYP3MUYRQ","2017-12-27 22:56:30.434","1","True","507"
"312612","4","As far as I can tell this is the best capacitor for the money here on Amazon, but not perfect by any means.","The aluminum housing is very sturdy and heavy, but at the same time it was slightly warped, one of the corners was not touching the flat surface. Also it would be better to have the enclosure itself driller out for mounting. Currently the mounting holes are on the end-plates, that are thin sheet metal connecting to the housing with four minuscule screws. The weak point in mounting is going to be those screws. I would not trust eight small screws holding this heavy housing safely in high vibration environment.\\n\\nThe cables are 8 Gauge OFC (oxygen free copper) copper cables of high quality. All the cramping jobs were solid. The soldering was OK.\\n\\nThe built-in voltmeter is wildly inaccurate, as the capacitor was charging it would go up in jumps of 0.2-0.4 Volts, but when it was discharging under an even load (a 12V lamp) it would jump all around, for example showing 12.5V first, then 12.2V, then back to 12.4V, on to 12.3V, that was annoying, so I replaced with a similar more accurate one.\\n\\nI would prefer to have the 12V posts on the back and the voltmeter, with a switch, on front. The included posts are very limiting in terms of wire gauge you can use, this was the main reason why I took it apart.

Older models are IMW-255 and IMW-256. The major change is the ability to pair two of these for true stereo sound, one speaker being the left channel, another is the right channel.\\n\\nBad:\\n\\n* The extremely environment-unfriendly packaging, too much plastic.\\n* What &#34;H2O 3&#34; means? Altec Lansing uses different names without notifying customers.\\n* Internal model numbers are not shown anywhere, hard to follow development cycle.\\n* The website shows the IMW-257 model, the downloadable user's guide is for the IMW-255. It does not mention pairing two speakers - the new feature of the IMW-258\\n* The Support section of the website has FAQ, no downloads section for operating instructions, no search.\\n* The loud greeting every time that cannot be turned off - are they kidding?\\n* The horrendous smell of the rubberized plastic when you unpack the product.\\n* The rubberized plastic is dust magnet - do not buy the black one.\\n* The strap ring made of silver-painted plastic - cheap and cheesy.\\n* The rubber &#34;jacket&#34; was not tight enough on older models, seems to have been fixed on this iteration.\\n\\nGood:\\n\\n* Fits a pocket or can be carried on a carabiner, very convenient.\\n* Great sound for such a small size, although highs seems overblown sometimes; depends on music; ok for intended use on carabiner; would like to have a simple &#34;Tone&#34; control which would attenuate high notes.\\n* Decent battery life. It played for about four hours before turning off at significantly lower than the maximum volume. Altec Lansing promises 6 hours of playback at 60% volume.\\n* Portable, waterproof, great for outdoors, although I haven't tried to submerge it.\\n* Has aux input.\\n* Two can be paired for true stereo.\\n\\nVerdict: remove the abominable &#34;Welcome to Altec Lansing&#34; greeting, and I will buy two of these.","[]","B072LNYSVJ","B0725ST7D5","AFRHTLJZGZKLIFF6CVZMBZY2VALQ","2017-06-28 05:49:54.949","12","False","507"

It is also very frustrating.\\nI have multiple devices with 3.0 ports: 2 laptops (ASUS UX51VZ, Surface Pro 4), 2 desktops, 1 USB 3.0 hub(AmazonBasics).\\nThere are at least 4 brands of controller chips here: intel (motherboards), VIA(the hub), Renesas (a pci-e usb 3.0 expension card), and ASMedia (motherboard).\\nOn most 3.0 ports, it does not show up. The light lights up, the disk spins, but nothing shows up in the device manager.\\nOn two 3.0 ports on my ASUS laptop, it shows up and works, but only in usb 3.0.\\nOn my usb hub, it shows up in 3.0, and the read speed is good, but the write speed is &#60;1MB/s. And it frequently disconnects.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it works flawlessly in 2.0 ports.\\nThe problem is not the cable. I tried the cable from another working USB 3.0 external drive (in 3.0 speed, &#62;100MB/s), and the problem is still there.\\nThe problem is not the port. I tried in the same port which I tested the working 3.0 external drive.\\nThe problem is not likely to be not enough power. My hub is powered, my pci-e expansion card is powered by a separate cable, and the ports on the motherboard are not likely to be under powered. On the other hand, if those are &#34;under powered&#34;, how much power would be enough?\\nThe problem must be in this hard drive. I have 2 my passport ultra, and both of them have this exactly same problem. Also, you can find multiple reports of this problem on the internet.\\n\\nThe customer support is not helpful at all. They just say something like &#34;check the cable&#34;, &#34;check the port&#34;, &#34;our drive is good because it works in 2.0&#34;.\\nI will never buy another WD My Passport.

"468802","5","Integrates perfectly with NAS base unit","I got this as an expansion to my DS716+, and it's been working great.\\nIt is a little on the pricy side for a device that only work as a slave, and the fact that it connects to the main unit solely with an eSATA cable has led many (including, initially, myself) to a misunderstanding that device is just a box with a power supply, but it's worth pointing out that there's considerable logic inside. It has its own data control backplane that works independently of the main unit, and allows each disk inside to be individually addressed or built into volumes, queried for diagnostic status or temperature, and perform any of the functions of a locally attached disk. The main NAS unit also has full control of the expansion unit's fan speed, power state, LEDs and power button function, so it really is just a good as flexible as having a NAS with more drive slots.\\nThe build quality is just as solid as my DS716+, and the dimensions match up so they look natural sitting next to one another - the DX513 is noticeably deeper, however, and the side bezels are a little thicker.\\nIt has an internal power supply that connects with a standard and included IEC three prong cable( which differentiates it from the 716+, which comes with an external switching-type &#34;brick&#34;) - this is a nice feature that creates less clutter and alleviates some of my fear of accidentally disconnecting it.\\nIt uses the same toolless, screwless drive sleds as the DS716+. Mounting laptop-profile drives requires screws, and it comes with all the screws that you'd need to put laptop drives in all fives bays at once (if that were for some reason a thing you actually wanted to do), but most people shouldn't need to touch a screwdriver in the setup.\\nIt's also impressively quiet, and I'm comfortable having it set up in my bedroom without it being a distraction - I've been running it for months and the fans have never spun above a low, almost inaudible level.\\nAltogether, if you already have a Synology NAS and you want more drive bays, I'd highly recommend it. If you're planning to buy a Synology NAS for the first time, it would be feature equivalent but more cost effective to buy a unit that already has the capacity you need.","[]","B009EMFXGG","B009EMFXGG","AH2Q7EETEMNU3OHCQOW4XIR2THSQ","2017-01-26 22:16:08.000","11","True","507"

It was getting old and I was starting to worry about it dying on me, so I purchased one of these.\\n\\nSetup was a piece of cake, took about an hour. Transferring 2.2TB of files over the network took a little while, but after that is done, it is set it and forget it, except for updates.\\n\\nIn just the simplest use, you can connect to this as a file server. Just connect to it and it is like any file server. However, just doing that seems criminal knowing how many other features this thing has. Here are the features that I use.\\n\\nCloudstation: This is the feature I use the most. It is like dropbox, but hosted locally. I have a cloud station folder on both of my Macs, and have the app on both my phone and my tablet.

I didn't even know the synology could do this until like a month after I bought it. Much better than my previous solution.\\n\\nThere are lots of other packages that do other things to suit your needs. I recommend you look around Synology's website to see all of the different options.\\n\\nAs I alluded to earlier, I had a few problems. One night, my Synology decided to update itself, and never woke up from its update. It bricked itself. I had to spend two days emailing with Synology support before they agreed to RMA, and the RMA process took two weeks. When I got my replacement unit, one of the drive trays was jammed in to the unit. I had to RMA that unit as well after another two days of emailing. Synology refused to expedite my second RMA, even after I offered to PAY for faster shipping, so I ended up going without the DS216+ for more than a month. Super inconvenient when you are used to using it every day.\\n\\nI love the Synology and all of its helpful packages, but their RMA process needs work and improvement.","[]","B01AUY8CLE","B01AUY8CLE","AHMAROJLLDK6XXUPAENUVASQGRLA","2017-01-15 04:10:48.000","1","True","507"
"28151","2","Too many issues, cannot recommend","These are decent wireless headphones, but there are many reasons why I just can't get behind them:\\n\\n(1) They're tuned for extremely punchy bass.  It's OK for some music.  But for others, it's suffocating and fatiguing and just plain sounds weird.  If you like to listen to audiobooks or podcasts, it's worse - be ready for everyone to sound like\\n\\n(2) The built-in equalizer has a very limited impact, to put it mildly.  You can't really adjust away the bass problems, just modify how intense it is.  If your device has its own equalizer controls, you can savagely cut the bass and it'll sound a little better.\\n\\n(3) For my earlobes and ear canals, they were not very comfortable, no matter which tips I used.  FWIW, I've been using in-canal headphones for 12+ years, and tried maybe 10-12 different brands and styles.  In terms of comfort, these were on the upper end of the bottom third.\\n\\n(4) The ad copy specifically states that you can wear these headphones two ways: hanging normally with the cord behind you neck; or with the cord turned back over the top of your ear.  The latter is supposed to cut down on sound transmission when the cord rubs against things.  HOWEVER, the in-canal part of the driver is strongly angled - an angle which matches the ear's physiology when hanging downwards, but not when turned so that the cord goes over the ear.  If you're like me, wearing the headphones that way is painful and unpleasant.\\n\\n(5) The cable is just too long.\\n\\n(6) Finally, be aware the manufacturer absolutely hounds you with daily emails for a week or two after your purchase with follow-up emails, instructions, special offers, and pleading you to leave them a good Amazon review.  They didn't promise me anything as a quid pro quo for an inflated good review, so I suppose it was technically legal and totally above board.  However, it felt icky and annoyed me into making time to share my truthful - and generally negative - review.\\n\\nIn short, there are other, better options out there.  Buy one of them instead.","[]","B01M3575QC","B01M3575QC","AFEPPE5ZSR5LCCBJZWRSO7SFL5CQ","2017-04-03 19:06:54.000","4","True","507"

See below.\\n\\n07/17/17 - FIRST IMPRESSIONS\\n\\nPros\\n- camera is a fine resolution for a dash cam. If you are filming home movie scenes, get a GoPro.\\n- install easy enough.

I would prefer the camera portion strap on to existing mirror rather than fully covering up the preferred mirror that came with the car.\\n\\n- for the 2010 Prius ///, the camera mirror is too short, requiring the camera to be offset on the left. Then on the right, the mirror sticks out below the camera mirror. Awkward and really cheapens the entire solution.\\n\\n- hatchbacks make the install challenging. I installed the camera internally rather than at the license plate.\\n\\nTips:\\n- have an internal car panel removal set. It will make life much easier and save your interior. I picked up a set for $7.00 from Harbor Freight.\\n- no need to tie into reverse wires if you already have one that came with your vehicle.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H7DQCb2DL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H7DQCb2DL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H7DQCb2DL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WA73GgjJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WA73GgjJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WA73GgjJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01N8QBVK9","B01N8QBVK9","AHFHZPCKOF3CRU5W4CW47UND537A","2017-07-17 13:25:40.963","1","True","507"
"141059","5","Necessary for professional work","I'm a professional illustrator as well as a college professor. I'm often asked about computer recommendations, and many are surprised when I say, &#34;the monitor is the most important piece of equipment in your studio.&#34; This is partly for effect, since most people are expecting a Mac/PC debate or a lecture on backup strategies. But it's also something I firmly believe – your monitor is something that will likely outlast several computers, and you'll be looking at it daily and using it to make critical decisions in an ongoing basis. It's not an area to save a buck – this is an area to buy the best you can afford.\\n\\nOnce you have a quality monitor, you really should include a hardware monitor calibration in your toolkit. It's not cheap, but you need to know you're providing files to your clients that are as accurate color-wise as possible. I've owned several in my 28 years of professional work, and this was my latest purchase to go along with my Cintiq QHD27. This is a fine device from a trusted brand, and although it is designed to work well with the Cintiq, it can be used on any other desktop or laptop as well. There are no restrictions on the software that you download to operate it with.\\n\\nI knew I needed this immediately when starting up the Cintiq. Although Wacom claims 97% AdobeRGB coverage, they don't guarantee color accuracy (nobody does really). The colors were noticeably green, especially when my overly-red Macbook Pro was around. After calibration, the worst color deviation was within 3 delta units, which is acceptable (after warmup, 97% were within 1 delta unit – only the deep blues were problematic). The software allows for a great deal of customization, and has many presets that are more than adequate for most of us. You can specify which color profile you're targeting, which is good if you work for different markets such as print and video. You can also choose between a fast and limited 64 color target set or a more extensive 256 color set.\\n\\nAll in all, it really brought my Cintiq into alignment with AdobeRGB, and for that alone it's worth the money. I'm sure I'll calibrate my other screens anew and those of my friends as well. This is a professional tool for a professional monitor, and is highly recommended.","[]","B01B96L2QE","B01B96L2QE","AHRVFIVYCIFD6KOJQ2T3IKWAZQRQ","2017-08-30 23:13:40.039","9","True","507"
"35604","4","Physical installation was easy enough, but then the trouble began","Physical installation was easy enough, but then the trouble began. I spent 4 days trying to troubleshoot the reason why my computer recognized the card, said it was connected to the two wi-fi networks at my house, but wasn't actually able to connect to the internet. The issue, it turned out, was the Wifi management software available from ASUS' website for this specific card. It was constantly turning on and of the card's wireless radio apparently, about every other second it seemed. To test and see if it was an issue with my PC, I uninstalled it and connected an ASUS USB-AC68 to compare. That one worked flawlessly and immediately I got wifi speeds of 1.3Gbps!\\n\\nI spent 2 very painful conversations with ASUS tech support on the phone, and they both were utterly useless and clueless. The first guy had no idea, and the 2nd simply said that since the computer was recognizing the device and installing the driver automatically since it's &#34;plug and play&#34; then it wasn't a defective card, so I either had to figure out by myself whatever the software issue was, or just return the card to the vendor. no other suggestions, advice, etc. Oh, and he talked (mumbled) fast as f***, too, so I also had to painstakingly try to decipher what he was even saying, too.\\n\\nAnyway, after uninstalling the driver, the ASUS software, removing the device from Device Manager, and then restarting, it finally worked. The two external antennae are INCREDIBLY finicky about their positioning. Changing either where the magnetic unit is located and/or the angles of the antennae change the wifi speed a huge amount. I've yet to get over 702Mbps on a 5G network with brand new ASUS ac router...it seems to average about 525 or 480, but sometimes is as low as 130, depending on the various angles I try. Had I known how hard it would be to get it working, and that I could get nearly twice the speed with the USB-AC68 for about $30 more, I would've gone with that instead probably (the vendor wanted me to pay return shipping and a 10% restocking fee if returning this one).\\n\\nMy PC is a custom build: Win 10 64-bit, Ryzen 7 1700, NVIDIA GTX 1070, 32GB RAM.","[]","B00JNA337K","B099Q9B6JV","AETVFX2A24EOIRPBGPPTIHT2II4Q","2017-10-04 01:31:46.418","2","True","507"
"604535","4","Way better quality and sound than our jawbone jambox!!  We LOVE these speakers!!!","We recently built a huge half pipe in our back yard for my husband to skate (he's basically an adult child, which is fine!).  He has a very stressful and demanding job and skating is not only great exercise but is one of his favorite de-stressing activities, so I encourage it!  Anyway, his other favorite thing is to be able to listen to his old school 80's/90's punk music while he skates.  That just completes the experience for him.  However, it's annoying to have to wear ear buds underneath his helmet, so he wanted a speaker he could use on the ramp while he skates that will be loud enough to hear over the sound of the board, with flawless bluetooth connectivity, deep rich bass, good sound quality and doesn't have to be plugged in for long skate sessions.  We've always used Jawbone Jamboxes but decided to try something new.  This indoor/outdoor speaker seemed like the perfect answer!  We already have a smaller speaker by this company (the E5 I think) and have loved it (use it to listen to my audio books and podcasts in the bathroom while getting ready every morning), so we had no reason to believe this one would be any different and indeed it is just as great!  For the huge sound it puts out it is quite small and light weight, holds a charge FOREVER, has FLAWLESS connectivity and does everything you would want a portable speaker to do.  This has the finest quality of sound with the richest bass of any portable indoor/outdoor speaker I have tried!!  We LOVE the leather exterior and carrying handle.  It's super convenient and gives it a very luxe look and feel!  It's definitely sexy as speakers go.  Just know that if multiple people want to connect to this speaker and you're both in the house or the vicinity at the same time, whoever connected to it last is going to stay connected when you power it on again until you manually disconnect from your device.  I think our solution is going to be to just get another one because we love it so much as have this one be his outdoor skate speaker and get one for me too!  I really can't say enough good things about this speaker and this company.  Beautiful, high quality products, great customer service.  If you buy this you will not be disappointed!  This beats the pants off our jawbone jambox!  We'll never go back.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716jHP8ygTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716jHP8ygTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716jHP8ygTL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bpt41C0zL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bpt41C0zL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bpt41C0zL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71S3R3UXd6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71S3R3UXd6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71S3R3UXd6L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71shplCJTZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71shplCJTZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71shplCJTZL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uQ4zRPeVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uQ4zRPeVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uQ4zRPeVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xx+KcBFXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xx+KcBFXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xx+KcBFXL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yHD1o+68L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yHD1o+68L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yHD1o+68L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00RWH740S","B00RWH740S","AE4SBEJSCJAWM7CRKJDBQF3O7RGA","2017-07-03 18:29:29.028","2","True","507"
"542925","5","Puts WiFi To Shame","I have four computers in my personal studio, all connected to an Ethernet switch. I used to have my cable modem/router next to the switch but when I upgraded my home entertainment setup, I moved my cable modem/router to the living room so I could run Ethernet to my Xbox and smart TV.\\n\\nMy attempts to run Ethernet from my living room to my studio were thwarted by the pitch of the roof of my house over the room in which my studio was located. I couldn’t get to the area where I needed to run the Ethernet cable down inside the wall, so I was stuck using WiFi. My connectivity was sporadic (to say the least) and my throughput was terrible. On a good day, I was getting 12-15 Mbps downstream (MAYBE), and “good days” were rare. I use Synergy (virtual KVM software) to work across six monitors on four PC’s and it was all but unusable over WiFi.\\n\\nEnter these powerline adapters. I plugged one into the outlet adjacent to my cable modem/router and connected it with one of the included Ethernet cables. I plugged the other one into an outlet in my studio and connected it to my Ethernet switch with the other included cable. Press and hold a button on the powerline adapter for two seconds, do the same thing on the other one, and you have a secure connection between the two.\\n\\nI am now getting consistent 70+ Mbps speeds in my studio. The plan I have with my ISP is capped at 75 Mbps. I haven’t checked the actual speed between the two powerline adapters, only the downstream/upstream speeds I’m getting from my internet connection through the powerline adapters. The indicator lights on the adapters themselves say I’m getting over 80 Mbps but again, I have yet to actually test it.\\n\\nThese things are worth every penny if you need to extend your network with something more reliable than WiFi. They’re simple to install and there is essentially zero configuration. You take them out of the box, plug them in, and they work.\\n\\nThe only negative criticism I can offer up is that the top of the adapter is a bit too large and renders the other outlet useless if you need to plug in a wall wart or something with a grounding prong. Other than that, these are great!","[]","B0173CGWFY","B0BYDHF6YB","AFAD3KHCIXGPVBNQGLVRZ2XSMYDA","2017-12-29 13:54:26.632","0","True","507"

I only wish it had 2 way audio so I could use it at my front door and speak to whomever was there, when needed. Otherwise, I'd give it 5 stars.\\nI have had it hooked up (literally took about 15 minutes (2 canary's) to unpack, plug in and download the app (it walks you through everything). I have mine set to sensitive because one of the things I'm trying to figure out is which of my pets is making a mess and until I figure it out, I choose to be notified on EVERY activation. It's kind of interesting. My pets usually lay around when I'm home, but it's neat to watch them being active when I'm not home. :-)\\nThey are in color except when in night mode. I wish night mode didn't mean black and white, but meant sleep mode instead and if enough light is present, the camera can be in color instead of forced to black/white. I'm a day sleeper so it's plenty bright but still records events in black/white since it's in sleep mode. I'll be manually changing it to home/away during sleep and see how that works instead. You can even pre-set it to when you want it in sleep mode and this is great if you keep a normal schedule, which I do not.\\nThe flex is very flexible. I can point it up/down/side, etc and adjust it as needed. The all in one and flex are both pretty small and unobtrusive so it just looks like a small air purifier to someone who may not know what it is. I'm looking forward to when I have company in a few weeks and wonder if they will even notice.\\nThe more units (up to 4) you have, the less 'free' time you've got to view the material. I only have 2 units and can view things up to 12 hours later. I planned to see how these worked and add 1-2 more but it cuts into the time unless I want to pay a subscription. So far, I haven't seen any perk to paying the subscription, but, it's still new and I'm playing with it.\\nI'm happily surprised with the quality of video, audio too and zoom as well. I think it's worth it.","[]","B01N43X53E","B07M7X4Q4V","AFTVZNDFH5M2ZC44FNVZAVRFYUNQ","2017-03-20 22:58:49.000","27","True","507"
"267255","5","GREAT HIGH QUALITY CAMERA WITH MORE FEATURES THAN i COULD EVER IMAGINE and bundle a GREAT DEAL","I was a little scared to purchase a camera online as it's a major purchase,  but after looking locally found that the deal offered was just so much better than paying $795 with only one battery, no memory card and nothing else, so if I'd purchased locally at the big camera store I would probably have been closer to $950+ to get everything I got here.  So, I ordered this and couldn't be more pleased.\\n\\nShipping was quite swift.  There was a mixup on the charger included, and Beach Camera swiftly made good on that.  I have to say I am impressed by all the stuff they included.  The Sony carrying case is very sturdy and could probably be dropped without damage to the camera.\\n\\nAs to the camera, I upgraded from a Coolpix P80 which I used a lot for some years and liked for most of its features until I decided recently that there was something better out there.  However, this tiny but heavy little powerhouse, the RX100- III outshines the Coolpix by 500% in my opinion.  There is a learning curve to get to know all the features, but here are some I am already aware of.  First it has several little focus squares when you focus if you use the iP (intelligent focus) setting.  It goes to macro automatically in that setting and the results are pretty amazing.  It shoots well in dim light too.  It also shoots movies (very easy, again, to do, you just put it on iP and push the record button!) and you have a very clear movie which will record for about 29 minutes, the book says.  I haven't played the sound of my test movie on regular speakers but recorded Christopher on harpsichord.  The camera also has a stop action feature that takes 10 frames per second so you can go to a horserace, swim meet or the like and record in motion.  Haven't tried that but can hardly wait.\\n\\nI have ordered a book which explains all the features so think there's still a lot more to learn, but in the meantime, think this little camera is a great cross between the highest end portables and professional &#34;big&#34; cameras.  I am not a professional photographer but very much like taking pictures.\\n\\nI would recommend this camera, and also the company I bought it from.","[]","B01MQ429EX","B01MQ429EX","AFFGG733FWTSX2SWDFRXYOJZBB5A","2017-10-02 18:59:12.517","8","True","507"
"886860","5","Great for folks who want to experiment with filters before commitment to high end filters","Let's be clear....  this is not a professional set of filters and it isn't trying to be.  At least I don't think it is trying to be.  This isn't a hoya or tiffen or lee set.  This is a budget set with a budget set of filters and holders and that is all it wants to be.  I doubt it was created to compare itself to a hoya, tiffen or lee set.  That said, let me review it on it's own merits.....\\n\\nI recently went to the adirondacks with this set of filters.  I am a serious part time professional photographer and I have some serious filters.  On this trip I was having fun and not expecting to do award winning photography.  I wanted to test out these filters.  I had a blast and the filters gave me endless combinations and therefore endless creativity.  They are super easy to use and only a slight pain in the neck to transport (there are soooooooo many of them).  But I hung out on a dock two mornings in a row with these filters and mediocre fall foliage stretched out in front of me and I played and played with assorted combinations.  I was travelling with a small group of other avid photographers and the beauty of this longruner set is that I could easily share filters and filter holders with other folks.\\n\\nNow unfortunately I didn't get any good photos to show you but that truly is not the fault of these filters.  The weather was horrid.  The sky was pale and lifeless and even the fall foliage lacked luster.  The filters made it much more fun than it otherwise would have been. I am attaching one photo which I THINK was taken with one of the split ND filters but I am not certain.  This was shot at sunset.\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE:  These filters are not going to replace your high end hoyas but they will be boatloads of fun to play with and you are likely to get some really nice shots.  Some of the colors are niche colors that you wouldn't be using all that often but nevertheless they are fun to play with.  Be creative, go out of your comfort zone, experiment!  We photographers are becoming a dime a dozen so why not play and see if you can come up with something a little different.  For the money I highly recommend this set.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QPlFC620L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QPlFC620L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QPlFC620L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B06XSHJP7B","B06XSHJP7B","AFL4UVP2C7RF65QSIQMQEVH3XUIA","2017-12-23 20:31:57.234","7","True","507"

I have several Bluetooth speakers and a nice pair of Bluetooth headphones and I've been wishing that I could use them with my PC. My PC is fairly old. I understand the new computers come Bluetooth capable. But Bluetooth hadn't even been invented when I bought my computer. I've tried using those Bluetooth dongles before but I never could get them to work,\\n\\nI just happened to come across an article titled &#34;How To Add Bluetooth To Your Computer&#34;.  I read the article and I was happy to see that\\nWindows 10 already has Bluetooth drivers installed.  I imagine I was using Windows XP when I was unsuccessfully trying to get those dongles to work.  Not only does the article explain how easy it is to make a Windows 10 computer Bluetooth capable, but it also has a link to their favorite dongle. The link took me right to Amazon.Com and the Kinivo BTD-400 dongle. I immediately put the Kinivo in my shopping cart.\\n\\nThe Kinivo comes with an installation disc. But as soon as I plugged it into my computer, Windows 10 took over. I was getting several messages down on the lower right of my task bar telling me what steps the installation was taking. Then I got a message that the Kinivo was installed and working. I couldn't believe it! After years of trying to make my computer Bluetooth capable, I was finally successful!\\n\\nIt does take a fair amount of PC knowledge to get the PC to accept the speaker or headphone, You have to go to Device Manager and Sound in the Control Panel and Bluetooth in the Windows 10 settings. The volume from my speaker was very low so I had to tinker with various settings both in the Control Panel and Settings. After a bit of tinkering here and there, my Bluetooth speaker was playing Spotify and sounding unbelievably great!\\n\\nI give the Kinivo my highest five star rating. Again, I want to make it clear that even though the dongle is Plug and Play, you do need the knowledge to get around the Control Panel and the Windows 10 Settings before you can get a speaker or headphones to work, But, if you want to make your old computer Bluetooth capable and you know your way around the computer's speaker settings, the Kinivo is a wonderful choice.","[]","B007Q45EF4","B007Q45EF4","AGXCHWHSKYKGQJK2YDG2MBRURQGA","2017-09-11 16:43:43.794","0","False","507"

If there was an option I would rate this set up 4.7.\\nPROS: The keyboard is gorgeous\\n- Light form factor.\\n- Beautiful design. Simple yet tasteful\\n- Long battery life. I almost never have to worry about it. I usually charge it at night, but even if I don't it's not a big deal.\\n- One dongle for both keyboard and mouse give you a lot of real estates to work with other USB devices.\\n- Signal is strong and clean. No lag whatsoever.\\n- The key does flex, but typing is a comfort. The key are big enough where it's easy to reach but small enough to have the keyboard in a compact form.\\n- Amazing layout. The media layout with the function lock is genius. Being able to use the FN function of the keys without needing to press FN is just amazing. Being able to toggle that make it one of the most friendly layout for a typical &#34;commuter&#34; keyboard.\\n- I can see this being used on NUCs and other smaller devices and it's extremely convenient at my office.\\nCONS: The mouse.\\nFor almost every aspect that makes the keyboard an absolute charm, the mouse is its tag along that holds all the negative feedback to this product. You can charge the keyboard but the mouse is battery (JUST WHY?) The keyboard is compact and easy to use but the mouse design is just awkward compare to the keyboard. Having a dongle for both devices but wanting to swap out the mouse is such a conflicting emotion.\\n\\nTL;DR. I would definitely recommend this product but if the manufacture is reading this, PLEASE COME OUT WITH A CHARGEABLE WIRELESS MOUSE. It's DOABLE and I know you guys can make it happen. I feel like it's the only component that I would have to complain about. Over all, it was a pleasure using the keyboard. As much as I harped on the mouse, the mouse is quite responsive and for anyone who uses office work and need to commute through out the day, this is easily one of the best set to get. It's light, it's beautiful, but most importantly, IT DOES THE JOB WELL.

It looked fit for school (btw, this is Momofthree's daughter! 😝) So I bought the light blue one, and a couple days later it came. I was very excited and put it on my iPad Air 2 immediately.\\n\\nThen I noticed something was wrong-the top part of the case (photo no.1) was not completely covering the gold edge of the iPad! I got worried that I might drop it when using it in class and the edge may crack. It did, and I have this nasty looking &#34;battle scar&#34; on my iPad from the incident.\\n\\nAnother small probably-only-I-would-get-bothered-by flaw was that one side part of the case was not &#34;filled in&#34; all the way (photo no.2). I don't know if all the cases were like that (maybe it needed to me like that to fit the cover magnets?), but it bothered me.\\n\\nAside from those two, the case is hard to get off. I had to pull at the edges with all my might to get it off, and doing so, it temporarily discolored the corner of the screen.\\n\\nThe next week, I brought the case to school, and I got a lot of compliments, oohs and ahhs about the case. I kept it, deciding despite the evil cracks and not-enough-&#34;filling&#34; issues. Little did I know that later, the plastic cover edges would turn 2 shades browner (if that's even possible!) and unremovable blue-brown stains and small scrapes would appear from every day school use! (Picture no.3 and 4) I stick my iPad under the rack on chairs, and sometimes it falls out and lands with a smack on the ground! Usually, it lands face up (magnetic cover on the bottom), but occasionally it falls on its side and that's how the brown stains form. Besides that, everyday school use in general damages it as well. (If you are going to buy the case for home, these brown stains and cracks may not apply to you, depending on your home) So I guess what I'm saying is that the case is awesome, just not for school and fussy picky people like me 😆","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61dci8kU6tL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61dci8kU6tL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61dci8kU6tL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zUrr8yheL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zUrr8yheL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zUrr8yheL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KdTy1wC0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KdTy1wC0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KdTy1wC0L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nL8KUw-nL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nL8KUw-nL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nL8KUw-nL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B016EJ4TT8","B01GDNTDBO","AG6XVOWGLPCAHGEKKE6JJTWI2SNA","2017-02-28 22:34:10.000","12","True","507"
"218121","4","Sturdy and affordable for 27-inch monitor. Missing lag bolt and anchor. One part came misassembled.","The mount is affordable and works well for my LG 27UD88-W 27-inch monitor. Even after paying twice the cost of the product to ship to me outside US, I thought the price was very reasonable. I thought the built quality was solid, and had no issues like stripping screws or screws that cannot be removed.\\n\\nThe product that shipped to me is slightly different from what is pictured on Amazon and on the box cover though. Mine came with three holes instead of two, i.e. one more hole in the middle. In the photos on Amazon and on the product box, the wall mount only has one hole above and one below.\\n\\nIn the included manual, it states that I should use 3 lag bolts and wall anchors to mount to my concrete wall. However the product only shipped with 2 lag bolts and wall anchors.\\n\\nI don't think that's a problem since my monitor isn't heavy and the lag bolts are heavy duty, so two is probably enough. I decided to email them anyway. Initially they said they'd shipped the missing lag bolt and wall anchor to me, but after finding out I'm based outside US, they were surprised and asked for my Amazon order number. After some exchange, they told me that two is enough for concrete wall and that was that. So even though I have one less lag bolt and wall anchor, and didn't manage to get that resolved with them, their support was prompt even over the weekends.\\n\\nAnother issue was that the mount came with one part that was wrongly assembled. The portion that attaches the TV plate to the wall plate has a hook that allows you to hang the monitor while you put on the screws to secure the monitor. This has the advantage of allowing you to mount the monitor by yourself, since you don't have to balance the monitor while trying to put on the screws. However the portion of the mount on mine came attached upside down, so I had the take that apart and reverse the direction. Not a big issue, but surprised that it came wrongly assembled.\\n\\nFinally, the center bolt that allows you to tighten the 360 rotation of the monitor doesn't really work that well. I wasn't able to tighten it enough to prevent accidental rotation of the monitor.\\n\\nThe bolts and washers came well packaged and organized.\\n\\nAll in all I recommend this mount despite the issues above.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617ut4wU2qL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617ut4wU2qL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617ut4wU2qL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715SfleclHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715SfleclHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715SfleclHL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZIMrPyyIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZIMrPyyIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZIMrPyyIL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aaNRrWKxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aaNRrWKxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aaNRrWKxL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MIFD4g4KL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MIFD4g4KL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MIFD4g4KL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TSLzB7MFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TSLzB7MFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TSLzB7MFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00ZKFRKIU","B00ZKFRKIU","AHXOCTK5R76XSLVB4YIWEZX3V2OQ","2017-07-17 03:13:34.836","8","True","507"
"252013","4","These are very good sounding speakers for their small size and handle some ...","These are very good sounding speakers for their small size and handle some serious power for a little tiny 4&#34; speaker.  But THERE'S the problem; these DB501 speakers are only 4&#34; speakers!!!!  There is NOTHING about them, no matter how you measure them, cone diameter or frames size, THESE ARE NOT 5&#34; SPEAKERS; THEY ARE 4&#34; SPEAKERS BY ANY SPEAKER MEASUREMENT STANDARDS!!!! This is why I only gave them 4 stars because other than the HUGE SIZE MISTAKE they are very good quality speakers. Helloooo...  Polk Audio, are you listening?  Gees!  You guys are suppose to be speaker experts, how could Marketing screw this up so bad?  I bought these hoping that they would replace the 5&#34; speakers in my Honda Goldwing motorcycle but they are way too small.  I made an adapter plate to make them fit but a 4&#34; speaker lacks the bass that my 5&#34; Infinity speakers had.  On the good side, they have excellent tweeters (as good as the JBL's and Infinity's) and handle my 200 Watt RMS per channel amplifier just fine as long as I adjust the electronic crossovers to cut out any low frequencies below 80 Hz.  Then they sound great and are very loud, clear and smooth all the way up into the highest audible frequencies with brilliant, crisp cymbals.  But you will be disappointed if you expect to get as much bass out of these as the JBL or Infinity 5&#34; coaxial speakers.  Unfortunately, both JBL and Infinity have discontinued their 5&#34; speakers that used to work so well in the Honda Goldwing Motorcycles.  The good news is that they are truly 4 ohm speakers and will not overheat your power amps like the 2 ohm JBL's and Infinity's did, and still sound just as loud.  With the Polk Audio speakers the power amp never overheats and shuts down anymore but did after cranking up the tunes for a half-hour when using the Infinity's or JBL's.  In summary, good speaker but would be a GREAT speaker if it were truly a 5&#34; speaker.  Dear Polk, please make a true 5&#34; version of this speaker and motorcycle owners will love you to death!","[]","B000P0PF78","B000P0PF78","AEVQDYQWA7HVDCJH6XQ4C6H3QRYQ","2017-11-15 14:22:19.478","2","True","507"

It literally comes in a pack of three. You have three tries. You can use the ones you messed up on to get rid of the dust on the next one that you put on. This is also more of a &#34;luxury&#34; (in the sense that it's nice to have but not necessary for the laptop to function) item so don't complain about needing to spend so much money on screen protectors if you are unable to put them on. There are tons of places that offer screen protector installation, you usually just bring in your device and the screen protector you bought. Will they charge a fee? Most likely, yeah, since it's a service. But if you're willing to pay for this screen protector then just go out and find someone to install it for you so you can have the peace of mind of no dust under your screen.\\n\\nAnyways...for the actual review:\\nThis screen protector is FANTASTIC! It is surprisingly a PERFECT EXACT fit for the screen, right to the cut out for the webcam. You really can't even notice there's a screen protector on the laptop unless the screen is completely black. It also is actually anti-fingerprint as far as I noticed. It also feels very nice to the touch and your fingers just glide across it. The webcam isn't covered at all (like I said, it's honestly a perfect exact cutout) so there is no distortion from the screen protector. I guess my biggest gripe was putting it on since it was such a perfect fit that you really can't move the screen protector, but in my opinion that's awesome since I have rarely seen any perfect cut screen protectors. The fact that it also comes in a pack of three is an insane deal. I personally like the way it looks on my screen, especially because of the anti glare function. Sometimes you can see a glare but that's really only when a light source is directly aiming at the screen. I would definitely buy this product if you like a matte screen and enjoy anti-fingerprint/glare features.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71C34t0l1BL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71C34t0l1BL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71C34t0l1BL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81R8MSNe7QL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81R8MSNe7QL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81R8MSNe7QL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00OWH5AWK","B00OWH5AWK","AHLKEPNZQ332DQZWQPL2RHHNR7MQ","2017-03-15 08:20:00.000","22","True","507"
"463394","5","Viola! I have found it.","How can a radio this good sell for way less than $150??  I've owned my share of different clock radios over the years but this one stands out.  After setting it up, the ease of use is refreshing.  Everything makes sense.  It has external jacks for both AM and FM antennas, I love the bluetooth feature which is relatively new for clock radios.  The display is very easy to read.  The build screams quality.  I just don't understand why it doesn't sell for twice as much. Seriously.  So far this is the bedside radio of my dreams.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  The audio can be adjusted with both BASS and TREBLE settings....the sound is very good....It has everything...sleep timer, external speaker jack....they've thought of it all.  Hats off to Sangean.  I also own half a dozen of their portable radios.  The company makes QUALITY products.  If you're looking for an AM/FM/Bluetooth digital clock radio and want quality at a bargain price...bingo!  THIS is it.  I have the black model which looks beautiful.  Though some of the negative reviews could put you off, it is possible that a lemon sneaks in every now and then.  I would\\nrecommend instead of returning it and going for something else...exchange it for another WR-22.  Mine is working PERFECTLY.  It's a great buy.  PS: after using this radio for a few days, some other positives include:  a power on/off button that you cannot miss in the dark or in the\\ndaylight.  Great move to make it orange and (when it's off) orange lit.  Many other radios have a tiny on/off or you have to press in on a knob that does other things too...this is obvious ON/OFF!  The FM and the AM sensitivity with external antennas on both is really good.  I can get some AM stations at night that I couldn't get with other tabletops. Thank you Sangean.  2nd PS: the quality of the display on this radio is one of the best I've seen on any radio at ANY price.  It's easy to read, it's got a nice dark background, the digital numbers and letters are white with a touch of blue...it's a WONDERFUL display.","[]","B009OCBBGW","B09Z7BM86M","AEAK2W377YQO7YSWW2R652P46LIQ","2017-03-01 17:45:19.000","7","True","507"
"24198","5","The SE-215K Are A Headphone To Experience","I bought these near the end of 2016. I was between these and Sennheiser's in-ear Momentums. As a budding audiophile, I love these headphones! As far as noise isolation goes, you are completely covered. Whether you are on a loud plane or commute, or simply walking around campus, these puppies got your back. While these headphones aren't conventionally &#34;pretty,&#34; the true beauty of these headphones lies in the sound. If you are like me and you listen mostly to Rock, Blues, Jazz, and Folk, then these headphones are what you are looking for. The mids and highs are definitely there, but let me tell you, the lows are out of this world.\\n\\nMy main over-the-ear headphones are the Sennheiser HD 598s and even though I like the over-all sound of those a bit better -- because of the type of music I listen to -- I really enjoy listening with the Shure's because they have their own distinct sound profile. I use a Fiio e10k DAC/AMP while at home and the Sennheiser's dramatically benefit from it, but the low impedance of the Shure SE215-K makes for a great listening experience even without an external DAC or amp. These are perfect for listening to music on-the-go from your favorite Apple or Android device and decent enough that they pair well with my MacBook Pro (late 2013 model). I have the version without the in-line controls, so I can't speak on that matter.\\n\\nThe only negative to buying a pair like this is that, for another $100 you could get something like the RHA T10i IEMs. Not that it detracts anything from the Shure SE215-K, but just something to consider in the long run. I also had to make a similar decision and I personally chose the Shure, because they are the best &#34;bang for your buck&#34; as far as pure audio goes. Be warned however, that some people, including myself, experience some ear discomfort after wearing these for a prolonged period of time (after about 3 hours of use), but it is not insufferable.\\n\\nOverall, these are pretty cool headphones to experience for yourself, even though they might get a bit uncomfortable at times. At this price range, I recommend these IEMs 100%.","[]","B004PNZFZ8","B0C3GM8JQC","AEPC2YNOXFUV33HBVLBLKHKGASAQ","2017-02-08 11:00:40.000","1","False","507"

With so many buttons, why not give the option to make it programmable?\\n- Not the best instruction manuals in the box. If you have a special request, you may need to work for it.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Can run all the latest games at playable FPS (mostly very smooth frame rate).\\n- Awesome keyboard, very responsive and comfortable.\\n- Great computer for the price! Very fast and can handle just about anything you throw at it.\\n- Good enough as a &#34;mini-workstation&#34;, and for gaming sessions as well.\\n- Many USB slots and other connections available at the back. You'll never run out of places to connect.\\n- Overclocking is easy. Just enter BIOS and test out bunch of set-ups.\\n- Most parts (except the CPU) can be upgraded fairly easily.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nSo why 4 stars? Because this computer does well what it's supposed to do... To handle heavy load programs and to work fast at a affordable price. It does have its problems as I listed earlier, but there's not many CPUs (AMD Ryzen 1700x) and GPUs (GTX 1070) out there that's at this price and can run as fast, so this seems like a great deal for a balance of speed, power and money (I got mine for around 1,300 so it was a fair deal). As for the RAM, its speed makes negligible difference, but you'd want to upgrade the amount if you plan on using it for video editing, animation, etc. You'd also want to consider getting another SSD drive to expand the space for your programs though I was able to squeeze most of my programs into the SSD out of the box.","[]","B06WGS4C6Y","B06WGS4C6Y","AHGRFRRRFNKXLEUKPFXNZDYLEMIQ","2017-07-24 06:26:43.421","8","True","507"
"287689","3","Just OK for me...","I ordered this headset to match my fellow riders intercoms during a 3 week motorcycle ride. The Sena 10S looks very good and comes with many accessories for different fittings, even though most of these intercoms seem to be designed for full face helmets. Mine is a 1/2 face helmet and I managed the installation by using the additional foam supplements that come with the unit that attach with velcro, in my case, to the over the ears flaps of the helmet. Because of this setup, I had to reattach them to the flaps every time I put the helmet on, which was kind of awkward or uncomfortable to do all the time.\\nConnectivity to my Iphone was a snap, and connected to it without issues every time I turned the unit on. Could listen to music from my phone or to the radio up to 60-65 MPH with fair quality, but a higher speeds or the average 80 MPH on the highway, the sound was muffled and got lost between the sound of the bike's exhausts ( I do have loud Rinehart pipes) and the wind and traffic noise. Connecting to the other riders exact units was also easy, but for some reason could not use the intercom with them, if they wouldn't call me. Once they connected with me, the 3 of us could talk easily a high speeds and even at some far distances. But again, if disconnected for some reason, I could not get connected with them again until they will call me. Weird, and dangerous, because if I had an issue I would have to call them on the phone... Could use it with my phone to receive phone calls, and the call was clear both ways. My complain is that this unit is not easy to use. It has only 1 button and a wheel, and you are supposed to go through different menus to set up the many functions available. Not easy at all. I would suggest Sena to make it easier by being able to connect your unit to a computer and visually be able to configure the different functions as needed before using it.\\nBecause of all these reasons, I decided $200 was too much money on something that did not work well for me and will only use sporadically, so I returned it. It may work better for others. Sena is supposed to be the best brand of this kind of Intercoms in the market. So, you may want to test it and see what you think for yourself.","[]","B00FL6CA74","B09FT43KNQ","AF2QDEVBUZ5WRTJW2Y7MD2WG6CEA","2017-08-29 21:40:15.242","0","True","507"

However, after digging around the Corsair forums a bit, it seems like a bunch of users who purchased a Corsair One Pro from Amazon are having this exact issue, or are getting a BSOD shortly after setting up. I'm not sure what's going on here, if Amazon got a defective bunch of units, or there's some rough housing going on with the shipping boxes, but something is off.\\nI really hope that these are one-off incidents, but I'm not holding my breath. I won't put any personal files on this machine for a while, in case it breaks down. It's really unfortunate that I'm now paranoid about fully using my new PC, especially considering the high cost. If this new unit fails me, I'm going to just request a full refund and look elsewhere. I'd say if you're eyeing this unit, maybe wait a few weeks and keep an eye on the Corsair forums to see if this issue gets resolved.\\n\\nI'll update this review after time passes - really hope it's smooth sailing from here! The machine is compact and light enough, I really want this to work out so I can use this for VR. Thankful that Amazon support has been the saving grace in this situation (:\\n\\n*update* 9/10\\nHaven't had any other issues so far, other than the occasional coil whine during intense games.\\n*update* 9/17\\nHad a blue screen in the middle of a game, did a Hardware scan and have memory failure.

"386529","5","As good as it gets","Excellent computer for general purpose work.  I am working with the i7 with 1TB of storage - I bought the Pro 4 with i5 and 256GB and rapidly realized I under-purchased for my work.\\nThe good (ok great):\\nFast - the i7 Surface Pro is significantly snappier than the i5 of 2015.  Maybe 2 to 2.5x as fast at standard jobs. I'm running some multi-media jobs to benchmark this weekend and will post a followup.\\nStorage - very fast.  Files open and close with &#34;snap&#34;.\\nThe screen is just as excellent as the Pro 4, and that's what got me to switch most of my computing from a MacBook Air to the Pro line. The screen is gorgeous.\\nThe fingerprint reading on the touch keyboard (recommended option) is much faster and more accurate. This tells me that there must be CPU processing involved in fingerprint sensing accuracy as I just switched the same keyboard from the Pro 4 to the Pro 2017.\\nCooling - I noticed the Pro 2017 just doesn't heat up as much as the Pro 4 at any task.\\nSurface Dock - Truly outstanding accessory. Just hook up the magnetic connector and add monitor, ethernet, sound, and more USB-3 to the job.  I use it with a very high resolution Dell display and it's stunning.\\nMixed\\nThe battery - it's significantly longer lasting at the same brightness as the Pro 4 - but I still get about 5-7 hours of useful life. That's at &#34;suggested&#34; or &#34;brighter&#34; settings. I don't use brightest - it's just wasteful.  Battery life could still be better, but it is pretty much good enough for my needs.\\nWish List\\nUSB-C.  I of course didn't expect it, but Microsoft could have upgraded the USB 3.0 to latest spec and added a USB-C to the Pro 2017. Really, it's not badness (I'm not deducting a star) but seriously why not?\\nAll in all, this is more than a solid performer. It's a stylish, good-looking outstanding performer that is suitable for any road warrior or any desk.  This is an excellent followup to the already great Pro 4.","[]","B0714K3YWX","B07D3XXHY7","AG4ERUT3EIEP6V3KTY34L6IYSHIQ","2017-08-23 22:34:10.605","208","True","507"

Try as I might, I could not figure out the instructions for the various shooting modes. I really cannot blame the poorly translated English, typos and run-on sentences. I am just not very good at reading technical instructions and following them. I prefer watching video tutorials on the Web. Unfortunately, I could not find any videos for this exact model. I did, however, find one that was branded differently but appears almost identical. If you do a search for “NW-880” on YouTube, you’ll find the video pretty easily. Overall, I did not find product intuitive and easy to use. But I also have to admit that I am not a professional photographer and this is my first wired shutter release. After a week of using the NW-880, I finally have the hang of it. Now I’m able to time lapse photos. I mostly just shoot my friends horsing around at the beach. But last night, I figured out how to capture “star trails” using the bulb setting on the NW-880. I have always wanted to shoot photos of starry skies. Thanks to this $19.99 product, I’ve taken my first steps into the world of celestial photography. My next project is going to be capturing “light trails” (produced by the brake lights on automobiles) on the streets of Honolulu.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\nIf you were to purchase a professional level wired shutter release, you might spend upwards of $75. This product is only $20 and it is packed with features. If you are a semi-experienced or advanced photographer, you probably will have no problem figuring out the controls. For newbies like me, it could be a little frustrating to make sense of the bilingual instruction manual. But I am grateful that Neewer provided one at all. If you’re a novice and you decide to buy this, just stay calm. You’ll figure it with a little trial and error.

"621440","2","Disappointing software","The camera works but I want to make folks aware of a number of issues:\\n1) My biggest beef is that, unlike many IP/web-based cameras, this one does not stream over http (port 80).  You can connect to the camera via your web browser, but viewing the video stream requires one or more additional ports (for RTSP) to be open and forwarded.  This makes it incompatible with various mobile apps for viewing remote cameras and also complicates matters when setting up port forwarding for multiple cameras.  You cannot simply dedicate one port for each camera in your router's port forwarding configuration.\\n2) The associated mobile app (and thus the camera) rely on UPnP to be turned on in your router to access it from outside your network.  This is a security risk since it allows any software (including potentially malicious software on the camera) to get through your router's firewall for any purpose.  The mobile app does not allow you to specify a domain/IP address and port number to use manual port forwarding through your router.\\n3) This Amazon listing claims that the video is not viewable on a Mac but I don't know why they say that.  It clearly does work for me – however, it relies on Flash to do so  – something unwanted, unnecessary and insecure.\\n4) Neither the mobile app or the web interface appears to provide a means to delete video files from the SD card, other than completely re-formatting.  (By the way, you must disassemble the camera completely to install or access the SD card.)\\n5) The web interface does not provide access to all functionality (like the ability to set the motion detection sensitivity) – some items require the mobile app.\\n6) You cannot set up more than one account/password and the one and only account provides full admin access.\\n7) You cannot view recorded view clips via the camera's web browser interface. If you download the video files (&#34;.264&#34; file extensions), they do not seem to be viewable by QuickTime or by the VLC media player (which seems to be able to view any other kind of video file).\\n8) There are other numerous software options missing like not being able to specify the length of video clips to be saved on motion detection and not being able to specify which portion of the camera view should detect motion.","[]","B074M7B4BF","B074M7B4BF","AFOCIE7BXD3MFO42V5JPO76NDOKQ","2017-11-30 00:09:30.837","0","True","507"

Overall, this is a fantastic simple laptop for any user, especially great for young students.\\n\\nPros:\\n-The screen, though not super high resolution (vertical pixel count of 768), is vivid and bright, contrast is superb and even though it's relative small at 11.6&#34; great for light browsing and YouTube viewing.\\n-Usability: it's light at under 3 lbs., auto-sleeps when the lid is closed, wakes up immediately upon opening it, it has two and three finger gesture recognition for things like scrolling, going from browser tab to tab, and right clicking.\\n-Battery life: with varied, average usage the battery will last between 8 to 10 hours (which is also dependent on your brightness setting - at around 35% brightness the screen is great to look at under most interior lighting conditions, and great for long battery life)\\n-OS: I found the simplified and uncluttered Chrome OS to be a blessing for a light weight computing device like this one. You have none of the overhead of the usual bloat you find in the fully fledged OSs. This is a responsive, specific, modern computer that would suit most casual needs for many types of users\\n-Build quality: the shell uses a durable, light weight plastic, even though it's just plastic it feels sturdy and strong (it's drop-safe from 3' high)\\n\\nCons:\\n-Google Docs app feels just slightly unresponsive, like there's a fraction of a second delay in the way you would navigate through a document editing, for instance. It just doesn't have the snappiness you would hope for. This may be a software issue that Google needs to work out in order to make their apps work better on lower-powered PCs\\n-Inability to make custom keyboard shortcuts - I use the Home and End keys a lot on my Windows machines, I wish Google would provide a way to make custom shortcuts on their OS\\n\\nAt around $200 and under, this is a solid computer that will meet the needs of any casual user. These days most computing tasks are accomplished on the browser, and the apps are becoming more and more optimized for such usage. I love the simplicity of this machine and its utility.","[]","B01H5EFSJQ","B01H5EFSJQ","AH2MGHRCSZZCN2ID7H4QREGLLBBQ","2017-01-05 00:17:25.000","5","True","507"

Superior to even the likes of the Performance MX and the (ugh) MX Master, the MXR, as I like to call it, is a very handy piece of kit for a power user or even a non-professional gamer. It's got some quirks and flaws, but what good design doesn't?

Shop around, get a good used one\\n-Battery life's a bit inconsistent- turn it off at night\\n\\nAll in all, the mouse is amazing. It's not worth $400, but it's a great mouse if you can score a quality used one. Just be careful with the dongle-- Logitech doesn't make or sell replacements anymore.\\n\\nEDIT 7/1/19: I'm coming back a couple years later to tell y'all how to make the mouse even better. There's a piece of software called ""UberOptions"" out there-- it's a hacked older version of Logitech's SetPoint software that removes some of the arbitrary restrictions on mouse functionality and adds in a boatload of other options you can assign to your mouse buttons. The only real troubles are that the options can be somewhat confusing and that it won't pick up on the newest Logitech products, which can be a blessing in disguise if you just want the newer product to work unmodified.","[]","B000HCT12O","B000HCT12O","AHSYEZTCCE4WDVNSMJ4EFEWSUBIQ","2017-04-22 00:27:50.000","10","True","507"

Mindblowing battery backup -- I seriously dont know how can it just go on and on and on.. i suspect some alien thing to be behind it.. 10 days since a full charge (2 hrs a day or more of listening) and still going strong..\\n3. Sound quality -- This is the most important point for any speaker obviously.. very little distortion at max volume.. bring it a notch below and all is well.. Lows are really good on this.. so are the mids.. Very little bass.. (although the bass driver on it thumps a lot but for a speaker this size (6 watt total) you shouldnt get your hopes too high.. i loved the balanced sound quality on this noentheless..\\n4. Connectivity -- Bluetooth 4G .. works in the entire home with multiple walls as obstruction.. uninterrupted play.. However, when used in a car on the move it does skip beats at times.. (i would blame it on the bumpy sections)..\\n5. Ease of usage -- Simple controls.. simple to connect to your device.. nothing complicated..\\n\\nCons --\\n1. Controls -- the buttons have a rubbery although very sturdy feeling to them and that is hardly anything.. the micro usb port is open though (collect dirt).. could have been closed..\\n2.

But it gels well.. matter of taste this one..\\n\\nFor the price.. coupled with a marathon battery and very well balanced sound quality you just cant go wrong with this.. 4.5 solid stars to this..\\n\\nNote: The model in the Pics is black (my camera is playing tricks on me)..","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6120aaqfoFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6120aaqfoFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6120aaqfoFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61M+eb+sMwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61M+eb+sMwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61M+eb+sMwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jcWbfDAEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jcWbfDAEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jcWbfDAEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B016XTADG2","B0935ZDCYD","AGU6WTRDMU52EZLT2ZNQ7R22DFDQ","2017-02-09 22:43:19.000","1","False","507"
"18439","2","Causes issues on waking from sleep","I purchased this directly from the Apple store to connect a new 15&#34; touchbar late 2016 Macbook Pro to a Dell U2713H. While it does pass through 1440p correctly, getting the monitor to actually work when coming out of sleep mode is almost impossible. I have to do a hard shutdown on the laptop, remove the HDMI from the adapter, unplug the adapter, wait to boot into macOS, plug the adapter back in, and then finally plug the HDMI back into the adapter. After many adaptations of this routine, this one seems to mostly work. But that's a huge flaw in this product that doesn't seem to be addressed by Apple and so I cannot recommend this product.\\n\\nI will be buying a USB-C to DisplayPort cable instead, and will have to forfeit the use of the extra USB-C and USB-A slots this adapter provides.\\n\\nUpdate (7/25/17): The USB-C to DisplayPort aftermarket cable was a much better solution and has solved my sleep issue. I now have two USB-C cables running to my two monitors. One is USB-C to HDMI, the other USB-C to DisplayPort. I have absolutely zero issues with those aftermarket cables. With a third USB-C slot being used by the power cable, I am down to a single USB-C port.\\n\\nBefore forking over more money for a USB-C hub, I decided to try and use this product as a hub on that final slot. I have a USB-C external hard drive I use for Time Machine. This adapter does not support data throughput via USB-C, so I cannot use it for that. It literally can only be used to support charging. I have my keyboard plugged into the USB-A slot, which works well. But this is not a great setup, so I will end up having to buy more accessories.\\n\\nApple needs to stop and think about the user experience here. As the original coiner of the term, they've sure fell a long way from the tree that Don Norman helped grow. After spending almost $3k on a laptop, I'm now spending hundreds in accessories just to get it working with a basic setup. As an software engineer developing iOS and macOS applications, I am chained to their system, or I'd have sold it all and bought a powerful laptop with Linux on it by now.","[]","B00VU2K10G","B00XJ4J4B0","AEWV75FOY4Y3SWK42S7C5QZS7PDQ","2017-03-16 15:12:52.000","0","False","507"
"504767","4","Great Slider For The $$ But Some Trouble With The Details","The slider arrived on time, well packaged and in good condition. It's light weight and easy to carry in the included padded, zippered case. In my initial test shooting with a Canon 7D Mark II, battery grip and a 28-135 macro zoom lens, it had very stable tracking and smooth shots in all speeds except the very slowest. Camera movement can be set to continuous or manual modes and the follow focus pan is a huge feature. The tracking speed is adjustable in all percentages from 0 to 100%. However it does not bump and return at the end of travel. Also I have not been unable to test the time-lapse feature, more on that in a minute. The underside of the slider has 1/4&quot; tripod mounts on each end and several on a cheese plate in the middle to assist with balance. The quality of the materials used in the slider itself seem very good and again the functions I have tested all performed as expected. However there were a few problems... The fist of which was upon opening the box I found the &quot;very brief&quot; owners manual to be entirely in Chinese. Also when I set it up for operation the first time I found that the language displayed on the controller was also entirely in Chinese. I was able to contact Andoer support through a number found here on Amazon and in a short time they sent me a short video showing how to change the controller language to english. As of this writing I have still not been able to get from them an english language document showing how to use the settings for time lapse so I have not been able to test that function. For me that's a pretty big problem but I am hoping to still get that. So I am giving Andoer's support a &quot;B&quot;. The slider however seems to function great at least a far as I can presently test it. I have done my homework on motorized sliders and this one or one's like it are for sale online with different names at generally higher prices so this is a good buy even with a few headaches. Also when I purchased this it was being sold here with Andoer as the seller at $30 more than the $299 Amazon is currently selling for so that's an even better deal!  No I do not work for Amazon or the people who sell this slider, I just honestly think it's a good deal.

"500194","5","These plugs are pretty good.","First, note that this is a Cat 6a RJ45 plug, although it might work on lower (older) categories of Ethernet cable. Second, note that I have only used one and I put that one on the end that is the ungrounded end, the end that does not have the shield connected to ground.\\n\\nThis plug is great!\\n\\nThe slider has slightly different geometry and dimensions than other ones that I've used. Although the individual wires are not a tight fit in the slider holes they are closer in diameter to the holes than other sliders that I have used. The result is that they seem to stay in the slider better as I feed wires into it (less accidentally pulling them out). (I'm not a professional at this, I feed the wires into the slider one at a time and it works pretty well.) Also, the end of the slider where the wires come out does a much better job of holding the wires in place than other sliders I have used.\\n\\nNote, the slider has tiny slits cut in one side of the slider. These slits are above the ends of the wires. These slits need to face the contacts as you insert the wire/slider assembly. The contacts are pushed through the slits into the wire by your crimper. Also note, as with others one end of the slider has larger openings for the wires; this is the end you push the wires into.\\n\\nRegarding the rectangular piece, it's used to assist in wire management. They intend for you to run one pair through each square loop and one pair through the notches between the two square loops. I'm not sure what to think of this but I will say it works.\\n\\nInternal parts sequence, vinyl (plastic) jacket, square conductor manager next to vinyl jacket, slider next to cable manager, wires cut off flush with end of slider, then insert assembly into plug verifying polarity first.\\n\\nI'm not sure where I would connect the ground to the shield, if this were the grounded end.\\n\\nSomebody has figured out a better way to do the 6a plug and this is it. My usual success rate with 6a plugs is about 1 in 3 tries (I'm doing better now). The reason for this early review is because their design differences were an obvious improvement to what I had been using.","[]","B01K9Z48YY","B01K9Z48YY","AEQC2CPQQ7GUPYOIDYSLPKPBVO2A","2017-03-02 00:24:26.000","4","True","507"

They make these in China at about 10 different factories, so the one you got here might be made by the same one that sells them on eBay.

Max surge current is 10 amps, but you'll never see that workout a crazy power supply and lots of cooling. Even at the 3 amps and 32 volts I ran it at, the base got very warm as well as the toridal inductor. It's well-made, but you can tell it's lacking quality control. Mine had excessive flux residue. There is some reverse polarity protection, but hooking it up backwards will probably fry it in short order. It's pre-wired with 18 gauge wires. If running higher amperage, you'll need to replace them. The components are surface mount, but the capacitors are solid and rated 50 volts. The circuit board has a thin aluminum backing to help heat dissipation. There's not much for components on the device. Some diodes, 4 solid caps, some resistors, a voltage regulator IC to supply another unknown 16-pin IC under the large toridal inductor. They added silastic in key areas to help secure the pots and keep the inductor from contacting the top of the board. The two potentiometers adjust the current and voltage and work fine, but aren't labeled so I had to guess which was which. So what can you use this for? It can be used as a portable power booster, power supply for a battery charger, motor, electronic device, or driver for an LED floodlamp, aquarium lamp, or hydroponic light. It worked fine for me with my LED project. I checked outputs and they were consistent and didn't fluctuate. You will want to add a heat sink if running it at high output (over 6 amps). It's a good device, and they are lots cheaper on eBay if you don't mind waiting 4 weeks for it. I don't know how reliable it will be in the long-run. For now though it's a good buy.","[]","B019W4C5IE","B019W4C5IE","AEYSDHMZ6TKCNUEUQN4H573UZXQA","2017-11-23 18:29:04.881","0","False","507"
"510402","5","Best Keyboard I've Owned So Far","This is probably more lik3 4.5 stars, but closer to 5.\\n- I LOVE the split keyboard. It's much easier to type numbers in the top row correctly and in general my typing is faster and has fewer errors. This is more important than everything below.\\n- I'd move the two sides closer together to save space (i.e. have F6 and F7 nearly touching) and put some occasionally used keys in the left over triangle.\\n- The delete key is pretty far away - I'd move it down and put the insert key above it. I hit delete much more frequently than insert\\n- It would be nice if MS and Logitech receivers harmonized. I love my Logitech MX Master mouse, but using my favorite keyboard and favorite mouse requires two USB receivers. My second Logitech solar keyboard died last week - loved the solar recharging, but I couldn't type as fast or error free with it..\\n- I don't like having the numbers keypad separate. I'm always fumbling to find it\\n- Instead of an attachment for declining the orientation of the keyboard I'd prefer an attachment for inclining it. I prefer setting my keyboard on my desk to setting it in an under-counter tray.\\n- I would rather have two center base support rubber pieces on each side of the battery drawer and farther away from the counter edge so the keyboard would work well when overhanging a desk by maybe 1&#34; to 1.5&#34; so that wrists wouldn't hit the counter edge. This is a bigger issue with a split keyboard because the keys are farther from the edge of the counter.\\n- The CTRL+F8 key is very useful to see your Windows settings\\n- I like the raised sections on the F and J keys, but wish they were larger. I occasionally type half of a sentence with my fingers not on the home keys. Many keyboards today don't have this feature, so I consider this an advantage.\\n- A LED on the Caps Lock key would be helpful, but would be a little hard to see on a split keyboard\\n- The key that opens the calculator is cool\\n- The keys are pretty quiet. I don't think anyone will hear you typing in a conference call.\\n- I wish it had solar charging. I hate dealing with batteries, but prefer not to be tethered.","[]","B00CYX26BC","B00CYX26BC","AGYJS5OYFSJL2OJ35SUOYKY4YROA","2017-03-13 17:54:17.000","4","True","507"
"302829","5","Great prduct","Great, easy, do-it-yourself surveillance cameras.  It did take me a while to figure out the settings and how to tweak each camera.  You can adjust the motion area, as well as the degree of motion and audio that will trigger the camera to register as well.  I was considering the wireless ones, but reading the reviews on the constant battery replacement had me checking these out.  Amazon had a better price than best buy so I bought 2 for way cheaper than I could have at my local best buy.  You can even turn off the led lights on the camera to make them less noticeable.  Occassionally, I will experience some delay in getting access to the cameras through the app, but it's not enough to return them or curse them.  The come with mounting equipment and have a magnet on their base to easily attach to something metal.  The wire is about 5 or 6 feet in length which is nice and is a usb charger.  I like having the cloud to store the videos so you don't have to use a hard drive storage that will be filled up with mostly useless videos.  There are a variety of plans you can sign up for but I signed up for free plan which allows 5 cameras to upload for up to 7 days at a time.  You can sign up for continuous coverage but costs a monthly fee.  I highly recommend setting up a motion zone.  One of my cameras is facing the front yard which is a busy street that has a school on it.  I wasn't familiar with setting up the motion zone so the very first day I received over a 100 emails and app notifications.  I would recommend only having the app notifications and not both the app and email.  I can't stress enough setting up a motion zone and adjust the audio trigger and the motion trigger.  You can also set the cameras to arm and disarm based on time of day which is what i currently have it set to.  You can easily arm and disarm them at any time through the app.  The cameras do work.  They pick up loud blue jays, bugs on the windows, the mailman, the gas meter reader guy, and loud trucks driving by as well as ups and fedex delivering my amazon packages.  This is a great product and a great way to monitor your house for cheap.  You do need a good wireless signal though.  My cameras are set to 720p which is the default and is adequate.","[]","B017B2043W","B084T3RMQ6","AH3T3PBIOEPFG73M5Q6OS5ZJRO6Q","2017-03-11 19:53:12.000","5","True","507"
"750481","5","AMAZING","I normal don’t do reviews. So when you read this, actually believe me. I wanted to buy myself some nice headphones, since I’m ALWAYS listening to music. Especially when I’m studying, in college music is my best friend. Anyways, I wanted to buy myself the Beats Solo 3 or Beats Studio 3. I always wanted them, but I had Friends in the past who always had issues with Beats. I was really considering them too, and I even thought about getting the Bose Sound Quality 25 or 35. I’m just like you, looking at multiple reviews from different people on which headphones to get. While I was reading many reviews, I saw someone mention Avantree, and I told myself, I never heard of This brand before. I checked it out, and saw Avantree Audition and the Pro edition. I was really sketched out with This product. It was extremely cheaper than Beats or Bose or Sony headphones so I was doubting  this device to the max. But I saw so many positives reviews compared to the Beats and Bose so I investigated them. The Pro audition provides so much compared to the regular audition, you can find a compare and contrast table on their website. But these headphones are amazing! When I opened the package, the packaging was really nice!! It was really professional, everything was included as advertised. They might not lookin appealing to you online, but when I saw it with my own eyes, it’s was pretty fresh! They’re super lightweight, super comfortable compared to the Beats. The Audition Pro has the bass boosted feature and its amazing! I love my bass, and man these things are powerful! I can honestly say that these are way better than the Beats. The Beats May have a better look but what do you want? Headphones that look nice and perform decently or headphones that looks alright that has amazing performance? Get the Pro, it’s only like 20-30 bucks more than the regular audition and it’s worth it. It comes with 12-24 months Warrantee for no additional class charge so that’s a plus. It even comes with Nice case for your headphones. Initially, I had doubts about these headphones, but now, I don’t regret it at all. I saved a lot of money and came out satisified. Don’t hesitate, Just buy these and not the other ones.","[]","B01A0EAYDI","B0BXX85J3Y","AG2K6EXMW3VB63BEATMKBMZFUY4A","2017-12-23 21:58:18.840","1","True","507"
"304687","4","Minor Installation Inconveniences, but Works Well So far -- Would Recommend.","I installed my new 75&#34; Samsung TV on the Sanus MLF13-B1 bracket a few days ago.  The bracket fit fine on my wall (thin paneling over drywall) because my wall studs are spaced 16&#34; apart, and the center of the wall (where I wanted the TV centered) was within a few inches of the midpoint between two of the wall studs.  So far the mounting bracket seems to function well.\\nI made one mistake during installation that cost me extra time... I installed the brackets onto the back of the TV using the plastic spacers that were included in the Sanus kit before realizing that Samsung provides their own special spacers with the TV.  Luckily I realized that before I hung the TV on the wall (which required two people, due to the weight of the TV -- about 90lbs with the bracket installed -- and therefore was a little scary), and I swapped out the spacers.\\nI subtracted one star from my rating due to a couple of issues with the Sanus bracket kit:\\n1) The Sanus kit does not come with the bolts required for my Samsung TV.  My TV requires 8mmX1.25X45mm bolts.  The longest bolts in the Sanus kit were 8mmX1.25mmX35mm.  This resulted in an extra trip to the hardware store -- actually two stores, because it seems that 8mmX1.25X45mm is not a terribly common bolt size.\\n2) The flexible joints on the Sanus bracket (as received) were unevenly stiff.  One joint was fairly loose and easy to move.  The others were much tighter.  I had to slightly adjust the tension on the through-bolts in the joints to loosen them up.\\nAlso, I learned one other thing during the installation... If you need to center the TV bracket (which can be done, because the articulating portion slides on the wall-mounted portion), you should definitely do that before hanging the TV.  If you try to center the TV after it is hung, the weight of the TV makes sliding the bracket almost impossible.\\nThe bracket also includes a leveling adjustment which can be done after the TV is hung.  (This is very useful, but note that it is best to have a helper to hold the TV level while you tighten the screw that holds it that way.)","[]","B00UNR0KH8","B00UNR0KH8","AEJ3D5XDB3LLHKFWS7XQXB7BOA6Q","2017-08-25 00:14:35.540","19","True","507"

"535896","5","In my opinion this product is wonderful. I've only had it for one day and ...","With every product I order from Amazon i always read the product reviews. I noticed the reviews were a 50/50 split on people liking it. In my opinion this product is wonderful. I've only had it for one day and love it. I have messed with every function that it has and foumd that they were easy to use after reading the instruction manual. The radio is quite loud and anytime I leave the mp3 player to go to the radio and then go back it is left on the last track I was on. I noticed many had issues with this product, which of that is the case the instruction manual says that they have a 1 year warranty. I did find two slight design flaws is that the usb drive slot is on the side, which I found it should be on the top next to the sd card slot. The other flaw was the light function to keep the light on for the clock. It would work better if you had the option on whether or not you eant the clock that would have made the product better but for me it wasn't a deal breaker since this radio will be traveling back and forth from the bathroom when I take a shower to the bedroom for an alarm clock to even my garage when I'm working out there. I love the portability factor because I'm an active person who trains horses and want to listen to music while training them, so when I go to the barn I will be toting this radio around. Even though it's compact it serves its purpose and I love having a remote so if I decide I want to chamge a radio station or simply want to increase the volume across the room without having to be next to the radio it's a great option. My wife loves it because she can plug her phone or computer through it through the headphone jacks on both the radio and the phone. Unfortunately it's not Bluetooth capable, which also wasn't a deal breaker for me since i already have several b l uetooth portable speakers. I even have found it to be functional when plugging my SirriusXm Satellite Radio in it when using the home kit. All in all I have to give this product 5 stars. For those who had issues with operating the radio, i recommend reading the manual first and if it is a usb or sd card problem I would make sure the music is formatted to mp3, which you can easily download music with a torrent app like frostwire or pirates bay and search for the music that has been formatted to mp3.","[]","B0031NF116","B07CH7916H","AEI7FQ46QREBSJEJKS6WM47NTNOQ","2017-02-21 19:54:13.000","5","True","507"
"255248","2","The WD test tools pretty much came up worthless as they cannot even agree ...","I've gone through multiple wd hard drives over the last couple decades and I'm at the point that I'm going to stop using them.  For the last couple years, I cannot get them to last.  For example, I still have a 500gb sata drive I bought in 2003 still going strong as a secondary hard drive in a system I use to play older WinXP games at home.  Hasn't given me problems though I'm keeping my fingers crossed and will not be surprised if it dropped dead tomorrow.  Which brings me to these drives....  I cannot get them to last more then a few weeks past warranty.  I bought 3 drives the last time as secondary/backup only drives for three separate systems.  All 3 died within 2 weeks of each other right after the warranty ended.  This is after I had purchased them as replacements for the same type of drive that had done the same thing.  At the time, I shrugged it off as coincidence as it can happen.  Checked the UPS record and they didn't receive any spikes for the two weeks I could access and the end users couldn't mess with them as access is locked as they are for used for backups.  All three have the same issue as before.  Windows is reading them as 0 memory under GPT and an I/O error under MBR.  Tried initializing them under them both back then and now due to an obscure windows initializing problem.  Comes up with the same problems on my workstation dock and when installed on a test bed computer.  So covered almost every method to see if the drive is faking it or really dead.  The WD test tools pretty much came up worthless as they cannot even agree if you run the tests multiple times.  All three will fail the test, then the next time all of them will pass the smart test.  And it will keep randomly repeating between them.  The only thing that is regular is that it will fail the partition erase.  Now I'm irritated that I'm going to have to start researching hard drive manufacturers after being so long with one company.  It isn't only these drives that have failed me, I've been having a heck of a time with both internal and external wd hard drives the last couple years.  Now I got to get started on a  WD Black label as it looks to be having the same problem from my home system, but at least it is still under warranty.","[]","B004RORMF6","B00DI12KRO","AFJVF3BGNG3HXLBNW432EXVZFFOA","2017-02-12 10:59:47.000","0","False","507"

This radio is perfect to add to our kit because it only takes 3 AA batteries to operate. We are using this radio to replace our older radio because it took six C batteries and we never have them available around the house.

Our weather radio is very good at announcing the dangers, but does not keep you updated on the storm. Thank goodness, we have this radio. We were able to tune it in on a station that was running a play-by-play account of the storm. They even simulcasted local tv station for updates.  It was a life saver, it was able to keep us updated throughout the night. Then with daybreak, the cleanup started and it was nice to be able to listen to reports on which stores were opened, locations of gas stations with gas, and important phone numbers to call for utility updates.  Also, it was nice to listen to music while we were working.

The yardage is constantly updating on the hole.  You can push a button and see distance to hazards and distance over the hazards.  It shows front, middle and back of the green yardage.  The middle yardage is the large number.  The other numbers are also the same size as the hazard numbers that show up.\\n\\nThe watch took a few minutes to connect to the satellite and download the course info.  After that it kept constant information.  The same is true for the odometer; it takes a few minutes to connect to the satellite before it can start recording distance.  I used the watch while walking 18 holes.  When I indicated that I was done, the watch displayed the duration of the round 2 hours and 51 minutes and the distance walked (6.1 miles).  I had about 60% battery left of a fully charged battery.\\n\\nThe watch is surprisingly lightweight.  The only problem is more of a slight annoyance.  With my golf glove and the watch on my left hand, several times during the round when I bent my wrist it would unintentionally press the big middle button, and it would beep.  In the settings, sound can easily be muted, so it's not a big deal.\\n\\nI know some of the other watches have graphics.  Besides missing color, I don't think you will be missing any information on this watch.  The exception might be when you play an unfamiliar course you might want graphics to show the full course.\\n\\nThe instruction manual could be more helpful than it is.  I went to the GolfBuddy website to find the meaning of all of the acronyms the watch uses for hazards. I think this is a good way to go for gps...it is much more convenient than having to look at a phone App.\\n\\n*Update 8/18...the watch has worked well since receiving it.  Then I played today on a humid day but with no rain.  The face got misty on the inside and then the display went out and only partially returned.  It is pretty much ruined.

First, the laptop is as light as the MacBook Air with a smaller footprint, which is good and bad. The keyboard seems cramped in comparison to the Air. Second, no pen support seems a little odd at this price range, and while most of the other manufacturers have at least made their laptops capable of the technology, this laptop falls very short of the pen technology. Furthermore, I cannot find a Bluetooth stylus that will work with this so called, incredible screen. I have not noticed any ghost flashes as many have complained about but the text at times is fuzzy, and it has only been three weeks since I purchased.\\n\\nThe price is incredibly high in comparison to other PCs with similar specifications. I would value this computer, with these specifications at no more than $800.00 at time of this review.\\n\\nAnother thing to point out is technical support, and how they respond to consumer issues. This has become an important feature when purchasing computers these days; I think the tech agents know more about weaving baskets out of palm leaves than computers in my opinion. The level of knowledge that these agents have is less than basic trouble shooting skills, which may sound trivial, but becomes increasingly important when the agent cannot troubleshoot the issue and recommends the unit to be sent to their repair facility in Texas to troubleshoot basic issues at the owner's expense. I find that to be quite troublesome at this price point.\\n\\nWhat I find to be the most attractive features of the ASUS UX360UA is:\\ni7 Sylake Processor\\n16 GB of Ram\\n512 GB of internal storage\\n\\nThe Cons\\nNo Pen Support\\nFuzzy text and at times screen flickering\\nPrice\\nPoor Customer Service\\nTech Support with no technical knowledge\\nOwner has to pay to ship computer for tech support issues\\nMany consumer complaints\\n\\nFinally, the only reason I gave two stars is because of the Intel i7 and portability of the device, which is a positive. But, I would NOT recommend this computer at this price point until they add the features that other laptops in the same price point have and improve technical support.","[]","B0713YDTDW","B0713YDTDW","AGR5IBMN4NUYHJJYSLAXG3NIAVFQ","2017-08-28 06:43:23.326","5","False","506"
"112207","2","Not bad for a basic keyboard","Not bad for a basic keyboard, but keep in mind that it does not have the integration connector for the Surface. This means that it is only a basic Bluetooth keyboard that happens to attach to a Surface. As a result, you will not have trackpad options in your settings nor does the manufacturer include any apps to adjust the behavior. Where this becomes a problem is that the trackpad will assume that any time you touch the edge of the pad, you are making a swipe gesture. For example, if you touch the top edge of the pad, it will assume you're doing a downswipe and will minimize the window. Very annoying.. And you can't disable this &#34;feature&#34;.\\nHere's my pro/con:\\nPros:\\n1) Nice texture and appears to be quality materials\\n2) Pairs easily through Bluetooth, also can pair to a phone, PS4, etc. Anything that takes a Bluetooth keyboard.\\n3) Key feel is good, not too clacky, but not too soft, with a nice clicking.\\n4) Has good features, trackpad uses two and three finger gestures, and there is a good array of shortcut keys.\\n5) Good non-slip backing, keeps it nicely in place while typing.\\n\\nCons:\\n1) The charge cable is difficult to get centered, and comes off with the slightest touch.\\n2) If you lose the charge cable, you're out of luck.\\n3) Does not integrate with the Surface. This means there are no settings for the device.\\n4) Always thinks you're making swipe gestures on the trackpad. Gets to be simply infuriating.\\n5) Sometimes has difficulty waking up.\\n6) Battery life is abysmally short (20-30 minutes)\\n\\nThe verdict: I really can't recommend this product. If there was driver software that allowed the adjustment of settings for the trackpad, and if the power connector was not so flimsy, or at least moved to the top of the keyboard where it was out of the way, then it may get a good for random use rating. As it is though, do yourself a favor and wait for your next paycheck to get a cover with integration. You can tell it has integration from the six small connection dots between the magnets on the cover.","[]","B06Y6778JQ","B06Y6778JQ","AG2WE2MTBD7KYP5E42W6S5Q2YTIQ","2017-07-06 17:21:52.078","5","True","506"

Now before you respond to this review and tell me &#34;But you can use your router's local password to login&#34; - You cant. It never works. EVER. I have had TWO different models of routers with SmartWifi over the last 4 years. BOTH of them have the same problem that if you change the default administrator password from &#34;admin&#34; (which you should You should not be allowed anywhere near the internet if you don't change this password that is the default for every router Linksys has ever made.) It COMPLETELY BREAKS THE ABILITY TO LOGIN WITH THIS PASSWORD.\\n\\nSo, in short, Linksys SmartWifi (Which, really, if you're going t name something with &#34;smart&#34; in the name, it should not be completely stupid.) forces you to sign up for a web-based account to access the settings on your router, which cannot be used if you do not have a working internet connection. GENIUS!\\n\\nThat being said, with this particular router, I have never had such fast Wifi ever in the history of my life. It is pretty great in that respect. I have the thing in a closet. A CLOSET! And I get a FULL STRONG WiFi signal in every corner of my property, even outside. Normally I would add supplemental antennae and repeaters for outside, but I do not need that for this router.\\n\\nNow lets just hope this one doesn't literally melt in less than 2 years like the last one did.","[]","B06X9CPC45","B0B3PSH1VX","AG3HVMZ6NXIXQXL2DRLXIAC4GGBA","2017-10-06 21:43:16.347","0","True","506"
"718162","1","It's another disappointing system in a market of disappointing so called SMART products","The reality is that most of these current gen security/wifi/webcam systems are not really up to people's expectations. You can compare them back and forth all day and you will still be missing things you expect with every system available. I would say the two major positives going for Arlo is the built in siren and flexible camera install. In just about every other area I am dissapointed. Video quality is not good, performance is sluggish, I can't adjust how long I want to capture on motion, setup is a tad confusing, a second battery is not included, price is too high, sharing with family required too many steps on their part, ETC. I wonder if Blink just might be the better option due to it's much more competitive pricing and similar features. I think each of these systems should include free 7 days off on going cloud storage at full HD. I think you should be able to live stream fairly quickly. I think connecting to the camera should not stop a live recording. I think at this price you should get a dedicated charger and an extra battery. The bottom line is features that cost extra money when they should be included significantly diminsh the value of this product. I have used the YI camera prior to this and in some ways it is a superior product as it does not require a hub, has better image quality, lower price and never misses motion.\\n\\nUPDATE - I have been trying to use the GEOFENCING feature for days and the only thing it has accomplished is arming and disarming the system constantly when I am not home. Then when I get home and I have been on WiFi for 2-3 minutes the system does not know it and goes off when I walk in front of the camera. Then the app does not load fast enough to turn it off. If I have to manually arm and disarm the system constantly it pretty much takes the SMART and PRO out of this system entirely. I will likely be packing this up, sending it back and getting a more traditional security system.\\n\\nUPDATE 2 - The video quality is totally unacceptable. Even on the highest quality setting at 4:30 in the afternoon with a decent amount of light I can't make out faces well enough to do anything with them. Sure I can tell when it is a family member, but if I had to turn these over to police to try and identify someone I think I would be laughed out of the building.","[]","B01LR8PG52","B08739SDH3","AFDC7KKYVFXU6AI7K5NDMN5WMQCA","2017-08-08 06:51:01.009","1","True","506"
"977223","2","Amazon service still good, my new kindle fire is bad.","I  become more disappointed almost every day with my new Fire HD 8 32 GB, marine blue. I bought it on Amazon Day this summer.  I still use my Fire HD 7 16 GB, 4th gen more than my HD 8. I bought a new fire because my old reliable HD 7 is full, and this generation now takes memory chips.\\nThe most positive thing I can say is the video resolution is great.\\nHere are my issues:\\n 1. The volume on the HD is a fraction of the vol on my older fire (4th generation). I cannot hear most Audio books, Amazon movies, You Tube, ... Occasionally a commercial will be loud enough to hear.  I bought the 8 for additional memory plus the memory card to watch videos. Well, I can watch them, but I can't hear them. Amazon sent me another HD 8 to check out the volume. It was just as low so I returned the less used fire to Amazon.\\nI have dedicated my HD 7 to videos and audiobooks. I read, use email and Facebook, and shop on the new HD 8.\\n\\n2. The HD 8 is MUCH SLOWER than my 4th gen HD 7. I have to reboot several times a day. If I had a memory card for my HD 7 I would give the HD 8 away.\\n\\n3. The HD 8 is very volatile. It often jumps to another page when reading a kindle book, and jumps to other products while  I am reading Customer Questions, specs, and reviews. This happens enough to be irritating and time consuming. This happens in the Amazon Store. I need to go to the computer to shop, and checking Wal-Mart and Target more.\\n\\nI have used all the trouble shooting tips, multiple times a day, in order to use my HD 8.\\n\\n4. Strange things happen to the keyboard. Sometimes it will make every word in a sentence begin with a capital letter. Other times I need to wait MINUTES until the keyboard appears.  Sometimes when I try to correct my spelling with the word menu above the keyboard, the software thinks I want to remove the correctly spelled word from the dictionary.\\n\\nMy guess is I have a lemon. But if you decide to try this model, use it allot the first 30 days.  My problems seem to multiply with use and age.","[]","B01J94TSA0","B01M3ULMWP","AEBF5CUFPE3C4DHASD6XIQ2OZW2Q","2017-09-20 00:25:46.320","5","True","506"

The Pro + couldn't be recognized by the camera until the camera's firmware was updated via the Yi smartphone app. In order to update the camera it needed a recognizable memory card inserted which was troubling but I used my 128gb Lexar card from my smartphone and that did the trick. I honestly do not know what to tell you if you do not have a card which is recognized by the phone's stock firmware right away other than Yi's website has a list of accepted cards but the Yi forum has people claiming some of those cards don't work right away... Anyway, after getting the sd card straightened out the camera and app are really easy to use and the 4k/60fps video looks amazing! I do not know if the Livestreaming option is up and running yet.

The app can view (which is nice if you have the 4k set up remotely) and control video/photo, timelapse, burst, timer, slowmotion, loop, video+photo and most of the camera's video, sound and photo settings. I have paired my 4k+ with the Yi 3 axis gimbal (which is just amazing for the price!) and the Yi Selfie Stick (the bluetooth remote that comes with the selfie stick is paired after the 1.2.8 firmware update and works perfectly) and the 3 together or mounted on my Manfrotto 785B tripod is just wonderful! The touchscreen is large enough to see everything clearly and brightly and the control system onboard or using the app is intuitive and easy to use.

"496408","1","This Thing is Useless","UPDATE X2: And it gets better. So Amazon asked that I return the initial Kindle that I bought in January and I did so. Now they’re claiming they never received it and have charged my account for it. So now, I’m paying twice for a broken Kindle I don’t have, and after paying over $100 for this piece of crap, WE STILL DON’T HAVE A FUNCTIONING KINDLE. Do not, under any circumstances buy this thing. You will live to regret it. And what’s worse, my special needs child is still throwing tantrums over the damned thing. So I’ll have to fork over even more cash to buy him ANOTHER device when the first one AND the second one aren’t even six months old.\\n\\nUPDATE: So Amazon was kind enough to send us a replacement Fire Tablet. Unfortunately, we’ve had the exact same problem with this new one. And we have been even more careful with it since we know they have this problem. No dice. It won’t hold a charge and it will only charge if you hold the cord in place while it charges. Very disappointed. The first one we got three years ago was amazing, but these two are useless junk.\\n\\nThis Kindle Fire was a replacement for one my son had for nearly three years. He dropped it and it broke. That one had a nice long cord and we had no problem with it over the three years. This one we’ve only had since January 2017 and the darned thing won’t stay plugged into the tablet to charge!!! No matter what we do, it falls out. We’ve had it for three months and it’s practically useless. Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to have a tablet that you bought specifically for your child who is on the spectrum and you can’t get it charged so he can play with it?\\n\\nSo of course, it’s out of warranty. They expect me to return it and wait until their engineers try to figure out what’a wrong with it. I know what’s wrong with it, the freaking port is loose. No way am I going to tell my son that his Kindle is going away and I have no idea when it’s coming back.

"791640","4","Received Different Brand but all is Good.","I ordered the &#34;BM Premium 2-Pack of EN-EL24 Batteries and  Battery Charger for Nikon 1 J5, DL18-50, DL24-85 Digital Camera  with 2 spare batteries&#34;  to supplement my Nikon Charger and battery that came with my 1 J5.  What I received was not the product illustrated but instead a Vivitar charger and two Vivitar Batteries. The Charger appears to be the same charger only with different branding and it came with all the accessories it was supposed to.  The Batteries that I received state that they are rated for 1050ma instead of 850ma which is a good thing if it is accurate and so far both the charger and batteries have functioned fine.\\n\\nA couple of things that I would like to mention about the charger itself .. This appears to be a very generic charger and the battery holder section of the charger can be slid down and detached, so this is a very generic charger.  The Packaging says it's a 1 hour &#34;Quick Charger&#34;, but comparing it to the Nikon charger they are both rated at 600ma output which is likely a good thing because as you can see by the photo's the charger only uses the + and - terminals of the battery (while the Nikon uses all 4 terminals) so this is a dumb charger and is harder on your batteries than the Nikon charger will be. Also charging is indicated by the LED on the front showing Red when the unit is Charging and Changing to Green when Charging is Complete, and there was no documentation stating whether the unit trickle charges or maintains the battery at full charge once charging is complete.\\n\\nFor the money  I'm pretty happy with this purchase for what it is... Two spare batteries for my Camera, and a cheap charger that I never plan on using regularly, but only as a backup to the Nikon charger that came with the Camera for when I am using the camera heavily and need to charge two batteries at one time (which is rarely) or in case the Nikon charger were to fail (which in 12 years of Using Nikon Digital Cameras and 5 different cameras I've never had happen).  If I were to be needing a 2nd full time charger I would just buy spare batteries and spend the extra cash on either another Nikon Charger or a more professional grade charger to get the most life out of my batteries.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OBfGGqgML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OBfGGqgML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OBfGGqgML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gmSECsYPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gmSECsYPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gmSECsYPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rSQNRHOfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rSQNRHOfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rSQNRHOfL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FaFl1DOkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FaFl1DOkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FaFl1DOkL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00ZVJ04II","B00ZVJ04II","AEC2H4W35LIYGIZTW7X7ECYJIKGQ","2017-05-16 21:42:02.000","2","True","506"
"175730","5","Excellent high resolution bluetooth mouse which works well on both PC and Macs.  Provides both a left and right mouse button.","I tested this Bluetooth 3 mouse on both a OSX 10.12.6 Mac and a Windows 10 PC.  Setting this mouse up on a Mac is a bit more complicated, and I describe the process below.  But suffice it to say that this mouse works well on both Macs and PCs and it deserves 5 stars for providing medium, high and very high resolution.  The use of the blue LED optics allows for 1600 DPI tracking which makes working on Adobe Illustrator a joy.\\n\\nMac users need to pair the mouse upon first use by turning on the mouse so that the white LED underneath the switch is flashing, going to the Bluetooth panel and selecting “HP Spectra Bluetooth Mouse 500” and pressing pair.  This only needs to be done the first time.  Then go to the system preferences folder, select “Mouse” and then press the “Set Up Bluetooth Mouse” button.  The “HP Spectra Bluetooth Mouse 500” will be listed there if you were successful  at pairing it.  Return to the Mouse panel and select the tracking speed, scrolling speed and the double-click speed.  Defaults from previous selections will be there already, and if you are happy, you can simply use those.  However, this mouse has no “primary mouse button” but provides both a left and a right mouse button.  Note that you cannot see the buttons.  You simply press on the top left or the top right and the appropriate mouse button is activated.  Thus, you should set the Primary mouse button to “left” to you will end up with two right mouse buttons.  Don't blame HP.  The Mac dose not play well with items not made by Apple.  Nevertheless, this mouse works great on a Mac, and having a scroll wheel is very nice.  Note that you the scroll direction checkbox at the top of the mouse panel seems to do nothing at all with this mouse, which defaults to a normal scroll direction based on the direction you roll the button.  What is very nice is that if you turn the mouse off, your are notified that it is no longer connected.  Then days or weeks later, when you turn the mouse back on, you are notified that it is connected and all your previous settings are remembered.  This is also true on a PC, but when a Mac behaves well with non-apple devices, I am pleasantly surprised.","[]","B06XVD75QP","B06XVD75QP","AGVYAXSGNJAHNKABVZQE6LQQG2DQ","2017-08-05 23:47:15.647","0","False","506"
"992479","5","Perhaps the best fisheye lens considering its high optics and affordable value.","I brought the version II with NX mount. I was not sure between this lens or the Samsung NX 10mm fisheye lens. The NX lens has all the &#34;extras&#34; that would make it great (electronic extras like auto focus and exposition, and the feature button etc). But when it comes to fisheye photography, most of the time you will use the lens at &#34;infinite&#34; and full aperture settings. In the occasion I have to focus closer, I just press the &#34;OK&#34; button of my NX1 and the manual focus assist comes to help (notice this feature on NX1 works also for non Samsung lenses by pressing the OK button - This is not included on the manual). So with Samyang and other brands of lenses I have no issue with manual focusing. The aperture ring of this lens is also so simple to use, there is no issue with that being manual neither. Now on the side of the optics, this lens is just awesome and a F2.8 (this lens) is better than the F3.5 of the NX 10mm lens;  it would work on dimmer light environment and allows faster shutting speeds.\\nThis lens is so little and way heavier than expected (250-275g)! It is very well made. The rings are smooth without being loose. After using it some times, I know my aperture by the feeling of the ring while rotating without needing to read it. The sun hood is perfect to prevent flares and to protect the lens. The front element is entirely covered by this hood.\\n\\nI have compared this lens with my friends as well as online photography forums and this choice is by far the best fisheye lens I have seen. The colors are just stunning right out of the camera. If I loose all my gear, I would buy this lens again in no time. Fisheye photography is fun and with way more options that expected. This is a high quality fisheye lens, I am quite happy with it and Samyang produces it with several other mounts (NX/Canon/Fuji/Sony).\\n\\nFisheye photography is not something we use for specific needs. I did not wanted to spend too much on it. I made the best choice with this lens. I am using it way more than I was expecting.","[]","B00JD4T8PM","B00JD4T8PM","AFATHSYPNPM2R2TLIETGUVRA63QQ","2017-05-13 17:07:02.000","0","True","506"

But I'm an amateur with a 4,200 sq ft home that has never (and I mean never) been able to get full wi-fi coverage in each of the areas of my home. I got the Orbi to provide full coverage for my new AT&T Gigapower service in a home with at least 20 devices (PC's, macs, iPads, iPhones, PlayStations, XBoxes, Nest thermostats, automated sprinkler system, etc.) and kids that are pretty demanding of bandwidth. I was able to get it set up and working in about 5 minutes. I tuned off the wi-fi on my AT&T router/modem. I have tested every corner of the house as well as 20 ft or so outside my house, and the coverage is excellent as is the throughput on speed tests. So I am very pleased with the performance and ease of set up.\\n\\nThe one thing that caused me to ding it one star was the fact that I could not update the firmware on the satellite without calling tech support. They were extremely responsive and helpful however, and we got it updated in no time. Apparently, the initial release of the firmware has an issue that precludes the automated update, but once you get it manually updated (go to the IP address of the satellite, not the orbilogin.net page to upload the update that you'll download from the Netgear support site), supposedly, the automated updates will work from them on. Tech Support also showed me how to change the Orbi to Access Point mode so that all of my devices, including the ones connected to the ethernet ports of the AT&T modem, would all sit on the same network and be able to talk to each other. Once I made that change, my Plex server could communicate with my Playstation and all was good.\\n\\nI've spent a ton of money buying extenders to cover my house, but this thing makes them all obsolete (which is a good thing, since they did not provide a complete solution anyway). Plus, I now only see one SSID instead of different ones for different frequencies and extenders, and this is very nice. Don't hesitate to buy, but just remember how to update the firmware if you happen to get one of the initial releases.","[]","B01K4CZOBS","B0BT1BTW94","AF2YCBK6TTP6CRIHXJQIZ3MEN7UA","2017-01-05 18:10:03.000","1","False","506"

The built-in Envy screen was bright and clear (like a new iPad or iPhone) but the monitor was flat and dim.\\n\\nI struggled with the monitor for hours to get it bright and contrasty without losing detail. No luck. I'm tech-savvy and design/develop entertainment software so I was sure to Google the problem, use the right drivers and color space, and calibrate the screen. It was dim at 100% brightness, and if I turned up the contract above halfway, the light areas lost all detail and smooth gradients like skies began to show banding and posterization.\\n\\nLuckily, I was able to replace it quickly with best monitor I have tried (top-rated online), a Dell UltraSharp 24&#34;, for about the same price -- and it was a world of difference.\\n\\nViewing the 27sv is hard on my eyes and aesthetically unpleasing. As one other Amazon review said, I would recommend the 27sv for a gas station security camera monitor but not for the desktop.\\n\\nFYI, in case you think I am being too critical, you should know that I bought it for my wife, who is an accountant and is usually not as sensitive to picture quality as I am.

"100034","5","Perfect for my front porch!","I read countless reviews for a wireless battery-operated light before deciding on this one, and I wanted to post this because I read a few reviews where folks were looking to affix it to someplace outdoors.\\n\\nI wanted a little bit of light on the front porch because the light on the front porch is not motion activated.  I have returned home at night and struggled to see the lock to insert the key, and I have yet to remember to turn on the light prior to leaving.  I figured a little motion-activated light would solve the issue.  I didn't want TOO much light, but just SOME light that provided enough illumination to see where I am walking a few feet up to the door, and one that would stay on long enough to get in the house.  Finally, it needed to  be weather-proof.\\n\\nThis light has been great.  My husband affixed it to the ceiling just above the front door using silicone given the ceiling/roof has a metal underside.  The light is small enough that you don't actually enough notice it when you walk up to the front door, but even so, I didn't want it to be unattractive and I wanted to be able to take it down if we ever move.  While the silicone isn't a perfect beauty around the light, it serves its purpose and has worked out well.  It was hot and humid, and now it's in the 20s and 30s, and the light has continued to function without an issue and has stayed in place with the temperature changes.  Granted, rain is not hitting this area, so I cannot attest to that.\\n\\nThis light probably turns on about 9-12 feet when it senses motion and stays on for about 20-30 seconds, which is perfect.  Given its placement, neighbors are far enough away that they cannot activate the light, but sometimes the light does turn on, which I suppose is due to swaying leaves or branches, or an animal walking close by.  I also appreciate having this light because when we come back with the doggies, it illuminates the area quite nicely now that it gets darker earlier.  Although I feel completely safe in this area, this little light provides a tiny added measure of safety when walking up to a darker area, such as the front door.\\n\\nI am so glad that something like this is on the market!!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Hqa7DOhFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Hqa7DOhFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Hqa7DOhFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00196WS6S","B09X2J3LGX","AGA3JLYKVFE4VD3XWRJCO5G5VRYQ","2017-11-28 19:18:15.481","119","True","506"

"113628","2","the company gets credit for giving us action cams as we know it and this camera is amazing. Unfortunately there are some flaws","I am writing this review after 2 snorkeling trips and several mountain biking trips.  One one hand, the company gets credit for giving us action cams as we know it and this camera is amazing.  Unfortunately there are some flaws, so I need to write a less than stellar review.  As designed, I find only a few small faults with this camera and think that overall the camera and software do a great job.  The touch interface leaves a bit to be desired as too many things are buried in the menus.  I also think that a hardware screen lockout would be a great improvement as it is too easy to make unintended changes.  I have had other underwater cameras over the years and I was very excited to purchase this as my first GoPro.  There are tons of features and a huge secondary market for accessories.  I will warn you that the secondary market for batteries should be approached with caution as I have had poor experiences with one of the larger sellers of batteries for this model.  I will also note that you should be careful to not misplace your very short USB cable since it appears to be the only one that will work with the camera.  I have many other USB C cables and none worked correctly with the software, but allowed you to get to the camera files.  On to the issue:\\n\\nReliability\\n\\nIt was on the bus prepping the camera for a big day of snorkeling with my boys.  It was a perfect day and was the reason I had bought the camera and taken it along with a large bag of accessories halfway across the western hemisphere.  And the screen would not turn on.  I could still take pictures (1 star for innovation and 1 for still sorta functioning).\\n\\nI could have spent much less for an action camera, but felt it was good to get one for the original innovator and buy the best model they offered.  I will follow up with support and update the review with the outcome.\\n\\nPros:\\n-Innovative design\\n-Voice control\\n-No underwater housing needed for most applications\\n-Awesome video\\n\\nCons\\n-Unreliable\\n-Should include more than 1 frame\\n-Unusual hardware limitations, i.e.; must use their cable\\n-No hardware screen lockout","[]","B01M14ATO0","B079QPT28R","AGKQPWNNGBIYQ4S6HSR3ZLACY3NQ","2017-11-27 14:32:00.609","0","False","506"
"837835","5","It is 5 stars, definitely with severe power outage test","Update: I was away, we had a severe thunderstorm in the area, power was out. I monitor my house remotely and thought unless I was physically there, everything would be off. The TP-Link went back online, the Netgear didn't even respond. All the cameras, Z-wave house controls went back on with the TP-Link. I never had such luck with the previous Netgear. I strongly recommend this inexpensive and work great router.\\n\\nIt is a bit early for rating since I tested only for 1 day. I may come back and give 1 star if it is dead after 1 week. However, for the time being, if you are looking for basic, low-price (the emphasis is low-price), this one is hard to beat. I used to be a tad leery of second tier network equipment makers like TP Link, but the it improves and the product is getting to be quite decent. There are two features that aren't great, but one shouldn't complain for this price: 1- it is not very responsive to admin access. oo many times it gives a page to tp-link website because the http server part doesn't work. A bit frustrating that one has to turn on, off, or reset. Also, it doesn't allow more than 1 admin log in at a times. The problem is that it doesn't detect the admin log in is broken, hence should allow open another log in to reboot. 2- It doesn't have DHCP list for wired connection. This is a real problem for me as I use both wifi and Ethernet. I have to use other network software to find out the IP's of wired devices.\\n\\nOther than those two, for a minimum typical user, this one is perhaps as good as any in terms of bang for the buck. I purchased it only as a backup and an aggregate access point, but it impresses me enough to let it be the main wifi router and relegate the other router to be the access point.\\n\\nOne last thing about speed: I tested it side-by-side with a Netgear and a Linksys. As the other two are older models (1 year or more), I expected TP-link to be better with the newer 450 Mbs protocol. It is indeed proven better from 20% to 35% depending on location of my laptop within the house. So, again, it is a decent one.","[]","B003Y5RYNY","B09L52XKBD","AFKN6UCWPLY7UHZ7VWV36OCERMMQ","2017-08-12 17:51:11.376","31","True","506"
"320950","2","Giving new meaning to the word ""Premium""","I'm typically a big fan of Anker and think their products are both well designed and well built, however this speaker has left me less than satisfied.  I had the [[ASIN:B016XTADG2 Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker with 24-Hour Playtime, 66-Foot Bluetooth Range & Built-in Mic, Dual-Driver Portable Wireless Speaker with Low Harmonic Distortion and Superior Sound - Black]] prior to purchasing the &#34;Premium&#34; version, and I was way more satisfied with that speaker than I am with this one.  The sound is good, but very little else about it lives up to the word &#34;Premium&#34;.\\n\\nThe Premium Stereo speaker has probably 1/5 the battery life of the Soundcore, so I feel like I'm always charging it.  That's not the worst part of this speaker, however.  The thing that drives me absolutely nuts is the constant connect/disconnect chime this speaker makes any time the music is paused, such as when my phone is ringing, when I'm on the phone, or when I otherwise had to stop the music for any reason.  Instead of just sitting there quietly, this speaker constantly - and I mean like every 30 seconds at least - makes noise.  It can't just sit there waiting for the music to start playing again; it has to let you know again and again and again and it's annoying as hell.  Ding-dong...dong-ding!  ding-dong...dong-ding!...ding-dong!...dong-ding!\\n\\nFurthermore, let's say i'm listening to music while I'm in the shower and my phone rings.  When this happens, the music pauses while the phone rings, but by the time the phone has finished ringing the music doesn't just start playing again because this speaker has already broken the bluetooth connection to the phone and is now stuck in a cycle where it repeatedly makes its connect/disconnect chime until I can get out of the shower, reconnect the music, and start playing the music again.\\n\\nOverall this is a step back from the Soundcore and I can't recommend this speaker.  It makes a decent paperweight if you don't mind having your paperweight annoy you with constant chiming, otherwise pass this one up and purchase the Soundcore.","[]","B0107WH8Q4","B0107WH8Q4","AEYTJT6QMOHSEPLJDCTE5FK3ADZA","2017-04-20 16:25:53.000","7","True","506"
"334850","5","Best In Class - Great ""Entry-Level"" HiFi That Can Compete With $$$$ Units","First off, my MacBook Pro (2015) has a Cirrus 4208-CRZ and this has a Cirrus chip also. Some would say it's impossible that this would be an improvement - wrong. Laptops are pretty crammed internally and having an external DAC gets some of the noise out of the pathways. It's good. I mean, a well-implemented Sabre or Burr-Brown chip does sound better than this... But for the price, it's not worth it to look much further than the D30. It plays DSD/DSF (which I have very few of... and most of my friends don't care about) and handles plenty of inputs. At this point the only reason I would pay more is to get a unit with more input capabilities so I can totally by-pass my Harmon-Kardon's internal DAC (which is great, to be fair, but doesn't take USB and doesn't do DSD).\\n\\nWhat's great about it (especially as compared to a laptop or PC's internal DAC) is that my CD player (Sony DVP-S300) which already sounds great, can run to this via Coax and get a DAC upgrade. I can also run my PS3 through it... All without unplugging anything. I also highly appreciate that it is not an integrated amplifier - I have the Topping A30 for headphones, and a Harmon-Kardon AVR unit and a Yamaha 2-channel amplifier for amplification (theater and stereo, respectively). This means that I don't have to have a ton of redundancy in my components and the D30 will stay in my system longer. Excellent.\\n\\nThe sound out of this unit is clean, detailed, and doesn't add coloration as some units *can*. I appreciate the looks and size of the unit, and it really does sound *nearly* as good as some $1k-$4k DAC's I've had the pleasure to listen through. So, my advice is, unless you need to spend more money (???) then get the Topping and move your cash into nicer speakers and amplification.\\n\\nCons: Audirvana + (OSX) doesn't fully recognize it's DSD capabilities. Vox does. Some remote control functionality or information regarding current bitrate/bitdepth would be appreciated, but is not necessary. None of these are worth it losing a star over.","[]","B01L1SDKUQ","B01L1SDKUQ","AEOIXBAOSPFNQO3N2NBALVYYMYKA","2017-08-26 21:26:31.869","2","False","506"

"502800","1","Damaging and Worse than Original Manufacturer Pastes - Do NOT Buy!","I bought this Thermal Paste due to the very good reviews and performance shown by benchmarks from a store called Micro Center. I figured I would post a review on this website to let others who are also interested in this product know my experience with this product.\\n\\nProblem #1: The product performed worse than Antec's Diamond Formula Thermal Paste and most thermal paste provided on aftermarket water cooling systems (H110 and Seidon 120v tested on). I applied the thermal paste three different times on each cooler. Both i7-4790k and i5-7600k idled at 50C on the respective liquid coolers. Worse than the stock thermal pastes which yielded 40C idle and Antec's with 30-32C at idle.\\n\\nProblem #2: The product also performed worse on my MSI Apache Pro laptop. Idle temps with stock thermal grease idled 49-50C with only one of the two fans running. After putting the Mastergel Maker Nano paste, temperatures ranged as high as 55C to 65C at idle, passing 90C while playing only Minecraft.\\n\\nProblem #3: This product damaged my desktop's GPUs (2x Asus ROG Striker GTX760 4GB). The damage done to one GPU was bad (picture after cleaning 3 times with a 2-step Arctic Silver thermal grease cleaning kit and wiping down 2 times with 99% isopropyl alcohol). The damage done has not caused the GPU to be unsafe to use, but the temperature increase due to the damage is a 10-15C increase.\\n\\nProblem #4: A brand that I never considered purchasing (Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut specifically) outperformed Mastergel Maker Nano. I have not done tests on my desktop, but the temperature drops seen on my laptop was staggering. 35-40C idle with one fan, and 74C under heavy load with both fans active. While playing Minecraft, the temperatures stay around 63-64C while before, the laptop would pass 90C.\\n\\ntl;dr: CoolerMaster Mastergel Maker Nano performs very poorly and I do not recommend this product under any circumstances. If you are going to purchase a thermal paste to lower your temperatures, get Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (smaller tube by far, but enough to paste 1 desktop CPU, 2 GPUs, 1 laptop cpu, and 1 laptop gpu with a little leftover).","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814r+rzNSkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814r+rzNSkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814r+rzNSkL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B019BZENY8","B019BZENY8","AF47ZSBS6JJEXXML2DW765UBPG2A","2017-08-05 03:56:59.725","1","False","506"
"85010","5","Works great in my Loft space","While I have a lot of floor space and high ceilings, other factors made setting up a wall mounted or ceiling rigged pull down screen unrealistic or just cost prohibitive in my loft living space. I was also concerned about the negatives included in reviews for tripod or 'pull-up&quot; style screens. After a bit of research I decided the Yard Master 2 might be the perfect solution. Sold and shipped by Amazon I wasn't worried about having to return it if it didn't work out.\\n\\nThe screen arrived just a few days later. Handled properly this sets up so easily. The frame just unfolds and clicks into place with a precision that just made me grin with the beautiful simplicity of it. Follow the directions about which snaps to do first and the screen itself goes on without much struggle. The screen material is substantial, seems durable and has a solid feel to it. Once you've got the Yard Master 2 all set up (it takes about 10 minutes) it's abundantly obvious your money was very well spent.\\n\\nI found this fairly easy to move around on my own (I'm 6'2&quot; which helps a lot). It's light weight, and has some flexibility. Once in place it stands solidly upright on the detachable legs, and works out to be the perfect height for the short throw low table set up I'm using with my video projector (BenQ HT2050).\\n\\nThe screen arrived folded and is meant to be stored that way. I did observe the some wrinkles in the very center on the first night I had it up (not terribly distracting but evident). I left the screen set up overnight and by the next night it had smoothed out to the point where I was watching the opening of FARGO (the movie not the series) which starts out just stark white slowly fading into a snowy outdoor shot, and there were *no* wrinkles I could see.\\n\\nProperly packing the screen back up to minimize (or properly arrange) creasing is going to be this product's main issue IMO. The frame is very well made, but given the overall size and all the hinges and locking points you want to handle it carefully and make sure you have plenty of floor space for the set up. If I had available wall space I could easily imagine detaching the legs and mounting the frame right on the wall (if that was something you were thinking about).","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Ed-cpRQHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Ed-cpRQHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Ed-cpRQHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61RkrUNCx+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61RkrUNCx+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61RkrUNCx+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00MAPCZEM","B09PHG5NMY","AHI5GEECWDJVJ3LGU6OHVO5ZLVYA","2017-11-06 20:41:07.394","3","True","506"
"65694","1","I first I gave it a three for making the effort, but am down grading it to one","Update 09/29/18: I am revising my initial review down. I've used this charger exclusively for a little over a year and it has not held up as well as I expected. I wanted to use it a controled environment before I depended on it in a field situation. It looses its USB connection. At first I thought it was with the female plug slot (in a 360 electric power bar) but it is not, every other other cable I've used in either female slot has worked perfectly not a even a hic cup. This charger worked perfectly at first but now fails every time unless I wedge something to hold the male plug in place. The issue is in the Nitecore device. I am down grading it to one star, since every one of my cheapo chargers works perfectly and have for several years. It could be the usb cable is too short and too rigid making it difficult to use in all situations. It has to be twisted to plug into many powersources. it I add that readings from the Nitecore charger often did not correlate well with my other usb power meters.\\n\\nLets say there is room for improvement. There are a mass of chargers for camera batteries, most of them are garbage. Why no one has come out with a smart charger for camera batteries, I don't know. Most of them rely of idiot lights: amber, green, red or what ever changes to green, red or what ever. The user has no way to regulate the charge rate or even try to resurrect a dead battery. Proprietary camera batteries are usuriously expensive and  second party batteries are not always reliable. But I digress. This charger come close to a smart charger as any, but is poorly thought out. Although. It can charge two different batteries that means two different cameras that a use may or may not possess. Better to charge two of the same battery. Or modularize the charger between different batteries (better would be if camera makers could agree on standard (fat chance). I have one charger that will charge different camera batteries simply by moving the polarity pins.  The charge cable is too short. Nitecore should provide a cable, but let the user have the option of buying an off the shelf backup or replacement. Further Smarten up the unit a bit, let the user select the charge rate.\\n\\nStill however despite its limitations, this is an improvement over other chargers.","[]","B071DBBKCX","B071DBBKCX","AHALC4GTDED7LRQCAQBDI42R4KGQ","2017-08-11 22:50:19.685","3","True","506"

"768880","4","very happy with the purchase","Overall, very happy with the purchase.  My wife has some problems with hand tremors, and it helps to have a viewfinder instead of just the LCD screen so that she can hold it closer to the body and brace.  Plus having the auto stabilization on the main lens helps.  An SLR is a bit overkill here, but very few cameras now have that viewfinder unless you are up the price scale a ways, so decided to go this route after reading reviews.  And frankly, too small and light is actually not as stable for her, anyway.\\nAutofocus is fast and accurate, although a little care needs to be made to center the subject for the focus.  Found a few where the main subject was out of center, and one of the focus points caught something else.  With the camera in full program mode, it has still taken a number of excellent pictures just during testing, balancing focus and exposure well with depth of field.\\nHad purchased my last SLR (Minolta X700) from Ritz storefront about 25 years ago, and was just as happy with customer service this time.  Like some others have posted, ours actually had only a 16GB card instead of the second 32GB, and only one battery instead of two.  After sending Ritz an email, they shipped out the additional items the next day, and I received those within a week.\\nHave not had time to verify that everything functions correctly, yet - my wife left with the camera and basic lens and the table tripod for a vacation a couple of days after we got it.  We'll see how she did when she returns, and I'll test the remainder then.\\nThe only downside which I see at all is that the case is a bit small for all of the components.  That's really about it - as far as a kit goes, pretty inclusive.  And a well rated camera for someone not needing too many professional-level functions.  So far, I recommend it.\\nEdit - for those who did not receive the extra battery and the larger memory card - I contacted Ritz through Amazon and received a reply the next day.  I hope that this helps you - they literally sent the additional parts immediately with no questions.  I think that they realize that there is some mix up between the 4-lens kit and the 4-lens PREMIUM kit, which were the same price when I purchased.","[]","B01N3Q104E","B01N3Q104E","AGN3CQYR62Z6LA563LWMQ63JIRZA","2017-07-20 23:01:48.225","7","True","506"
"524255","4","Great, but not quite there","Let's get one thing straight, this is a great stylus, but I hope later iterations will refine it.\\n\\nThe charge time & battery life: Holy moly, this is ridiculously good. I expected nowhere near as long as a battery life and did not expect that I could get 0-100% in less than 15-30 minutes. I also go days without charging. I haven't had this good of an experience with battery life since my Kindle and my iPad Pro.\\n\\nResponsiveness: This is where this product kind of feels niche. I mostly use the pencil to write notes for class, which is great and all, but I wonder if I would have gotten the same experience if I had gotten the 53 pencil. A user has to use art or graphic design applications to really make use of the pressure sensitivity. It really does feel like a pencil under these conditions.\\n\\nBuild Quality: It feels like a pencil when writing, but it feels awkward to hold. The slim plastic profile is nice, but look at how other pencils are designed. Most use wood or metal for grip; plastic pencils usually have a non-cylindrical design or have some sort of grip to help with how smooth plastic can be. The weight of the pencil and the smooth plastic design can really make this pencil difficult to hold.\\nThe charging mechanism is odd, but it charges so quick and the lighting cable feels solid in the pencil. You would have to really push this thing for it to break in the IPad lightning port. The cap is also kind of funky; though magnetized, it feels weird that it just pops off and is not designed to stay attached. You could really lose that cap if one isn't careful.\\n\\nDesign with IPad: This less a shot at the pencil and more at Apple. There is no place to hold this in tandem with the IPad. A user needs a 3rd party item to hold the pencil in place without losing it. I have the Logitech create keyboard/case, which solves this issue with a simple sleeve, but this was a serious oversight by apple. For as on the go for an iPad is supposed to be, it feels odd that the pencil is just supposed to float in the ether, instead of attached to the ipad or keyboard.\\n\\nTLDR: Great stylus, needs refinement, but best stylus out there.","[]","B016NY7784","B0BJPSZ739","AHCIWYRYOKPQSU5R6MOWOENKR77A","2017-05-24 01:15:12.000","8","True","506"
"848501","5","Outstanding for small office; just beware cloud sync plans (expensive)","Very impressed with this. Used four Western Digital Red 4TB drives (why Amazon restricts purchase to 3 maximum I don't understand - especially since it's the bulk packaging?). Would definitely buy again or buy more for personal use (i.e. Plex server). At almost exactly a grand for the NAS + 4 drives, it's a very, very good deal. Note - this is the INTEL version which continues to support all of the &#34;apps&#34;. NETGEAR has removed this functionality on the lower-end ARM-based devices for some reason.\\n\\nSetup\\nSetup was a breeze - it defaulted to RAID 5 and I didn't want to mess with it (optimally wanted RAID 10). There are a ton of options we'll probably never use. Firmware update was quick and worked the first time (to version 6.9.0).\\n\\nIt runs pretty quiet, for what it is (a complex drive array with a whole computer in the box).\\n\\nManagement\\nManagement is a bit hybrid - the cloud management (ReadyCloud) is available from anywhere, but administration of the array is only available on the LAN (or via VPN). So be cognizant of this if you want - or need - to do actual device management  beyond file management. It can update firmware (in our case, to 6.9.1) remotely, but I'm cautious to mess with it if something goes awry.\\n\\nThe multiple usernames are a bit awkward (one for local administration; one for the ReadyCloud).\\n\\nOnline Sync Services\\nCurrently using one-way OneDrive sync. Note comment on one-way - we have proprietary files and don't have any need to access the raw files remotely (yet). Actually we'd even prefer to not do so as to enforce security.\\n\\nWanted to go with Egnyte, but their pricing for StorageSync *mandates* the Business tier and 25 (minimum) accounts. This is not trivial for a small office (almost five thousand). For that much - and five employees - I could basically buy out an Amazon S3 configuration which blows the doors off of Egnyte.\\n\\nWe might go to Dropbox eventually, especially since OneDrive &#34;beta&#34; is flaky.","[]","B01KJ58F4S","B01KJ58F4S","AEJFDUZF4MTQ7DCU3EPWVS3PUCWA","2017-12-02 22:37:59.416","0","False","506"
"947269","2","SO disappointing compared to my 4th Gen. Kindle Fire HDX 8.9; RETURNING.","I am so disappointed in this that I am going to pay more to have my 2+ year old Kindle repaired than it costs to buy this one new.  I have the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 (4th Gen).  Sadly, I dropped it face-down onto a tile floor, shattering the screen. I ordered this one as a replacement, which is the fastest and largest available of the current models.  Once I got it up and running, I immediately noticed how slow it is while browsing web pages. The simple act of loading a web page is painfully slow.  Furthermore, the display is lower resolution, as is the camera. Battery life is 33% lower. Another thing I noticed is that I couldn't highlight text to cut and paste where I could before with my old Kindle. Worse all around.  I've only used it for a day or two, so I'm sure if I keep using it, I'll notice more bugs. (Update 2-27-2017:  It freezes a lot). The only improvement is the fact that the storage capacity is expandable via an easily inserted SD card.  I checked the specs and compared it to my 2+ year old Kindle and am just dumbfounded as to why instead of improving on the Kindle, amazon has significantly downgraded their Kindle offerings. Comparison follows:\\n\\n***Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 (4th Gen)***\\n2.5 GHz Quad Core processor\\n8.9&#34; display with over 4 million pixels (339 ppi / 2560 x 1600)\\n8 MP rear-facing camera and front-facing 720p HD camera\\n2 GB RAM\\nBattery Life:  12 hours mixed use\\nWeight:  13.2 oz.

"886110","5","Nice camera great price point","UPDATE:  Camera has been running outdoors now for 30 days.  Sharp clear picture, Excellent night vision.  Other than a plastic housing and mounting plate this has been excellent camera at an affordable price.\\n\\nUPDATE:  Camera has been up and running for 3 weeks.  Picture quality is good.  Digital zoom is fair.  When zooming out picture quality becomes poor quickly which makes ID of persons even within 20 ft difficult. Lacks some of the internal settings found in more expensive Hikvision and LaView cameras which more than twice expensive. (No VCA Line Cross etc)  Motion detection is good however setting sensitivity is tricky and clouds, sun flashes etc. will activate camera.  Note: other more expensive cameras have same problem when outside.  Again weakest part is the poor quality set screws used for adjusting camera position.\\n\\nI received this camera to provide an unbiased review. I am NOT  tech guy so my observations are for those with a system and ease of setup.\\n\\nI am running my cams through an NVR  (Laview)\\nPro:  I plugged in the POE cable from the NVR and in less than a minute the camera was up and running!  So out of the box good to go  connected to an NVR system.\\n  Nice clear picture night vision was acceptable out to around 30 ft.  (I live in a very rural area so no street lights etc.)\\n\\nCon:  The mounting is plastic and requires a screwdriver to adjust.  If not careful it would be easy to strip the screw or break the mount.\\n  Setup was a breeze but not as easy when going directly to a router.  I did get it to come up but took some hunting to find the IP and getting it\\n  to load the image.\\nI did not try to setup through the router through port forwarding so was independent from the NVR\\n\\nFor the money this is a decent camera.  It is light weight and in most situations would be acceptable.  In extreme weather conditions more expensive metal cased and mount cameras are in my opinion better.  When so many cameras out there at $200+ this makes it easier to add additional cameras to your existing system.\\n\\nI received this camera at a discounted price and agreed to submit an unbiased review.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81R5tjaByYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81R5tjaByYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81R5tjaByYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B06XHYKP53","B06XHYKP53","AHLSZEWQRRHOG5DA7BCXURSJTBTA","2017-04-05 23:18:16.000","1","False","506"
"926350","5","Updated review... still 5 stars!","I guess I am one of the lucky buyers (so far) and got the latest version with the updated firmware, as I have not experienced any of the issues other reviewers have had. I took a big chance after reading the reviews, but after spending some serious time researching various 1080p gaming monitors, this one fit the bill for features, price, and use for my PS4 Pro and PC. My old monitor was the time-tested gaming beast Asus VG248QE, so the only upgrade I was looking for was to move up to a 27&#34; screen size (my personal limit for a 1080p screen), and of course staying with a 144hz refresh rate. It was a tough decision between another Asus and the newer ultra wide monitors; however, the Samsung Quantum Dot feature, with a 144hz/1ms VA panel is what sealed the deal for me. The colors on this monitor are AMAZING with no need for calibration, the curve is immersive (27&#34; model), no dead/stuck pixels, no noticeable input lag (and I game competitively), and quality stand design are all reasons why I love this monitor. Sure, the monitor does not have the gimmicky cross hairs for gaming, but I never use those anyway.\\n\\nThe set up was a bit tricky though as my PC would not recognize the plug/play as a 144hz monitor (Windows 10 64). I downloaded the drivers from Samsung, unplugged the power cords from my PC and monitor, plugged everything back, and then my monitor finally showed up as a Samsung monitor and was able to select the 144hz option, and enable Freesync on my Radeon RX580 gpu.\\n\\nThere are other cheaper 1080p 27&#34; gaming monitors (including the Acer ED273); however, this model fits it's niche nicely! It's not for everyone, but considering how many hours I game, I was willing to fork over a few extra dollars for something I want. I am very happy with my purchase and look forward to many hours gaming on this monitor!\\n\\nUpdate: I recently started having some issues where I could not get my monitor to recognize my pc after turning the monitor back on (I rarely turn off my PC, just my monitor). I bought a high end DisplayPort cable and it works fine now; even the colors look better! I'd suggest picking up a new cable asap!","[]","B01M1D75E3","B01MA2B2KU","AGB6FDCEBZ6L7YKAU32FWHP2NS5Q","2017-11-20 16:08:34.862","1","True","506"
"949011","5","Highly recommend","The Galaxy Book is awesome. I had a Microsoft Pro for comparison and the Book beats it. Not only in weight and screen, but also in the fact that the Case comes with along with the Pen. The case provides more coverage for the tablet than just the keyboard. Both are very light weight and easy to carry around. The pen is made to fit easy between the fingers with one flat edge to prevent rolling away. The back end cover is magnetized which I love so that when you fold it to stand the tablet up it wont slip and cause the tablet to fall. The System is pretty smooth as well and easy to sync to my Microsoft Windows account. There was no additional installation of apps or anything like that. I am able to do multiple projects at once without it freezing on me with the 128GB drive.\\n\\nI have a Samsung S7 edge and the both pair with eachother to allow you to answer phone, and text messages as well as do any updates to your phone without having to pull it out. Everything done from the Galaxy Book. I must admit it was a hassle to get the two to sync and actually do what it is suppose to, but once I did it was awesome. I have a desk job and it is nice to be able to answer message though the Book than my phone so that it does not give me a bad image of not working. :)\\n\\nI really love the keyboard, unlike the Microsoft Pro, the Galaxy Book keyboard is not fabric material. It is a hard plastic which makes it easy to clean. There is also more space between the keys so that one with bigger fingers need not worry about pressing 3 different letters at once.\\n\\nThe one down side to this product is that it does NOT have a USB port so you will have to buy new connectors if you have another monitor that is used or if you need to save anything to to an external drive. You will also have to buy a new mouse. The power cable is the same as the new Samsung Galaxy 8 phone (more oval) so anything cord prior will not work to charge the device. Plus is that it does come with a fast charger and works great!.\\n\\nI do highly recommend this Samsung Galaxy Book  if you enjoy the ease of a Tablet and the work ethic of a computer. It is easy to pack and go and with a fast charger you do not have to worry about waiting all day to charge.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/418M471IC2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/418M471IC2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/418M471IC2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51U4KuLqn4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51U4KuLqn4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51U4KuLqn4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ptdEUq-4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ptdEUq-4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ptdEUq-4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vhtKfVCNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vhtKfVCNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vhtKfVCNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LdR6dhWQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LdR6dhWQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LdR6dhWQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B06XF2LCMT","B06ZYSY8MF","AGVZLY35AGK3OWZU5EEGMIHQQTZQ","2017-07-27 17:23:26.214","1","False","506"
"682619","5","Great Product, Even Better Customer Service","I am sadly really tough on my phones, and LifeProof cases have been JUST what I need to keep them protected.\\n\\nLast May I bought a LifeProof case and it protected my phone amazingly well. Because I'm so tough (I'm a country/farm girl, and go caving, etc....), the LifeProof case only generally lasts about a year before it's too banged up and falling apart to do much good. Thankfully LifeProof (at least the case I bought) comes with a year-long warranty.\\n\\nA few weeks ago I requested a replacement case to go along with the warranty, and the processes was incredibly simple. It wasn't long before a new case arrived in my mail box. The only problem was is they sent me the wrong size. I contacted the company again, thanking them for their prompt service, and letting them know about the problem. I also told them that I was leaving the country in about a week, and *really* needed the new case before then.\\n\\nThe customer service was amazing! Not only did the rush a second (correctly sized) case out so I could get it before I left the country, but they also told me I could keep the previous case they'd sent me, and pass it along to someone in need. That kind of customer service makes this product so much more important to me.\\n\\nAs for the case itself, my only quibble with it would be 1) That it doesn't last longer (but again, I think that's my fault for being so rough on it), and 2) That at the about 9 or so month mark, the part of the case covering the camera lens was so scratched and cloudy I couldn't really take pictures any more with the case on. But again! These are minor, minor things when considering that the case has protected my phone multiple, multiple times.\\n\\nI didn't have a LifeProof case for my first iPhone, and the phone only lasted a little over two years - with the last months me literally taping the phone together because it was in three different parts, with only a few wires holding it together. I've now had my current phone (which has always had a LifeProof case) for two and a half years, and it still looks practically new.\\n\\nThank you, LifeProof, for your product and AMAZING customer service!","[]","B00Z7SZPI2","B00Z7SZPI2","AFHFK72MRHHWRWU2JITES4P5LYLQ","2017-05-12 18:28:35.000","4","True","506"
"201304","5","Best little unit","Best little unit! My father has the original which, for him is great. I waited almost a year before investing in this little baby and having the option to pay $10.00 a month was a no brainer. I was not fond of the full sound that comes from the unit BUT that is the trade off when buying into a portable sound item (keep in mind that you have to have the DOT plugged in unless you use another power source like, an extended battery/charger which, I may look into. Soooo, I bought the Oontz Angle 3 Plus Bluetooth speaker WHICH some reviews claim it not so great however, I can tell you that it absolutely made all the difference for my needs. I come home from work and ask Alexa to play whatever genre I am in the mood to listen to INSTEAD of turning my TV on AND, I will tell you that I LOVE to watch my flicks but somehow this little DOT forces me to out my head into a place of less &#34;noise&#34;. I choose to filter what is more important to me as, you should. Is the DOT perfect? is Alexa perfect? No, I ask Alexa questions like, &#34;when were humans first created?&#34;, she cannot respond but ask her what the SUN is made up of or if there is a chance that life on MARS is possible and she will give you an answer. When you wake up, you can say, &#34;Alexa, Good Morning and she will respond. On April 1st, Fools Day, I said, &#34;Alexa, Goodnight&#34; and her response was, &#34;Good night and don't forget to fool someone before the day is over&#34;, pretty smart technology. Do I plan on buying more, yes I do. Give it try but DO buy a separate portable speaker for an enhanced experience.\\n\\nUpdate: I just purchased my 2nd Dot and with my Amazon Prime account, I got it in 2 days! I simply love these Dots; well worth the cost as it pays for itself between my audible books, heart Radio and Pandora accounts. I have one in my living room and the other in my bedroom - great alternative to having the TV on and, I love to watch my movies but to chill out with the Dot to decompress from your day, you cannot go wrong!!","[]","B01DFKC2SO","B01K8B8YA8","AEZWE3FLTZABB2G5ET4LZJCCEZNA","2017-04-04 01:31:22.000","2","True","506"
"667320","5","SD Card option so CONVENIENT!! Very Good sound for the price!","I'd purchased this &#34;stereo&#34; speaker primarily because of the available option to play my music via the SD card slot. Less hassle not having to use my phone. As luck would have it the unit that I received was defective in that one option. It would not play via the SD card. I e-mailed their tech support and received a reply within an hour. I tried several different size SD cards formatted with FAT & FAT32 and trying a specific song they had me download the SD card still would not work. It worked fine via bluetooth and even the AUX connection. So all within a couple of hours of e-mail exchanges they determined it was defective (hey, it happens) and immediately shipped me out a replacement. Couple days later I received the replacement and the SD card in this one worked fine. THANKS to Milla for the great tech support!!! Ok, after using the speaker I can highly recommend it! It has very good sound for the price. I wish I had this when I still worked and had a small AM/FM/CD radio to listen to. For it's size it's got some hefty weight to it. The controls are &#34;BRIGHTLY&#34; illuminated and responsive. It has 4 rubber feet on the base that if it's placed on a smooth surface it will practically stick in place and not slide should you push it. It can play very loud and in my use the loudest for my liking is half volume. It comes with a water proof drawstring pouch for storage/carrying, both an AUX cable and cable for USB charging either via PC or phone charger. I am currently playing it at my desk as I write this review where I used to play music thru my PC. Using the SD card for music, when you shut off the speaker it remembers where you left off in the cue or mid song next time you turn it back on. If you like the convenience having the SD card & not dealing with your phone/tablet via bluetooth this is soooo convenient. Edit: Someone asked this so FYI songs play by title alphabetically from the card. I'd never even noticed and assumed it was random until I checked to respond to the question. As for the option to answer your phone with this I haven't tested it and quite frankly can't see using it if you're among others like an outdoor barbecue or the beach where all can hear your conversation.","[]","B01MSTES8C","B08YF1VBYD","AHPSAEKPLPDIUEKLGQ7653CFANYQ","2017-06-16 16:21:17.773","444","True","506"

"676741","1","Updated 2017-10-07: Does what needs to be done, but slowly and with a new power supply.","Updated 2017-10-07:\\nTwo of the three RAID enclosures have caused me to lose ALL the data put on them.  This means a total loss of around 23TB!  It took me days to fix what was lost, thus loss of one star.\\n\\nOther notes: The eSATA port is WAY faster on this thing than the USB 3.0 port, by almost double.  I happened to have a USB 3.0-to-eSATA cable and this enclosure flies with it.  Unfortunately, this type of setup adds to the cost by $25, so loss of another star.\\n\\nOriginal Review\\nI bought this as a cheap RAID array, and that is pretty much all you get.  This dock has two glaring issues:\\n\\n1. Slow over USB 3.0.  I tried transferring a 4TB file to 4x8TB WD Red drives and the maximum speed the dock allowed was 55MB/s according to Windows 8.1.  The 4TB file was being transferred from a Samsung 850 EVO 4TB housed in the fasted external enclosure I have ever tested.  The bottleneck was clearly this dock.  It took 20 hours to transfer the 4TB file.\\n\\n2. Not enough power.  The included power supply did not supply enough power to start 4x8TB WD Red drives.  The dock's included power supply is only rated for 12v at 5A.  When 4x8TB WD Reds start spinning up, the dock quickly flashes an error and reboots, then cycles like this until shut off using the power switch.  To get around this, you can start the dock with only 3x4TB WD Reds, then insert the 4th drive.  Not an ideal solution.  Or, you can use a more powerful power supply.  I had a 12v at 6A power supply laying around and it worked for startup of the dock and the RAID drives with no issues.\\n\\nOther notes:\\n\\nThe dock is made of plastic and feels cheap.  It comes with very thin rubber feet on the bottom which do little when you fully load the dock with 3.5&#34; HDDs.  The design also allows the dock HDDs to be exposed and unprotected, so I would only use this for noncritical functions.","[]","B01J4ICS2G","B01J4ICS2G","AHXO6T77JZSJLUQYKY2F3W46PMSQ","2017-09-10 15:42:57.887","6","True","506"
"906989","4","Decent, but not perfect","This device does the job of switching between inputs to a single output device quite well.  I use it to allow two computers to use the same monitor, and I also use the audio channel of HDMI through the monitor's output, so it is doing the job of switching the full channel capacity of the HDMI standard.  The switch is quick and stable so far, which is what I would expect.  I have not noticed any lines or artifacts in the displayed picture, nor have I noticed any issues in audio quality.  I am using a 2560 x 1440 monitor, which is resolution higher than HD (1920 x 1080), but lower than 4K (3840 x 2160.)  This device is advertised to handle all the way up to and including 4K resolutions and 3D, which usually is delivered at up to 120 frames per second.  I am running at 60 frames per second, the US standard rate for 2D computer video.\\n\\nMy one complaint is that the picture-in-picture feature is essentially useless, at least as I have seen with computer monitor data.  The PIP function just displays a tiny thumbnail &#34;image&#34; that doesn't look even remotely like what is coming in on the non-active video channel.  It will show either a plain white rectangle, or one with some extremely vague distortion of the video data that never changes at all.  It is a picture in a picture, yes, and you can switch inputs from the PIP function, but the sub-picture displayed is not anything remotely like the active signal of the non-displayed channel, and it doesn't animate either.  I have not tried with signal inputs from other types of video devices.\\n\\nI can probably live with the useless PIP feature because the device does to the intended switching well so far, and PIP is more of a cute gimmick than a serious need for me.  I'm not sure that a tiny rendition of a high-resolution computer screen would be all that helpful anyway, and this device does not have any way to adjust the size of the PIP preview either, so unless they make the PIP feature more sophisticated, I don't see it as anything that is make-or-break.  I have just largely written it off as one of those &#34;features&#34; that is more for advertising than serious use.  Not a deal breaker for me though.","[]","B01BV1XBHK","B01BV1XBHK","AHYBKYPUGY4WEKDRGKJ5DG7U75WA","2017-11-22 13:29:57.022","0","True","506"

It should be auto configured (mine was on my Gigabyte board), but double check anyway. Especially that it reads 2.0.\\n\\nWith that, install really is a breeze - Just install, start the PC, enter the BIOS and configure if necessary.  BIOS configuring is basically making sure the BIOS sees the module and that it is configured as a 2.0 device. Restart the PC, and Windows should see it. You may need an additional reboot as Windows finishes installing drivers, but that’s it.\\n\\nNow go to Control Panel, choose BitLocker, read and follow the instructions, to include saving your TPM key. Note, the key can’t be saved to a drive that’s being encrypted. Best to use a thumb drive.  Or, you can have it saved to your MS account.  Click next to encrypt the drive. As noted, encryption times vary, even between OS’s and thus this isn’t going to be a 10-minute job, especially if you’ve got a large drive with lots of data. Again, my drive took just under 2 hours, but that’s a 512gig SSD drive just 28 percent filled.\\n\\nOh, and you can still use your PC while the drive is encrypting, but I wouldn’t do anything intensive. During my encryption window, I was able to browse the net and write a few Word docs no issue.\\n\\nI’ll rate this item 5, but really it either works or it doesn’t. And configuring is on the PC side. So again, it either works or it doesn’t.","[]","B01G97X6T4","B01G97X6T4","AH6J3L4WCOYFOISWB3KDVIWABSHQ","2017-03-03 03:07:59.000","3","True","506"
"371819","5","This is a great product. I don't say this lightly.","I, very rarely, give a product a 5 star review. This is the exception. I was skeptical reading the other reviews - which were pretty good. I just returned the Logitech Harmony Ultimate - a nice product, but I spend 3 days trying to get it set up in a somewhat complex way, spend call after call with tech support - and it was not consistent in performance. It would lose the 'hub', commands would sometimes work, other times not - indicating to me it was a 'delay' problem with how quick the commands were sent to the receiving device - whatever the case, I was literally exhausted trying so many different things. So, I decided to try this Inteset remote. Gotta say, programming was easy, worked like a (almost) champ. The only issue I had, and I can't plane the device for this, is that it did not control my Fire Stick TV - which I really wanted. One button HBO, Showtime, FireTV, YouTube - the possibilities were there, but the Fire Stick used Bluetooth, not IR - (darn!!)... You need to know you will set up your devices, up to 4, on keys A,B,C,D and the codes for my devices worked fine (Sony TV, Bose Solo Speaker, Channel Master OTA DVR+, and Sony DVD player. NOTE: Read the instructions about setting a Master Volume and Channel - this will save you time - it allows one button (A-D) to be the Master for Volume changes and Channel changes. So I used the BOSE for the volume and the Channel Master for Channel - worked great. I wrote Tech support with a few questions and Jim responded in a few hours. I did not see a phone number to call - which was disappointing, but the response was quick. I've only had the remote a 2 days, so I may find something it won't do (other than control Bluetooth - which it's not meant to do) but so far, it's great and does what the instructions say it will. Oh, the Logitech cost's $140, this one much less. I saved a bit of money and will have to live with 2 remotes max, and one most of the time.\\n\\nThis also works my IR blinds that are 14' up covering windows. Learned the IR code from the blind remote, assigned to a key, done. I was able to get rid of another remote too! Nice.","[]","B00M4I1BAY","B00M4I1BAY","AH6LKWPBCDE56W5J5AN53323QJDA","2017-11-13 23:39:55.835","5","True","506"
"643516","5","HyperDrive Hype is Real!!!","I have been following this company since their Kickstarter days and have watched the improvement of many products. Even though some purchasers have complained about faulty hubs, I have not had any issues with mine while using it for a few days. The company has made updates on the product and I can say it has none of the past issues people have commented about whatsoever.\\n\\nWhen I saw that the HyperDrive was introduced on Amazon, I knew I had to get my hands on one for my 2017 Macbook Pro with Touchbar. Since the change from USB-A to the new USB-C connections every charging cable and connector I had were obsolete. I had tried various dongles and adaptors which had been very annoying to carry around and connect. I did purchase the “Nonda USB-C to 3.0 Adaptor” and it worked very well but I needed more than just one port for other connections to my laptop. I have my iPad attached as a second screen to my Macbook and once that is connected its one port less where I need to attach my external hard drive and charge my laptop etc. Having to buy different adaptors for each software was not very convenient. This product was able to incorporate all different ports which are not offered in the new generation of laptops.\\n\\nWhen looking around to purchase one of these hubs I saw the Apple Hub and it was not sleek in design, just a white dongle which hangs off your laptop with limited adaptors (only 3 ports). This however is sleek/professional looking and matches the color of your device. It sits flush via two USB-C ports to give you fast optimal speed. I was able to connect SD cards which I could not do previously and an HDMI cable which is hard to find in the hubs sold on Amazon. No other product incorporates so many types of adaptors like the HyperDrive, it truly is a game changer for those who have a lot of devices hooked up to their laptop. I love that it is so compact and you can put it anywhere in your backpack/purse.\\n\\nI truly recommend this to anyone looking to be able to connect all their devices including TV, iPad/iPod/IPhone, hard drive, SD card, camera, etc. to their new 2016/2017 MacBook Pro with only USB-C ports.\\n\\n*I will be updating this review shortly with photos and any updates I come across.*","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZO9M+vh8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZO9M+vh8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZO9M+vh8L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ULD0tQnDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ULD0tQnDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ULD0tQnDL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01MUAEI7J","B01MUAEI7J","AH6JQYLTH3RTB56PZG6KRJCLLLMQ","2017-10-01 02:32:53.999","9","True","506"
"859690","4","It's pretty good, but for the price of the 75"" ...","It's pretty good, but for the price of the 75&#34; model, I was expecting more. After getting a taste for 4K and recognizing the shortcomings of the current LED technology, I'm downgrading to a LG 65&#34; OLED 4K TV (which happens to be more expensive due to its using of OLEDs).\\n\\nAside from backlight bleeding (which is what caused me to give my previous-generation TV to a friend), everything about this TV was immaculate. The user interface worked fantastically, the HDR, 3D, 4K, and HDCP 2.2 all proved to be no issues. That said, I heeded some online warnings and connected my PS4 pro directly to the TV, then used optical return audio to run the sound through my receiver.\\n\\nWebOS is truly a pleasure to use, after having seen the progress of smart TVs over the past few years I'm honestly no longer pessimistic about their futures. LG has clearly spent a lot of time soliciting user feedback and making a thing that people actually want, and it shows. It has all my favorite apps (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Plex). Everything works butter-smooth, including 4k content.\\n\\nPS4 immediately recognized the TV's capability and upgraded a few of my games to next-gen graphics (dolby vision AKA UHDR) and 2160p. I gotta say I like the old PS4 better than the new one on the outside, but on the inside it's an entirely different story.\\n\\nIn short, if you're not a gamer or a critical viewer of low-light scenes, this TV is incredible. However, the backlight bleeding proved too much for me to stomach after dropping nearly four thousand dollars into this TV after taxes. I'll take a slightly smaller surface area with &#34;true&#34; blacks going forward. But I'll remain an LG customer, as they've proved they're committed to providing consumers with high-quality products at competitive pricing. Most importantly, everything &#34;just works&#34;. 3D output automatically switches to 3D (and back), HDR and 4k work flawlessly with the HDMI cable included in the PS4 box (HDMI 2.0a I imagine), and this TV is everything I could want in a TV -- except for black levels.","[]","B01C9CYH1E","B01C9CYH1E","AGNJ5XTP6MU5P4IKXN7OYHUU7WNQ","2017-01-22 11:53:48.000","17","True","506"
"58725","3","The bass is muddy and not really there. Had to spend more to get a real subwoofer.","I bought this sound bar since many websites were praising how great the sound was and how it had built in subwoofers that help make the sound deeper and richer as compared to other sound bars without one. I got better overall sound from my  $65 z506 Logitech speakers when it came to movies, video games, and music from my PC due to a decent setup and a dedicated subwoofer. Now when listening to classical music which mostly had middles and highs I honestly got tears because of how amazing the sound felt after a few settings change, it honestly felt like someone was in the room playing the most beautiful music, watching movies and playing video games on my PC fell flat with no real depth or clarity due to the lack of a real subwoofer no matter the settings.\\n\\nWhen I use the default stereo with no modifications to the sub settings or filters the sounds are shallow and like if they were coming from some cheap speakers, by default the z506 sounded deep and rich with no settings required.\\n\\nWhen using stereo mode and increasing the bass you get more sound but very negligible and pretty useless, the highs and middles sound more muddy now. Using the bass extension does deepen the sounds but now sounds very muddy and you don't good highs or middle or lows now, just sounds like a boomy mess.\\n\\nUsing surround DTX after the update with no bass extension the front channels (voices)  sound way louder and there's more sound that actually feels like you are surrounded by to a degree but nothing amazing.  You do get more bass compared to stereo but sounds have a small echo If you pay close enough attention.\\n\\nUsing DTX plus bass extension gives you more of the theater deep bass but again the sounds are muddy and I had to lower the bass volume to make the overall sound be more balanced but still had some depth.\\n\\nI'm not a person who enjoys thumping bass that destroys the overall music or movie sounds but I was very underwhelmed by the sub woofer on this bar and the overall default sound. I will buy a sub woofer and see how the middles and highs blend with the new sub now that they won't be muddled by the on bar subs.\\n\\nI have bought the Polk Psw-10 after the many reviews and 5 stars and will update this review when some tests and tweaking are done.","[]","B071ZN5PSS","B071ZN5PSS","AGBDXR5E4E5BZOOCX3ABSXPCC5HA","2017-11-10 22:59:33.635","20","True","506"
"743779","5","Third purchase of this excellent power supply","I have 25 CCTV cameras around the house,  Rather than using the individual &#34;wall wart&#34; type of power supply they come with, I used a centralized supply in my attic.  I burned through two of the cheaper Chinese knock-offs of this power supply in under two years, so decided to spend a little more for this original one.  I wrote a five-star review for my original purchase of this product (about 18 months ago), and it's still going strong.\\n\\nI recently added 14 powered blinds and some irrigation controllers, and again, rather than using their wall wart supplies, I bought another of these 29A Mean Well supplies, and it's working well.  These supplies use much better quality components throughout than the knock-offs.  (Don't waste your time/money on the knock-offs.)\\n\\nUpdate 07/09/20: And now I've purchased a third of the same.  The first two continue to work flawlessly, despite them being subjected to my typical 110F attic temperature.  One of these 350W supplies is plenty enough to power all of my cams and blinds at the same time but I need three only 'coz I want different 120V inputs feeding each of them:\\n\\n1. For my 11 outdoor security cams, with the 120V input coming from my UPS so they'll continue to work during a power outage.\\n\\n2. A second to power my blinds and irrigation stuff, with the 120V coming from the usual mains (no UPS required, and I don't want to drain the UPS battery unnecessarily).\\n\\n3. And a third for my 5 indoor security cams, also powered from the UPS but through a Vera Z-Wave controlled outlet that I use to turn off the power for indoor camera privacy when home, and power on when away.  I was originally using five separate 12V wall-warts on a power bar for this purpose but, as I'm tidying up my equipment in the attic, decided to splurge for another of these Mean Well supplies.\\n\\nAnyway, this is just an update to say that I'm still happy with my first two, so ordered the third.  It was just delivered moments ago, so I'll add the power cord and head up to the attic to make use of it.","[]","B007K2H0GI","B08JD8BMDC","AGLFSXRZP2JE6DSBY6Z7AVZVA2VA","2017-05-08 12:51:51.000","7","True","506"
"986804","5","I'm a Bose man so this was quite a stretch...","I picked this bad boy up at Target for 49.99 and thought I'd give it a try. As with all my audio equipment (not an audiofile...well...err maybe an amateur) I always like to give all equipment a fair shake. Therefore before I review I review I always give the audio equipment a full break-in whether or not it calls for it.\\n\\nLike I previously stated, I prefer Bose, not because they are the best but rather, their products are ready to go at an affordable price rather than say Shure, Hardin Kardon, Audio Technica, etc. with that said Inam super impressed with the sound of this little device.\\n\\nBeing only one speaker the sound is great. Since I put my equipment through audio break in I did not get the tinny sound or (bass) crackle at max volume. The mids are decent (though the IE Roll 2 has better mid-range) and not super full of bass but enough to get the job done.\\n\\nRemember, people often ask me, &#34;I want the best sounding speaker with good bass, good miss, etc.&#34; this my friend doesn't exist. It's mostly user preference. I do like the sound of the Clip and have been using it over my Bose soundlink.\\n\\nI love the portability and I did throw it in the pool for around 5-7 minutes with no issues. Would be nice if it was fully waterproof and it would sit on top of the water but can have it all. Carabiner clip is good and the silicon seems to hold well and is stiff.\\n\\nAs for the range I got about 35-49 feet in a split level townhome. The pros and cons:\\n\\nPros:\\n-Great sound\\n-decent bass\\n-treble is good\\n-portability is awesome\\n-water proof, yes please :)\\n-connection and range is awesome\\n\\nCons:\\n-don't expect 200$ audio quality\\n-only one speaker\\n-no deep bass (duh)\\n\\nAll in all great sound at a decent price.

"113808","5","Get it..... get it 2 times.","Double the price of the uv-5r.... and worth it.  The biggest winning feature on this radio is scanning a RANGE of frequencies, not just frequencies you program yourself.  So press *scan button for 2 seconds and punch in 144 and 148 and you're scanning the entire 2 meter band.  420 and 450 and you're scanning the entire 70cm band.  This is huge for someone who just wants to hear what's out there without referencing and entering single frequencies.\\nBuy the programming cable and download chirp to put in channels.  Massive time saver.  Getting the cable to work is a bear, plenty of videos to walk you through it.\\nIt DOES have a &#34;normal' FM radio feature, just push the orange button above the PTT and listen to FM radio music.  I was hesitant to do this because the button says &#34;call&#34;, and I did not want to transmit until I get a license, but it works and does not transmit anything.\\nI bought the 5r, 5r5, 82wp, and this 5x3.  Happy with all of them, but the scanning on 5x3 gets it turned on more than the others.  The same programming cable works for all except the 82wp.\\nI programmed all the radios with GMRS channels, which I do have a license for, and all worked well.  I recommend that you program FRS channels to check transmit and receive functions.  And definitely buy 2 of these, or one of these and a uv-5r.  That way you can check radio functionality and start practicing communications.\\nCHIRP will automatically program NOAA, FRS/GMRS, Marine VHF, MURS, and much more.  With 10 mouse clicks I had 100 channels with offsets programmed!\\nI do not have a HAM license(test in 24 days), so I cannot comment on that use, other than that it receives well.  I can listen to Fire dispatch tone out stations and I live 17 miles out of town.  This will not pick up communications from Fire or Police communications because they are on an 800Mhz trunked system, but Dispatch is 154.965 for Fire in Travis County, Texas.  So this works fine for picking that up.  Check your local frequencies to make sure your radio choice is the right one for you.","[]","B01J2W4JUI","B01J2W4JUI","AGYVRK67QDPBFCTDI5FXR2FLHDCQ","2017-03-07 03:49:59.000","9","True","506"
"316574","4","H.ear on: A less expensive alternative to the Bose QC35","Bluetooth technology has come pretty far in the past decade. Wireless headphones in particular have also come pretty far, and the argument that the sound quality of wireless headphones is not as good is becoming less and less valid. I didn't realize how convenient it was not to have to deal with wires until I had these headphones.\\n\\nI have had my Sony MDR1R headphones for about two years now, and I absolutely love them. But I've been keeping my eyes out for a good deal on some nice wireless headphones for a while.Very satisfied with Sony's products. I hopped on the Black Friday deal for the h.ear on's, and I've been using them for a couple months now. The sound is pretty comparable to the MDR1R's, which in my opinion is pretty great, quite balanced as far as I can tell. I'm not an audiophile but I do appreciate good quality sound. I have never had noise cancelling headphones before so I don't have anything to compare it too. They do a great job of cancelling out the sound of the heater in my apartment and things like that. Battery life is great too, I usually get at least a week of listening time in, and more if I turn off the NC. The controls were very easy for me to figure out and get used to, and I am glad that the noise cancelling feature can be turned off, if it is not needed. And it is good that they can be used even with the power off, although it doesn't sound quite as good, as I think the sound is slightly amplified when the power is on.\\nMy only complaint is that they are not as comfortable as my MDR1R's. They are noticeably tighter and put more pressure on my head, which isn't even big. I suppose this is understandable as they should be tighter as to avoid falling off your head since they are wireless. I've also found they are more comfortable when I wear my contacts rather than my glasses. I'm still fiddling with the headband adjustments and positioning to try to find the most comfortable way to wear them. I've been able to wear them for a few hours with hardly any discomfort.\\n\\nOverall I think these are a very nice pair of wireless headphones with good quality sound and easy to use controls; I would recommend them as a less expensive alternative to the Bose QuietComfort 35, to which they are often compared to.","[]","B01CQXGKWK","B01CQXGKWK","AE2TOJ2TL4UCTZMEELEESXBR7H7A","2017-01-12 19:29:41.000","2","True","506"

After an extensive research of this tablet and other Wacom alternatives , I decided to buy this one and try it out\\n\\nSetting up the 22HD took less than 30 minutes, it was easy to do, as long as you read and follow the instructions. Now, for the driver installation, make sure to remove your Wacom drivers before installing 22HD's (Please read the Quick-Guide, it's very helpful and their Customer service is top-notch). You can install the driver from the CD it came with but make sure to update it by downloading it from XP-PEN'S website, before using it. I've not had issues with the drivers. (OS: Windows 10)\\n\\nI absolutely love how easy it is to use!! It has a beautiful screen,  although there is a tiny bit of parallax, it's not a big deal for me. It responds perfectly to the pressure sensitivity and I don't mind the location of the wiring, it works fine with my desk setup (but they did listen to the customer input and changed it on their new 22E tablet). It works best if you set both your computer monitor and the tablet to 1920 x 1080 resolution. I also recommend buying a monitor arm/mount.(I bought the Ergotech Freedom Arm, easy to install)\\n\\nIt works great with the following programs I frequently use:\\nPaint Tool Sai\\nFireAlpaca\\nGIMP\\nCLIP Studio Paint EX\\nBlender\\nSculptris\\nAnime Studio\\n\\nSo far, I am enjoying this product and I'm glad I chose this one, not only for the price but the customer service of XP-PEN is one of the best I have ever had.","[]","B015FP25V6","B015FP25V6","AGCFKTN4A2O2EL67F3D6QFMYOL2Q","2017-03-01 15:37:43.000","4","True","506"
"265243","4","Pretty Great for Scan Ordering. Careful With The Laser!","I predict that this Wand is going to be a hot commodity in the near future, but for now it's only okay. The best thing that this wand does is to add items to your Amazon Cart by scanning the bar codes - which is pretty awesome. Note that it doesn't always recognize bar codes, but for the most part I found it worked well using the bar codes on the outside of packaging on common items that are in stock on Amazon, including some that I didn't expect it to find. I love that it has a magnet on it. I keep the Wand stuck to my fridge so I can scan items quickly.\\n\\nIt also has a voice feature that uses Alexa, so you can add items to your bag by voice. It's a great feature, but it doesn't work all that well in my tests. For starters, Alexa had a tough time recognizing what I wanted her to order. If I didn't use the exact wording for the item as listed by the seller, she'd either say she didn't understand or repeat something back to me that wasn't what I wanted. The voice ordering feature is imperfect, but hopefully it will improve with time. It also requires you to have a voice code set up in order to confirm your order, but I never set one up and that wasn't part of the activation process for this item, so it took a LOT of hunting around to find it. (And I'm not sure I'd find it easily again.) This is old news for Alexa / Echo / Dot users, I imagine, but since the Wand activation didn't prompt me to create a code or tell me where to find it, it was an aggravation.\\n\\nThe very worst part of using the voice activation, though, is that the scanner laser activates even while you're speaking. The natural tendency is to hold this toward your face like a microphone, but doing so might blind you with the laser - since it will point directly up toward your eyes - so I don't recommend doing that. It's really weird, but with practice you can point it parallel to your face and speak into the microphone, which I assume is the small hole near the button. Just make sure no one is sitting across from you, or you'll blind them instead!\\n\\nBeing able to turn off the scanner while using voice would make this a much better design, but for the moment I think I'll just stick to using the scanner.","[]","B01MQMJFDK","B01MQMJFDK","AEEV4GBNUENV4IFDWWQGLOTBZMGQ","2017-07-14 19:06:32.131","4","True","506"

I Hope It Keeps Ticking!","Since Pebble was bought by Fitbit, I've watched the fluctuating prices and have tried 3 different Pebbles as their prices dipped, taking my chances and hoping that they will continue to work for some time. I've tried the Steel, Time Steel, and now this one. They all are good, but I've decided to keep the Steel and this one. Here's a quick rundown of my experience:\\n1. Bought Steel. Loved how it looked and worked, but had issues with connectivity with my iPhone. Returned it.\\n2. Bought Time Steel. Liked how it looked, but big bezel made the look just short of what I wanted to look at on my wrist. When THAT watch also started to have connectivity issues, I figured out how to remove the device from phone and reconnect. After that it worked fine.\\n3. Bought Steel again. Works great, looks great. Semi-classy or formal looking, nice leather band. Still wanted an everyday Pebble, though, just not sure I wanted that to be the Time Steel with it's thick bezel, even though it's still pretty nice, and way nicer looking than the Time (which I never bought because the bezel looks ridiculous and cheap to me. Of course, it's all personal taste.)\\n3. Bought this one (Pebble 2 with HR). Thought it would look ugly, but no! It's really thin and trim in your hands and on your wrist. Nicer than looks in pictures. Very happy with it. It's extremely light and comfortable on your wrist. Battery life phenomenal. Notifications work perfectly. Heart monitor is nice to have, seems relatively accurate based on activities I'm doing. Only downside is that text responses I send with the phone never get sent, even though I set it up to do so with AT&T. The texts say they were sent but never arrive. No big deal. It's very rare I would want to send a text with my watch anyway.\\n4. Selling Time Steel. I have my Steel when I want to wear a somewhat classier and formal watch (although all Pebbles, including the Steel, have a slightly geeky look to them), and my Pebble 2 as my everyday wear, run, swim, sleep watch. I'm happy as long as they continue to work! Fitbit says they'll support through 2017. Who knows if developer community will keep any support going beyond that.","[]","B01KM4NJQA","B01KM4NJQA","AFVENAWS7AGLQHHFTVVINGERTXPQ","2017-07-27 16:10:53.749","2","True","506"

Sometimes it's great other times it's terrible. This is for both day and night conditions. I can't pinpoint an environmental condition that is causing poor performance.\\n\\nEase of install; it's very easy. It didn't take much time at all. The only extra tool you might need is pliers.

We had to pull it back a bit because shadows from cars on the sidewalk and reflections from lights on the sidewalk/yard in the rain were triggering motion alerts.\\n\\nStability; after 48 hours of use I had to flip the breaker off and back on because the ring stopped responding. Video is sometimes black with no images (day and night) and sometimes grainy with significant artifacting like my attached photo. In that photo it was my wife at the mailbox, walking to the car, then pulling out of the driveway.

"638484","3","Has promise, but too buggy and too limited right now","This device is pretty neat, but its utility is pretty limited. I thought I would be scanning items like crazy to add them to my shopping cart, but it turns out that Amazon's prices are (for the most part) more expensive than my local retailers, and many items aren't available. The barcode scanner is a fun way to rack up an expensive shopping cart, but to be honest adding items via Alexa is tedious and not very enjoyable.\\n\\nAlexa is a cool feature, but it's way too limited – it doesn't even have a timer! I would definitely use it more if it had more functionality; maybe this can be addressed with a firmware update or something, but as it stands it relies too much on the companion app (which it shouldn't even need, in my opinion) to do too little. Sometimes the voice recognition is a little spotty, but for the most part it's very accurate. On that note – your voice clips are kept around on Amazon's servers until your delete them. If you don't, I believe they're there forever.\\n\\nRight now, I basically only use Alexa for weather forecasts and conditions before I go out, although I have to admit it does have some novel functionality like recipes and news headlines. Unfortunately, Alexa seems to be a little buggy, too: sometimes it will tell you that it is able to do something, but then when you try it, you're told that functionality isn't available on this device – for example, it will sometimes tell you that it's able to play music through your Amazon Music account, but when asked to do so you're told that's not possible.\\n\\nIf someone from Amazon is reading this: please push out a firmware update that adds and fixes some functionality. Otherwise, right now the Dash Wand is a great idea that can be easily hampered by high prices; in that case, Alexa is the saving grace of the device, but that feature gets frustrating very quickly when you're told whatever it is you wanted to do isn't possible on this device, which happens far too often for a &#34;smart&#34; device. The hardware certainly seems capable of it (and let's face it, it's not like it's actually doing any computations anyway), so please give us more functionality and reduce its dependence on the companion app. As it stands, there is not much reason to use Alexa over Siri or Google Assistant.","[]","B01MQMJFDK","B01MQMJFDK","AHIEG3VWWLMDIUO76NT33LHDWA2Q","2017-09-14 01:09:52.519","1","True","506"
"642894","2","Decent camera but mobile app is GARBAGE!","Since Nikon is one of the industry leaders I had high hopes for this camera.  A quick breakdown of my findings.  The good: The size is small and portable for travel, etc.  The zoom is excellent with great range.  Lot of modes to choose from.  Auto really works well for most of your shots - it's very intelligent.  Nikkor optics are clear and sharp.  BUT these deficiencies outweigh the advantages and kill value of this camera for me personally:\\n\\nMOBILE APP\\n* Hands down the WORST mobile app I have seen in the app store.  Worse than the Comcast TV app (gasp). It's useless.  Using the firmware that the camera came with I was able to connect to my iPhone 7 Plus with the Snapbridge mobile app but it wouldn't stay connected for more than 1-2 seconds, then the connection would be lost.  Nikon support recommended upgrading to the latest version of the firmware so I did that.  HUGE MISTAKE.  Now I can't connect the camera to my iPhone at all no matter what I do.  And I can't go back to the previous version of the firmware now either.  They don't make it available.  The remote operation capabilities of the Snapbridge mobile app was a must have feature for me.\\n\\nSELF-TIMER\\nIf you use a self-timer a lot you will be very disappointed.  You can set either 2s or 10s delay BUT ONLY FOR ONE SHOT.  Then you have to keep setting it again over and over.  It's makes family photos really cumbersome.\\n\\nBATTERY CHARGER\\nUm, there isn't one.  You have to plug the charging cable directly into the camera.  This is a bit of a pain if you have multiple batteries that you like to keep charged up.\\n\\nNIKON you are the camera market leader.  Can't you do a better job than this?  Your mobile app is rated 1 star on the app store and that's too high.  Where is the Nikon quality and pride you are so well known for?  I am really disappointed.  I am returning this camera, and trying out the Canon SX60 HS - at least it has a useful self-timer.  Not sure about the WIFI and software, we'll see.","[]","B01C3LE44G","B01C3LE44G","AGZOFR5TJSIILYOOSVLXVZWNGCYA","2017-10-12 20:18:40.093","2","False","506"
"525550","2","Disappointing quality control on a great design (USB disconnecting + more)","Let's start with the good in this keyboard, because there is a lot to like. The design is perfect. Slim, compact. Feels solid with little flex, but isn't too heavy. The brushed aluminum looks great. The included keys are also useful (media controls, music button, mail button). Only key it's missing is the sleep key. I used this keyboard with a Win 10 PC, as I'm assuming was intended based on the Windows key.\\nSpeaking of the keys, they have a short travel distance and stay satisfyingly quiet. The flat and minimal design looks great anywhere. It would be my favorite keyboard ever.\\n\\nWould be.\\n\\nUnfortunately, there are a number of issues with the keyboard that make it severely annoying to use day-to-day. I'd say the biggest issue is the disconnecting. At any point, the keyboard can disconnect from the PC for 2-3 seconds at a time. If you're playing a game, whatever keys you were pressing upon disconnecting will continue to be pressed until the keyboard reconnects and you press and unpress those keys. The disconnect can be triggered by touching the cable, moving the keyboard, or simply existing in this material plane. I've heard it disconnecting and reconnecting when I wasn't even in the room.\\nThe 6 key doesn't work. At all. Only on the number pad. I don't like to have numpad turned on because the LED indicator bleeds light from underneath the home key, and into the other indicators. (picture included)\\nThere are a lot of gaps between the keys and the board underneath.\\n\\nSo with these issues present, I ordered a replacement. Here are the issues the replacement had:\\n* Still disconnected\\n* The 6 key still doesn't work\\n* Now, the B key is having issues; Needs a harder than usual press to register. A couple other letters suffer the same fate. While they still technically work, the firmness they need to register often sees me miss those letters when typing naturally. There is no reason for a keyboard to require extra attention to specifically press certain letters much harder than others.\\n\\nTL;DR: Product has much potential but is plagued by issues in manufacturing. Highly disappointing that even the replacement board exhibited the same issues (and more). Cannot recommend this board when each order is a lottery.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717B3cBMcVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717B3cBMcVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717B3cBMcVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B005IPKU20","B00EYWU8HK","AEMF3KDY6G5TF5HNPPG6WVPDQSMA","2017-11-14 04:57:56.094","1","True","506"
"680385","5","Sangean WE-11 vs Tivoli Model One","I've owned the Tivoli for over 5 years. The Tivoli sounds good when it's new. It has a warm, rich sounds. Sounds better on AM talk stations than the Sangean. The Tivoli is true analog tuning. It's noisy and the tuner drifts badly. The tuner drifts within a few minutes and it drifts pretty far. I have to turn my dial back and forth over almost 10mHz to recapture the signal. Tuning between stations is noisy. Sounds like the tuner potentiometer is dirty, but it's not the type that you can clean. It has to be replaced, and that's more drama than I care to deal with.\\nI got the WR-11SE for my birthday. I asked for it to replace the Tivoli because of the above issues. The Sangean seems to use PLL tuning. The tuner is quiet in between stations and locks on tight when it finds a good signal. The display is linear rather than a dial and it's backlit, so the Sangean display is much easier to read than the Tivoli. The Sangean has a warmer, more bass heavy sound then the Tivoli. This makes the Sangean sound better than the Tivoli for FM music. I've listened to AM talk on the Sangean and it sounds clean and clear. The Sangean just sounds a bit warmer and more compressed than the Tivoli. The other reviews can tell you about all the specs, etc.\\nThe Sangean is about half (or less!) the price of a Tivoli. You're buying the Tivoli name and the Henry Kloss name, but the radio is inferior, in my opinion. I own several other Sangean radios and they're all high quality. Sangean is and always has been a Chinese company. Their radios are and always have been made in China. Since Sangean originally started in China and it's NOT a new company that has built itself off stealing and counterfeiting designs from other companies, it's one of the few Chinese companies that actually makes high quality products. I've been buying and using Sangean radios since the 1990's and I've never had a dud. They've all been very good radios. Sangean is equal in quality to Panasonic and Sony. I definitely recommend this radio over the Tivoli Model One.","[]","B00IGXENR4","B019Z9VB22","AFPDL5RKJ4CDZYRRLRHLKMIF42ZQ","2017-10-25 18:28:17.045","218","True","506"
"875130","4","Nice, but somewhat large, stiff and heavy","I got this 3 weeks ago and the price was a hundred and change, so as I write this review I'm shocked that the price has bumped up over twenty-nine bucks in such a short time.  In any case, this is a very different animal from my original tiny little Gorilla Pod, which can only support my 195g Canon S95, but not my  440g Fujifilm X30, and certainly nothing heavier than that.  THIS GorillaPod is strong, however.  The legs are strong and too stiff, and I can see it being somewhat difficult to wrap it around things as advertised (the legs feel like they might snap if you did that).  The ball head very nice, good quality.  I'm sending this particular tripod back because after looking at it, I've redefined what I need a small tripod for...not for wrapping around posts and such, which might be moderately useful occasionally, but rather, I want more of a lower tabletop tripod for shooting macro and closeups of things. I also tried my heavy Nikon D70S with its large, heavy zoom lens (I think it weighs 1.7 lbs total) and this GP supported it just fine no matter what position I put it in.  However, since I want one of these that it more suitable for travel (shorter, lighter) and I don't travel with my Nikon,  I'm returning this one (too large, high and heavy for my needs) and I think I'll get the newer, smaller 1K GorillaPod because it suits my intended use AND it is still small/light enough to take on trips...plus I think the legs might be easier to wrap around the occasional chair or pole.  The weight capacity of the 1K version covers my two main cameras and is still compact and light enough to have more uses than this one.  The legs on this large GP don't seem to be all the maneuverable, and I can definitely believe an earlier review in which the legs broke.  I'd be afraid of that with this one...I think the metal in it affects things and I'd worry about the longevity of this GP.  There is a newer (better?) version of this model (5K) out now, but the price is crazy high.  I gave this tripod 4 stars because it really does seem strong and nicely made if it fits your particular needs.  I obviously can't commend on how long it lasts without breaking.","[]","B003II3FD0","B07VZZNCNW","AEJCHRIFWAYNFKIJWMGYAJGZ7JPA","2017-11-04 05:18:54.881","1","True","506"

"655374","5","Outstanding 4.5 star speaker compared to Bose SoundLink III","My wife received a Bose SLIII as a Christmas gift and I received the Oontz Angle 3XL as a gift at the same time. Having previously done my research I knew that the Oontz was around 1/3 the price of the Bose. The price of the Oontz was right for me and I would have purchased for myself if not for the gift, so we were elated that we got the Bose as a gift and assumed the Oontz was going to be returned straight away. However, we decided to do a side by side comparison to see if maybe the Oontz was good enough to keep in the garage.\\n\\nWe were absolutely stunned at how poor the Bose performed. The sound is extremely muddy. At first on low volume with a fairly tame pop song we got excited as we started to glimpse that room filling warmth we all love about Bose. But as soon as we turned up the volume we were sorely disappointed with poor high and mid clarity. And when listening to something more demanding with heavy base or distorted guitars that warmth twisted into a splatty, staticy, muddy sound that was simply unacceptable.\\n\\nThe ULTRA clear highs and mids produced by the Oontz just served to highlight where the Bose fell short. I'll admit that the bass on the Oontz is lacking so I will dock half a star for that. However, the lows on this unit are definitely good enough considering the price, portability, and clarity of sound. I am now convinced that there is no way to just throw money at a portable speaker (Bose) and get a better sound. If I want perfect sound, someday I'll have to upgrade to stationary units for each of my kitchen, garage, workout room, and backyard. For now I'll just tote this little guy around and look forward to the next update from Cambridge SoundWorks.\\n\\nAside from sound quality, the Oontz stood out as having the following additional features that the Bose did not:\\n-  Better Bluetooth range. The Bose started dropping connection even in the adjacent room. The Oontz stayed connected from any location in our large two story house.\\n-  Speakerphone\\n-  Buttons to skip tracks or pause/play on the unit\\n-  Ability to charge another device such as a phone\\n-  Water resistance","[]","B016ZDDSPY","B016ZDDSPY","AEQVPKS4MEA4PLX4LA5RDTVJWTCQ","2017-01-02 06:12:55.000","1","False","506"
"233829","1","Receiver distance and placement an issue","Description says receiver can detect transmitter from as far as 400' away.  I placed my sensor and transmitter about 260' away, which was a clear shot to the the receiver without obstructions except for one double window pane just inside the front entrance to our house.  Receiver was one inch from window. Receiver did not respond even though transmitter lit up when car passed by on my 10' wide driveway. After moving receiver to open front porch, about 2' forward (no window pane), then it worked.  Called tech control.  He said try moving transmitter (and sensor) about 15' closer. Instead, I moved it 40' closer and tested it (sensor on ground surface) twice with two different family vehicles (Toyota Yaris and Honda Odyssey).  It worked.  Then I buried sensor, wiring, and transmitter base once again.  Dip switches match.  Now works only sometimes with vehicles. Frustrating! Uprooting and reburying 12&#34; down in a new location is a pain. Stated limiting distance ought to be more like 150', not 400'.  Now, I either try moving closer once again or return product to Amazon and look for another brand, but moving closer means vehicles are already halfway down my driveway before detection. Will test for 2 more days and then decide.\\nUPDATE 8/19/2017\\nMoved the receiver to an entry window on the other side of my front door (6' to the left) and raised it about 12&#34; above window aluminum frame.  Now works every time! Upgraded rating from 1 to 3 stars.  Perhaps the problem is related to the fact there is a 6' wall sticking out to the front outside the other window.  It did not obstruct the straight-line view however. So if you have receiver problems, try moving it to other unobstructed locations. Will keep this product...much cheaper than any similar item.\\nUPDATE 8/24/2017\\nAfter 6 days my unit quit working altogether. Checked outside batteries, which were still fully charged.  Instead of continuing to troubleshoot for the umpteenth time, I decided to return the unit to Amazon. My 30-day return period was up on 8/25/2017 (next day), so I quickly dug up the outside unit, cleaned it up, packaged it, and returned it via UPS.  Now looking for a more reliable driveway alert system.","[]","B003765W0W","B0C1ZSQL2V","AFOQEEAARLOTZCRKNTN5G5JEZ7VQ","2017-08-16 22:49:09.966","2","True","506"
"941128","4","Large grip provides plenty of power and a great price","I bought this battery grip for my Canon 80D. I was looking for both longer running time and shutter buttons for portrait shots. As others have pointed out, this grip costs less than one third the price of the official Canon part and includes two extra batteries.\\n\\nMaterials are very nice.  The grip looks and feels like the Cannon grip. The casing is the same matte plastic and the rubberized grip matches the feel and look of the camera. Inside the battery compartment you will find a metal frame along the bottom, a plastic honeycomb supports the rest of the grip. The metal sub frame is attached directly to the tripod mount for a secure fit without flex. The battery tray does not appear to be weather sealed.\\n\\nButtons form and function closely follow the Canon equivalents on the camera. Feedback is just a bit softer than on the camera. With less “pop” to them, but not what I would call mushy. The shutter button has a nice double click. The jog dial is feels a bit hollow, almost as if it has an echo. It is also not rubberized like the one on the camera.\\n\\nThe grip comes with a plastic pin cover. There is a slot to hold the OEM battery door while the grip is installed. I really with the insert that goes into the camera battery slot could be collapsed when not in use. I am worried that it may snap off if not on the camera. The Canon battery grip suffers from the same issue, however.\\n\\nBattery trays are glossy plastic. I would prefer matte as scratches would not show up as easily. The contacts are bronze and the batteries install with a satisfying click.\\n\\nOnce installed on the camera, I would the grip to be a tad uncomfortable to hold for long periods of time. It just wasn’t built with small hands in mind. Again, this is also an issue with the Canon battery grip, and something I was aware of before purchase. For me, the extra battery capacity and portrait shutter buttons meant I could leave a lot of gear at home when out and about.\\n\\nAnd those batteries. The two included batteries are rated at 2600mAh compared to 1865mAh on the Canon battery. If the capacity is accurate, the battery grip may provide close to three times the power than the OEM battery provides.\\n\\nOverall, a very good product for the money.","[]","B00PC0M1G4","B00PC0M1G4","AGIHA63OXQ6OPRFF4RSZPUSGMSOA","2017-03-01 23:18:08.000","7","True","506"

The headphone outoput at it's highest impedence setting on my 80ohm DT770s does not allow the headphones to get loud at all, and I'm really not the type of person to listen to anything &#34;really&#34; loud, so just imagine moderate volume, and there's your max.\\n\\nThere's no way to set different equalizer settings for your headphones and your speakers, so if you want to use the equalizer that comes with the soundstudio software, you're going to have to settle for having the same setting for both your headphones and your speakers.\\n\\nVolume in general is very low on my speakers (JBL LSR305), which is another annoyance.  Honestly, volume is low all around on this device--why?  My onboard sound is much louder, but with the LSR305s turned all the way up on the speakers, I often have to raise my volume in windows and volume in whatever I might be using (foobar, media player classic, netflix, any game..) to 90%+ on every slider.  What's going on with this thing?  My onboard is quite literally twice as loud, so this is very disappointing.\\n\\nThe microphone input does seem noise free, which is a plus.  The volume nob and headphone/speaker input switching both work great, and the device takes up very little desk space.\\n\\nOverall, I can't recommend this if you're looking for a catch-all audio solution that plays good at moderate to high volumes.  I don't know where ASUS went wrong with this device, but man is it quiet.  I even tried using my own equalizer (peace + equalizer apo), but it just makes my headphones clip with the volume all the way up.  That's another thing--with the soundstudio equalizer adjusting a few levels to around +5/+6db and others -1/-2db (think a moderate V), my headphones clip at moderate volumes.  I can plug my headphones into my onboard audio and get literally twice the volume with NO CLIPPING!

"768540","4","Good TV with a Bad OS","Got this TV over a year ago (not off Amazon, from another source), so I thought I could give a decent review now.  First thing to note is that I don't even notice any light bleed.  I always watch the TV with the lights on or in the daytime so it's not even an issue for me.  If I get the room pitch black and display a dark picture of some kind, I can see it, but I don't notice it when watching normal TV shows, or even movies like Star Trek and Star Wars that show a lot of black outer space shots.  Personally I love the picture and the sound this thing puts out.  Even non-HD shows and cartoons look way better than on a regular HD TV.  We use it without a sound system because we have an infant and toddler in the house and the sound is also very good for what it is.\\n\\nThe reason I can't give 5 stars is because of the operating system.  We use this exclusively for streaming online content and don't watch live TV shows any more.  Because of that it's a big deal that Android runs like garbage on this TV.  It's bad enough that I would compare it to the older versions of Windows like Millennium or Vista.  When we first got it, it worked fine for a while, but then every time it went to sleep mode, we would turn the TV on and it wouldn't play content.  Full hard resets were necessary every time we wanted to use it.  This went on for over a year before they updated Android and fixed the issue.  Super annoying.  Now we have a problem that seems like not enough RAM on a PC.  When we start streaming a show, if we adjust the volume knob (or even sometimes when we're just doing nothing) the picture will freeze and hiccup before going again.  We have to pause and wait for the TV to catch up before it is watchable again.  The freezing picture is not due to buffering because it almost always does it only when you push a button on the remote.\\n\\nOverall I think this is a good TV, and I would call it great if Sony and Google could get together and actually make the software run properly.  If you fed a 3rd party media center through the TV you probably wouldn't even notice any issues unless you're very picky about the light bleed issue other reviewers have noted.","[]","B00R45XL64","B00R45XL64","AFY4XJWOGQRRJ2AQSXH6DTDPBKXQ","2017-07-18 17:13:13.794","0","False","506"
"512191","3","It is a hit and a huge miss at the same time","I am great at using on screen keyboards, but Android never really perfected one like Appe has, so it tends to lag when I type fast. Best solution I thought would be a physical keyboard, but not so much. Blackberry just tries to be too different with their devices, which is working against them. Samsung strides at being the best, but they perfect their products after they release it, people complain, and they try to correct that issue with a net release.\\nMy thoughts with this keyboard: It is nice to have one As an accessory that you can always remove without losing screen size for media fun. That's the only plus in my opinion, because typing on this keyboard can get pretty annoying, it simply doesn't register all your clicks, so a proofreading is a must. PRESSES must be hard and slow otherwise you'll end up with not registered letter that will autocorrect into another word. Forget about fast typing, it simply can't keep up. Next issue is that these keys are too close to one another, I always manage to click another key accidentally. No notification whether you're typing with capital letters or numerical numbers, and sometimes keys get stuck on special characters. HUGE FLAW is no backlighting to these keys, I've ready people complaining about it, but I thought to myself that light from the screen might provide some sort of lighting, and I was wrong, since this keyboard is raised above the screen there is absolutely no benefit from screen light, I just couldn't see a single letter. I tried to see if I can type by memory,  due to these being so close to on another it just ended up being a mess. Most of the time I ended up clicking on a home button rather than space, so there is no way this keyboardcan be used without light, maybe if you memorize this keyboard fully with key locations, special character keys, where numbers are the rest, which will take weeks if not more.\\nDo I hate it? No, but I don't know if I'll keep it. I need backlighting, I think it's a must. Including two mages, one with day light,  and second one is with curtains slightly closed. I don't think this is worth the full price that it is currently sold as, maybe a $20 value, then I wouldn't mind the compromise, but when I shell out neary a grand on a phone and $60 on this cover, then that's an issue.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61De2JoqozL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61De2JoqozL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61De2JoqozL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AM3dpqmOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AM3dpqmOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AM3dpqmOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B06XJ5XMPB","B06XJ5XMPB","AEOABCABLMHUPQWA4RKX53532S3A","2017-06-02 13:57:11.000","19","True","506"
"289589","4","Tiny Amp but does it do rated power?","I love mini amps and I love testing amps. The Dual DA301L is rated to deliver 150x1 at 4 ohms or 350x1 at 2 ohms. It will literally fit in the palm of your hand, so can it really put out this much power? Let's talk about this features first, then we will get to the actual measured output power.\\n\\nOne end of the amp includes insert for plug of either RCA or high level inputs, then 4 potentiometers for adjusting input gain, subsonic filter, bass boost and low-pass crossover frequency. The opposite end has speaker output and power inputs in addition to a 30A pico fuse. Both speaker and power harnesses are on wiring harnesses with plastic plugs that attach to the amplifier. The first think you'll notice is the TINY size of the wires. The speaker outputs and power inputs are both 18ga (although 2 wires per positive/negative connection are provided). Still, this does not seem like enough copper to transfer the 30A or more of current this amp is capable of pulling.\\n\\nFor my tests, I use a SMD/D'Amore Engineering Amplifier Dyno (model AD-1). Here are the results I obtained (all tests performed at 40Hz):\\n\\n4 ohms - 134 watts at 1% THD, 14.54 volts (certified mode) - amp rated 150 watts @14.4 volts\\n  - 168 watts at clipping; 14.47 volts (uncertified mode)\\n  - 179 watts Dynamic RMS Power; 14.48 volts\\n\\n2 ohms - 214 watts at 1% THD; 14.46 volts (certified mode) - amp rated 350 watts @14.4 volts\\n  - 295 watts at clipping; 14.28 volts (uncertified mode)\\n  - 311 watts Dynamic RMS Power; 14.38 volts\\n\\nAlthough it didn't quite do rated power, I did like the build quality, inside and out. For the size and cost, I like this amp, but have not verified the long term reliability of it. This amp is similar to the Kenwood KAC-M3001, which is slightly smaller and puts out similar power. You can see both amps tested on my YouTube channel under the username BigDWiz.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711BdG5s+EL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711BdG5s+EL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711BdG5s+EL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00KECBN0A","B00KECBN0A","AHWEWLYIRYR55QPTNAYX3OXAHKMQ","2017-12-23 18:24:52.393","45","True","506"
"259216","1","DON'T TAKE ANY CALLBACKS FROM ASUS SUPPORT.  YOU COULD BE SCAMMED.","It's BIG, and it's great! ASUS scores again with this slightly larger 8 port router.  I've been using it for 4 months and not a single reset.  I love not needing a switch plugged in to one of my ports because I don't have enough hard-wired ports.  I've got more signal bars in my basement than I've had with any other router in the past.  The router is located on the 2 floor, two levels up.  So far I've had between 10 and 15 devices on the wifi without any problems.  My internet service line is fiber optic cable, so it takes a router like this one to take advantage of the throughput.  My cell phone gets 400 mbps download on wifi, and my computer gets 600 mbps with an ethernet connection.  My streaming movies NEVER pause for buffering.  This router can be plugged in, set up, and forgotten.  It just works.\\nJune 2017 AMENDMENT:\\nThe 2.4 ghz network will not stay connected to any of my devices.  I have check all the settings and installed the latest firmware.  In desperation, I CALLED THE SUPPORT PHONE NUMBER FROM THE ASUS WEBSITE.  Here's what happened:  Support answered, heavy India accent, said he was in India.  He said he needed to call me back to help me.  After just a few minutes, he did call back--same voice and accent.  (Here's where the scam begins).  He used TEAM VIEWER to look at my router through my computer.  He said my hardware was OK, but that my software was messed up (interesting since I had only programmed the wifi SSID's and passwords and updated the firmware).  He then said that for a one-time $50 payment, they could fix my router.  (All my scam alarms went off).  I refused to pay the $50 charge.  He refused to fix my router.  My worry is that he was in my computer long enough with team viewer to see passwords, hack my email, etc, etc.  So it appears to me that Asus has some people making money on the side in their call center in India.  DON'T ACCEPT ANY CALLBACKS FROM THE ASUS SUPPORT UNIT!  BTW, I have alerted the Asus support people through email of this incident, and they have not addressed it in any way.","[]","B016EWKQAQ","B099QB16MK","AGE3OAHKEVMROIWNJPKLSJXFU6OA","2017-02-08 01:38:46.000","6","True","506"
"958349","2","If I had it to do over again, I'd go with AsRock or MSI","Update 4/14/17. ASUS released version 1503 of their BIOS on 4/1 which miraculously turned bad memory slots into good memory slots.  As I'd previously indicated this isn't a clean motherboard from my past experience with ASUS, far from it. It also confirms what a lot of us searching through troubleshooting boards on the Internet knew already, that there were problems.  I can't say how many hours I lost fiddling with this motherboard just to get memory and POST issues resolved, and dealing with ASUS support. Nope, I never RMA'd it either because others who received new or repaired boards had the same issues.  If you buy this motherboard the first thing you should do is upgrade to 1503 BIOS before you do anything else in terms of troubleshooting.  It will save you a lot of grief.\\n\\nI'll update this if I encounter anymore strange issues but my original review still applies.\\n\\nThis is my 5th ASUS motherboard and while I still like it I wish ASUS would get its act together on a few things.  First, as always there's the usual software and support issues that come with owning anything ASUS.  I put 32GB of memory on it and it only recognizes 24GB of it.  It's a common problem across all motherboards, I confirmed the QVL and P/Ns would work with the motherboard, still only 24GB.  I've opened two tickets to get it fixed and I get the usual &#34;reset CMOS&#34; answer which doesn't work.\\nThe memory card slots are so close to the first PCI slot, the one preferred for best performance of the video card, there's no room if you have memory like Corsair Dominator Platinum, to fit a typical video card, both my R9 390 and GTX 1080 won't fit.\\nThen there's the software issues, AISuite for years has been the PITA of many ASUS motherboard owners and it's still buggy, you have to reinstall it over and and over to finally get it to work right.  Oh and forget EzUpdate, that POS has never worked.  The AURA software for LED control is still buggy as hell and only works 1/2 the time.\\n\\nOverall I'm disappointed, I'm really disappointed in terms of cost for what you get.  I'll probably keep this one for awhile and sell it on Craigslist.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713EauSihHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713EauSihHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713EauSihHL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LEOKRwYyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LEOKRwYyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LEOKRwYyL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71h4Krt4+VL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71h4Krt4+VL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71h4Krt4+VL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ppkSX2ZtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ppkSX2ZtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ppkSX2ZtL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01GHQM1CA","B01GHQM1CA","AFTGZC2NIO3OZSQHUANETX4J5HVA","2017-01-14 13:19:49.000","3","True","506"
"748603","3","It's okay, but not all it's cracked up to be.","VHF reception is pretty darn good. Just about the limit for distance rated (40 miles).\\n\\nUHF is a little disappointing at distance limit. It does pull in a decent signal strength, but with errors and glitches in the picture. Using an RCA amplifier with this, or I'd get zero UHF channels.\\n\\nIt's been a challenge in my location to get good signal. Maybe need a larger antenna with more elements, but I'm not sure it'd help.\\nThis little antenna is ok for now, but I'm not sure it's as great as others rate it. Granted, it's not meant for the best &#34;fringe&#34; reception, but it is rated for &#34;red&#34; on the box.\\n\\nSpeaking of the box, I was surprised it didn't include bolts for the mount. Plan on reusing any if you have them, or making a trip to the hardware store. Had a mount already, but for those that don't, look out for this.\\n\\nOverall, it isn't bad, and I'm sure it works great in areas a little closer to towers. Might need an amp. I might need a better one, larger antenna, or both. Just not sure about its UHF abilities. A little disappointed there. Little higher SNR, but higher numbers of errors, and I'm not sure what that's about. Seems like it will not hold up during bad weather on those channels where it barely works. Time will tell.\\n\\nPros - relatively small for an outdoor antenna. VHF is good. Comes with a balun / transformer, but be gentle with it. Can get UHF decently, but might be too sensitive. Light weight. Should hold up to weather.\\n\\nCons - UHF very sensitive. Very close to it's rated range there, and will be at the mercy of any interference. No lag bolts. Cheap balun, but it does work. Really need an amp at the limits of distance to boost signal.\\n\\nAbout worth the price. Should factor in cost of an amp if you're at the limit of it's rated distance. Time will tell if I keep this. Probably works great at 20 miles with few obstructions. Iffy at 40 some miles even with an amp for UHF.","[]","B0024R4B5C","B0B7FN67QT","AGZNNLHIEC5OV7LKCLNF34QIZANQ","2017-08-20 15:23:48.300","0","False","506"
"89461","5","Would like HDR pass-through","Well, you get for what you paid for.  This is an expensive sound bar, but IMO, its worth every penny!\\nLittle bit background, I am an audiophile and have always owned heavy gears like space robbing Paradigm Reference speakers and power hungry mono block amps...  Due to the new living situation, I was forced to seek alternative.  Done a ton of research and decided to try out the YSP5600.  There are a few sound bars on the market that is ATMOS ready, however, none of them is as compact (single unit) as the YSP5600, nor the ability to decode all DTS formats.  ATMOS is a relatively new format with limited sources out there, but not DTS.  Plain DTS and DTSMA has been out for years and just about all movies are in this format.  So having this sound bar that acts like a receiver for decoding and HDMI switching, I can forgo it's weakness, IMO is only the HDR pass-through which it does not have.\\nNow, getting this sound bar to sound proper has its prerequisites.  You can't just go out and get this sound bar expecting it to sound good.  First, you have to have a properly sized room, with proper distant walls and ceiling, without too many openings.  Two, you have to mount it properly, at least 3 feet from the floor and 6 feet from your sitting position.  Three, you have to calibrate it correctly (even with the auto tune, I still had to manually adjust it).  Four, you MUST have a sub to boot, without it, you will immediately notice something is missing.  However, if you meet all the criteria and have it dialed in just right, you will experience something fascinating.  You will catch yourself looking around the room, looking for the origin of the sounds you hear.  This sound bar tricks your ears and brain superbly by projecting sounds to the ceiling and bouncing them off of the walls.  I don't sit in the center of the room so I do not get much of the rear effects.  But the vocal, front separation, the ATMOS height effect, its all there and some.  Needless to say, I am very pleased with this sound bar!  Kudos to Yamaha!  Now if they can upgrade the firmware to allow HDR pass through, I think that will be the icing on the cake!","[]","B016B44AP4","B07F2KG67D","AFR4XYGT4TIEALLPQGA6UVZVEPAQ","2017-12-29 18:57:31.905","55","True","506"

I figured I'd wear this while sightseeing and wanted something anti-theft and had phone charging capabilities.\\n\\nThe backpack is &#34;anti-theft&#34; because the pcokets are really hard to get into for pickpockets. The zippers are hidden and require effort to open... If someone attempts to open a zipper or go into a pocket, you'd definitely know. You have two deep side pockets for water bottles or anything else and the pockets are hidden from the back view. There is also a side zippered pocket on the back. That's where I kept my wallet and plane tickets. The zipper pocket in the front, I was a plbit worried it wasn't that &#34;anti theft&#34; like the other pockets since the zipper is visible, it's just tucked in so someone would have to really work the zipper out to open the pocket, so I only stashed invaluables in there like napkins and such.\\n\\nI liked that part of the backpack and it made me feel safer traveling around the city. The inside of the backpack was okay, I was able to fit my laptop, put it made the backpack too full. I definitely took it out at the hotel. Thanks to my handbag organizer I was able to keep my stuff pretty organized inside. There are pockets inside as well I was able to utilize.  The backpack felt pretty sturdy as well and my items inside did not get wet due to all the snow and sleet outside.\\n\\nI wasn't too thrilled about the charging capability, one of the main reasons I purchased this backpack. The charger SUCKED! It never charged my phone! It was very weak power. It comes with a power cord that you connect to your charger inside  the backpack, then you hook up another cord to the backpack charging port to charge your phone.  Also the placement of the charging port is a bit awkward and made using my phone weird.  I discovered I could remove the power cord it came with and possibly could replace it with my own, I'll have to see how that goes. It is also not as roomy as I would have liked it to be.\\n\\nOverall I liked the backpack based on the anti theft capabilities. It's good for travel if you're traveling light and also bring your own charging cables","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+wQtMeqkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+wQtMeqkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+wQtMeqkL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712ElXUWKNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712ElXUWKNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712ElXUWKNL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718so5iCgVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718so5iCgVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718so5iCgVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7199uPKARwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7199uPKARwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7199uPKARwL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H2ydbZTJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H2ydbZTJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H2ydbZTJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71IOw7zzwxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71IOw7zzwxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71IOw7zzwxL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OqTvXL06L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OqTvXL06L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OqTvXL06L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vLJhm7ugL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vLJhm7ugL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vLJhm7ugL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QKWWNrVpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QKWWNrVpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QKWWNrVpL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B072ZXD8LD","B09824VB51","AGEAKKRHOMULFMZSGECGGAG2MPKA","2017-12-21 15:36:12.502","9","True","506"
"692628","3","Dont be fooled by the spec sheet, its a cool box but the throughput isn't the best.","This was purchased when I still had a 200 Mbps ISP connection, and I was pretty happy with it for the most part. I know I would be upgrading to 1Gbps in the near future, and according to the specs it could handle it. The site claims 3Gbps, but thats under certain (ideal usually) test conditions but I am basically just using this as a router so barely any features are enabled and I found I was being bottlenecked by this device.\\n\\nFirst off, the setup is kind of a pain. I have an existing Ubiquiti controller, AP and POE switch on a non-default IP range. The USG comes on a default 192.168.x.x range, and you cannot reconfigure it until you join the controller. But you cannot join the controller until you put it on the same subnet as the controller. Long story short, I did some reading and found there is no easy solution. I did a dance with standing up a 2nd controller temporarily and set the IP range then had to brute force join it to my main controller (it also kept trying to move back to the temporary controller). Unless you are setting the entire site up from defaults, putting this into an existing setup is not the most friendly. In hindsight, you can go into the CLI and try to change the IP manually but that needs a serial cable and direct access to it. I also was reading where users at the same problem where it would still reset back to the default.\\n\\nThen when I upgraded to a 1 Gbps ISP connection, I was maxing out at ~600Mbps. I figured it was just because the rate wasn't guaranteed by the provider. Just for kicks, I bypassed this and got the full 1 Gbps. I began reading, and sure enough even just as a router with minimal features Users have said this thing can barely do 1 Gbps. I upgraded the firmware (which admittedly I should have done already) and I was able to get more or less 1 Gbps.\\n\\nI havent dabbled with many of the features such as the site to site VPN or any other tunneling, but the moral of the story is this guy has features but not throughput. I am not shocked by that as it is pretty cheap, but the spec sheet claimed otherwise. I would not buy this if I had to do it over again knowing the speeds I wanted to handle.","[]","B00LV8YZLK","B07ZFKHTCV","AFEOEZW4XUT2HDCK244QUGAU67TQ","2017-08-08 16:48:47.714","3","True","506"
"796014","5","Absolutely amazing graphics card, well worth the price!","I purchased the boost clock 1835 MHz version of this graphics card and could not be happier with my purchase. I will not have to upgrade my card for a very, very long time. I currently have a Ryzen 5 1600 cpu with 16GB 3200 DDR4 RAM to go with the gpu.\\n\\nPros:\\n- (Cooling) The cooling on this thing is amazing. I have an open case with good airflow, but had issues with cooling on my previous card. Even running a full stress test, this thing never got over 78 C. It usually runs about 65C - 70C in most games on Ultra settings.\\n- (Noise) Even with the amazing cooling, this thing runs very quiet compared to other cards I've used. It's slightly audible when not using headphones, but even then it's barely a distraction. My tower sits right next to me and I'm very happy with the noise level of the fans, even when they're running high speed.\\n- (Drivers and RGB) The drivers are incredibly easy to download and the software to change the RGB is very easy to use. The lighting on this unit looks beautiful and you can even customize it to change and react to audio playing on your computer. I have an RGB build and this was a fantastic addition to my build.\\n- (Performance) I cannot be happier with the performance of this gpu. There's a reason it's such a popular card: this thing is a BEAST. I play games like the Witcher 3 and Overwatch on Ultra settings (1440/144Hz) and have never dipped under 60FPS. In Overwatch, I average ~200 FPS and the Witcher ~80 FPS. I plan to overclock the card later, so this is with base clock.\\n\\nCons:\\n- (Price) Currently while writing this review we are amidst the cryptocurrency mining hype, and gpus are both hard to find and incredibly expensive as a result. I luckily purchased mine before Amazon went out of stock, but I would not pay more than $600 for this card. I've seen it as high as $780 and that is honestly just a ridiculous price. If it's that high, be patient. For that price you may as well invest in a 1080ti.\\n\\nI have attached photos of my build so you can see the RGB of the card, and will post performance benchmarks later.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bn0Hz7lTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bn0Hz7lTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bn0Hz7lTL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Mr88y059L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Mr88y059L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Mr88y059L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01K5F8MJK","B01JBD39EA","AHAYF6DPKWNUSH5LNRDQKDRGIPOQ","2017-08-09 18:28:07.527","3","True","506"

"719440","5","Solid and working well, as expected for a WD 3.5"" drive","I recently lost a PC, and am going through a technology upgrade cycle, and wanting to have data redundancy and convenient clones of hard drives to test under various scenarios (different PC's, docks, cloning hardware and software, OS's, etc.)\\n\\nSo, I recently bought four of these (One from Amazon, and three from another PC vendor). All four worked as expected right out of the box, taking nearly a 1 TB of Windows 7 OS and user data from other PC's via various drive cloning processes, and then showing up as expected and letting me acess and update the data just fine.\\n\\nThe drives seem to run reasonably cool, and are fairly quiet (considering I'm running them in external open SATA docks for now), and the speed is fine.  Just what I'd expect from a modern WD drive.\\n\\nI don't take chances with my data, so am happy to pay the premium for the WD black technology and reputation vs., say the WD blue.  I can't report on reliability/durability yet, since I've had these drives less than a week.\\n\\nIf I have problems worth noting, I'll plan to post updates.\\n\\nIn my experience (from memory), over the past 20+ years, I've had a LOT of experience with roughly 30 WD drives.  All consumer drives, size ranging from about a GB to 4 TB.\\n\\nI've had only two problems.  One was completely my fault.  Back in the day when they sealed the drives with some kind of rubber gasket, I tore a small section of that removing a drive from a desktop case the first time.  (Not a HW guy -- didn't know what I was doing).  That drive crashed in a few days -- which again was COMPLETELY my fault as air (with hair, dust, etc) got in there for awhile.\\n\\nI had another drive start making noises and refusing to accept a full hard drive clone via Partition Magic version 8.X -- probably in the early 2000's.  Again, not wanting to fool around with my data, I quit using that drive.  The main reason I've stuck with WD is the drives seem to be very solid and perform consistently.  I've use lots of both bare OEM and full retail kit WD drives, depending on prices/convenience.","[]","B00FJRS6FU","B09VS4V18K","AEXA46R7EKGETAWGR2MUMR5CIXYA","2017-06-03 16:35:02.000","2","True","506"
"591749","5","IT IS PERFECT!!!","This thing saved my life. I ordered a [[ASIN:B077F84Q4D Atoparts Smart Wi-Fi Light Switch Switch 2 Gang Wireless in Wall Glass]] from Amazon and found the description was incorrect as it was a dual switch that only fit a single gang. After much research, I found this and was exactly what was needed for this problem. It was hard to tell by the image and the description but I took a chance and ordered one and it was dead on what I needed.\\n\\nThe plate comes with all the screws you should need, and instructions on how to use it.  The default screws holes it has fit my switch as is, but you may need to punch out 4 more holes like I did so it can be screwed to the mounting box. In fact this is what the center round plastic part is for that can be removed. You use that part to help you punch out the holes around the edge, by placing it under the punch out locations you need and using a screw driver to press down and push out the plug. That is why it is there. (How many holes you pop out if any will depend on your mounting box and the device you are using).\\n\\nOnce I worked out what I needed to do with the plate, I reinstalled my switch with it and now it looks professional. The only real issue I ran into is if there are a lot of wires in the box and very little room, it can be very hard to get the device installed if the device has a big back, because of how thick the wires are. There is a lot force pushing against my switch making it bow out a little but it is not super noticeable.\\n\\nIf there is only one gripe I can give about this item, it would be the price. It is a tad high, but considering the compatibility it has, it is worth it. I have included several before and after pictures of the install I did and hopefully it will help someone else who is in the same situation.\\n\\nUpdate 01/06/2018: I actually ordered 2 of these at the same time expecting to use the another for another smart switch later but that did not happen. I later realized I could use it for my new thermostat to make it look much cleaner. I have included these pictures as well but unfortunately I do not have before pictures for it but you get the idea.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616ng1CihjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616ng1CihjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616ng1CihjL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619bcNEQWYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619bcNEQWYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619bcNEQWYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ENetwkVgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ENetwkVgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ENetwkVgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MbDyJAY7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MbDyJAY7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MbDyJAY7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TDxJFtseL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TDxJFtseL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TDxJFtseL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UPIATBvyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UPIATBvyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UPIATBvyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bjiZf42-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bjiZf42-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bjiZf42-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71boMkZ9dwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71boMkZ9dwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71boMkZ9dwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gsm8MbbsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gsm8MbbsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gsm8MbbsL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tuM6cUYiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tuM6cUYiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tuM6cUYiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B008MLS290","B008MLS290","AEKJIZVCH4Q2XCTRTHV5KFX2W5RQ","2017-12-26 17:43:54.906","10","True","506"
"704137","5","it seemed a little too good to be true","I wanted to see how these headphones held up before leaving an honest review, especially for the price, it seemed a little too good to be true. I've been using them for over a year and they've passed the test.\\nThese headphones do the job. They provide good audio sound and are well-made/sturdy. I love the case that it came with as well, it is very protective and comes in handy when travelling with these headphones. The noise cancelling capabilities aren't too bad either. It doesn't cancel out everything (which isn't realistic to expect with any headphone) but cancels out enough background noise. I use these very frequently (basically everyday) when studying and the headphones are still in good condition. They're not too heavy and don't get uncomfortable over extended periods of time. They're also comfortable enough to sleep in while travelling. I also like that I can enjoy music without the noise cancelling function on and it still sounds great, and when you turn the noise cancelling function on it enhances the sound. Plus the battery required for noise cancelling lasts a very long time.\\nI ran into a slight issue with them, but the Monoprice customer service team was very accommodating and helpful in resolving the issue.\\nThese are headphones that I would buy again.\\nThe only cons I've experienced with these headphones are that:\\n1. The remote doesn't work with my android device (no fault of their own, they state on the packaging that it only works with apple devices)\\n2. The ear cups are kind of bulky and not very stylish but I think it's all personal preference and probably me being picky, I mean it's not that bad, I still wear them all the time lol and it probably is what contributes to the noise cancelling function\\n3. It would be nice if they sold earpad replacements because they will eventually get worn out (I recommend buying earpad covers to protect them and extend their longevity)\\n4. Sound bleeding (I think that's inevitable with any headphone though, and it's only noticeable in very quiet environments on moderate to high volumes)\\n5. It's difficult to go back to other headphones, especially earbuds, after using these. The sound and noise cancelling function kind of spoil you and make it hard to downgrade to other audio headphones. It's definitely a different listening experience\\nHope this helps!","[]","B00D8HPYXA","B00D8HPYXA","AFKO2UV5ZINAVOGVFIWVZQK7RYOA","2017-10-06 04:26:22.031","4","True","506"
"888158","5","Life changer","I picked up a couple of these while at Lowe's before Christmas,  One for upstairs and one for downstairs. I already had two Bose Bluetooth speakers to Pair them to. The set up was a little more than I had bargained for, but Amazon help was very helpful.  A friend told me she had bought one and took it back because it did not have unique content. Oh boy, I am glad I did not listen to her. True, you can do just about anything Alexa can do some other way,  just not as conveniently, and some things you just would not do because they would be too much trouble.\\n\\n I can easily play just a couple of tunes when I am upstairs and then with a quick command, stop that, walk downstairs, and get her going again.  No fumbling with the radio,  tablet, or phone.\\n\\n I am especially enjoying listening to music I had practically forgotten. She is a good complement to Pandora because she can play music by the artist you specify, or even a specific song, instead of a genre like Pandora. Alexa will also play a mix of  Artists.  You do not have to own the music she plays. Sometimes I have her play bedtime music for example.  I will be happy when she stops mixing in holiday music. It seems most every artist has a holiday album.  However, you can tell her to skip anything you don't want to hear.\\n\\n I enjoy using her alarm settings because I can easily change them every night or even for a nap, a task that would be more time-consuming than it is worth on the clock radio.  It is easier to ask her for the time than to look at my bedside clock.\\n\\n For the news briefings,  she defaulted to NPR which I like, but then I discovered I can add local briefings.  She is good at keeping up with sports scores and can tell you when the games will be played, but she does not know on what network.\\n\\n It is fun to discover what she knows -  she knew all about full moons and waxing and waning.  She couldn't answer questions about current movies.  I love that she can  give me local phone numbers which are harder to find of the web these days. she always gives the number for the location nearest me.\\n\\nDefinitely a worthwhile purchase.","[]","B01DFKC2SO","B01K8B8YA8","AFHWVC2T7N2XCJM4V2BANGHRPLGQ","2017-01-07 19:10:06.000","0","True","506"

How do you know if the product functions correctly? How do you know how well its holds up?\\nI always try to do my research when buying products because I'm I'm disabled and I just can't afford to buy new stuff all the time, being on a fixed income has its limits. So I save for for things that I want and read reviews for EVERYTHING. And this product was no exception, well I can say that I am disappointed, about a week ago two of the keys at the bottom popped off, unfortunately it happens to be right after the time I am able to return the keyboard for another. I am still able to use it, but I don't think I would purchase this one again.\\nPros of this keyboard is it is light and compact, I don't find I need to charge it often and it fits my iPad Pro 9.7 well. Your Ipad does fort very snug inside so that is a pro as well.\\nCons it is very flimsly, if you have it sitting on your lap make sure to hold on to your ipad because any pressure and it will fall off or over. And the keyboard I have also noticed is losing its magnetic stay inside. I don't recommend taking your keyboard with you, this was disappointing to me because that is why I wanted this is the first place but with the keyboard being as flimsy as it is I just don't recommend it,\\nThis is one of the main reasons why I prefer to wait to review products such as this, I feel it is import to use the product and see how it actually holds up because after all how are we as consumers actually supposed to know if a product is good or not by reviewing it when we first get it? I don't feel it is right that so many manufacturers ask for a review right away, if it is something that we don't use like this sure, but something that we use that needs to stand the test of time the only way we can be sure that we are getting quality products we need to give it time or update reviews so consumers are educated on the best products possible.\\nThis in only my experience with this product, I am only one person. I hope my experience is not the norm, but I also hope that more people will update or wait to review their products.

"599692","4","Great keyboard; just wish the Fn and Ctrl were swapped; should install Logitech Options software","### WHY I BOUGHT IT ###\\n\\nI got this keyboard after hearing some really good reviews about the various Logitech BT / small format keyboards. I wanted a keyboard to use with a pair of Macbook Pros -- work and personal -- without having to disconnect one from a regular Apple wireless keyboard. I also wanted a keyboard that was known to work well with iOS devices -- in this case, an iPad Mini 2 Retina.\\n\\n### PROS ###\\n\\nThe keyboard is lightweight and not much bigger than an Apple wireless keyboard. It's lighter, I think, because it's a) not metal and b) using AAA batteries instead of AA batteries.\\n\\nThe pairing sequence is really easy. I connected my two Macbook Pros (work and personal) and an iPad Mini 2 Retina without a hitch. I've only had to re-pair the iPad once in about 3 weeks.\\n\\nThe on/off switch is nice for keeping from draining the battery.\\n\\n### CONS ###\\n\\nThe keyboard would be perfect for my Apple-centric needs IF the left Ctrl and Fn keys were swapped. I find myself searching for the Ctrl key and hitting the Fn key instead -- all the time.\\n\\nThe plastic construction makes it feel a bit flimsy. It doesn't have a lot of heft like an Apple wireless keyboard, BUT the cost of $28 makes up for it.\\n\\nYou really need to install the Logitech Options software (not Logitech Control Center) to make the most of the specific settings on this keyboard. You can control more than you can, and you can have it set up to show the caps lock state on screen vs. just guessing.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, the Caps Lock key could REALLY use a light to indicate on/off state. If you can add them to the 3 device specific connection buttons, you should be able to get a Caps Lock key light. Maybe it's to conserve battery power, but honestly, that would only affect someone who yells a lot in Internet comments.\\n\\n### SUMMARY ###\\n\\nThis is a great keyboard. I'm very happy with the purchase. If they revise it down the road to give it a little more heft and maybe swap those buttons, it'll be perfect.","[]","B0148NPH9I","B0BPN2DXC1","AF6OYQFKNHHPUQGJL3MYG6JNTAHA","2017-04-22 18:37:27.000","1","True","506"

It's always whirring and clicking away. At first it was pretty jarring, but I'm getting used to it. Now and again the noises are a little obnoxious, and pretty distracting. If you have a silent working environment, this may bother you (and likely your nearby co-workers) quite a bit.\\n- Included cable is 20 Gbps, not 40 Gbps. (You'll need a cable that is at / under .5 m and is a true TB3 cable in order to get 40 Gbps speeds).\\n- The USB-C port is only for connecting to a computer as an alternative method to Thunderbolt 3. You cannot use it as a hub for other USB-C devices. This is a bit of a bummer, but more of an &#34;I wish&#34; rather than a strike against it.\\n- You can only hook up this device to a single computer / workstation at a time (via the TB3 ports on the back).\\n- If you attempt to hook up a USB-C device / any TB3 device other than a computer to the TB3 ports on the back of the G-RAID, you will hear a high pitched squeal. It was very noticeable to me, and didn't sound right. I don't know if this is an issue with power delivery to the USB-C / TB3 device through the TB3 port or not. This part really stinks. Unless the TB3 port on the G-RAID leads to something that is actively consuming a lot of power (a computer, for example), the squeal will occur the moment it is plugged in and continue until it is unplugged. I have an external SSD that produces this issue each and every time I attempt to plug it in to the 2nd TB3 port (the other goes directly to my computer).","[]","B072HS2CJN","B08Z8VBSXP","AFBG7MSNBIEG5G4HZ74UOZ7MHZ3Q","2017-07-26 05:22:44.505","95","True","506"

No way to give the 5Ghz network a different SSID or prefer it in any way.  No port forwarding or firewall rules.  Very little that can be done.  Luckily the Netgear software I have installed on my primary PC allows me to choose which band to connect on.\\n2. No web interface either.  It all has to be done through the app.\\n3. The device also only has one input port and one output port, compared to the normal 4 outputs that you'll find on a typical router so if this is your primary router and you want multiple devices hardwired, you'll need to invest in a separate ethernet switch.\\n\\nOverall I'd say I'm happy with it.  It is lacking features and will likely disappoint power users.  At the same time it's super easy to use and seems solid so it will likely work just fine for the majority of the folks who buy it.  I'm running it side-by-side with another wireless network and have all the features I need there so it's easier for me to forgive.  I do think it's a good first step into the space and hope that Samsung improves the next iteration.","[]","B06XSDFMND","B06Y3D3FMW","AGGX6N2TTE5FA33IDYNPEJAKITEA","2017-08-21 19:46:49.379","6","False","506"
"126560","4","J-tech saves the day!!","I bought last year's model and it did not work. I then called in to J-Tech and they told me to buy new 2017 model. I bought that and it still did not work. I became very frustrated and reached out to the DVD player manufacturer Oppo Digital. They recommended I buy Pixelgen cables since I was running a 50 feet cable from my Oppo UDP-203 4K Blu-ray around the wall to my JVC front Projector DLA-RS540U. So I called and talked to Pixelgen and they told me from their experience, I have to use a passive 50 ft cable. They they carry such a compatible cable to mate with the JVC. I ordered it. waited anxiously for roughly four days for Fedex to deliver. Then it showed up on my front door. The installer and I hooked the cable from the Oppo to the projector and ....It works...!!! That was a snapshot of my ordeal in this two month's worth of  this install .\\n\\nIn summary:\\nIf you have to run a 25 to 50 feet cable from a 4K source to a front projector, you will save a lot of money and time by buying this J-tech repeater COUPLED with the $100 Pixelgen high-grade passive cable to transfer the 4K images to the 4K compliant\\nfront projector. You turn on the source components first and turn the front projector LAST for them to shake hands. BTW, I bought the front screen from Amazon also, the STR silver ticket 4K 120 inches grey material for $300. This screen is even watchable in moderate ambient lighting. I am very satisfied with this screen. Don't waste your money with those 2 to $4000 screens until you try this first. i wouldn't have believed it until I have been watching it for the past three four months.\\n\\n I have thoroughly enjoyed my theater setup. The picture and joy have been worth the money, time and effort putting this theater room/smoking room together. I am also glad to have gone with the JVC even though it is expensive. But every time I fire up this system, I am glad I went with the JVC. But..., without the J-tech Repeater, I would have to spend $700 or so getting those 4K images transmitted from the Oppo to the JVC.\\n\\nHighly, highly recommended.","[]","B01HQQHOB8","B01HQQHOB8","AEJR7JB7CUPDR74FC6MJ47UK7URA","2017-11-08 01:53:30.276","1","True","506"
"964156","1","POOR CONNECTIVITY = FRUSTRATION","I am deeply disappointed at these earbuds. Jaybirds was my first wireless headphones when the whole wireless earbuds thing began and I got plenty of love from them. So I didn't hesitate to buy these despite the many reviews of extremely poor connectivity issues. I own a wireless earbuds ranging from the $10 beater ones to the $300 Bose, I even own the Apple Airpods as well, so I feel confident that this particular earbuds are pretty disappointing. These wireless headphones are not even ready to be released to the public due to the many bugs it has, specifically the connection. My LEFT earbuds are always losing connection. I turn slightly to an angle and it drops. I pick up my phone to place it to my right side, which is what they recommended, and its still loses connection. I blink my eyes and it loses connection, and I'm not exaggerating. Its really that bad. Sometimes it even drops connection to both earbuds. If you buy these now, you will spend a lot of your time picking up your phone and moving it around just so this POS can connect again. For being more expensive than the Apple Airpods, this shouldn't happen. Even the cheapo $10 beaters never loses connection even when I'm halfway around the gym.\\n\\nI don't think Jaybirds are going to be able to fix this issue with an update, it seems that what you get is what you get type of situation. I am really disappointed, and I have learned an expensive lesson. Shell up some more cash and just buy a Bose, or just stick with what you have, but definitely stay away from this product. If you are in the fence between this and something else, pick something else, trust me and you'll save yourself some money and frustration.\\n\\nAside from the connection issues, one thing Jaybirds also mentioned is that you have the ability to launch Siri or Google Assistant. However, they didnt mention that if you have an iPhone, your stuck with Siri and there is no way to switch. Jaybird support recommended that I reach out to Apple and have them make that change. WTF? I didn't pay for overpriced headphones so that I will fix your product's shortcomings. Just goes to show that Jaybirds will never fix any of the issues just because of that attitude.\\n\\nAnywho, point is, STAY AWAY!!","[]","B07582VVJR","B075P4CD9W","AGFSWKJHDSPYPAZNRFLVPKBJB6RQ","2017-12-13 12:50:55.980","1","False","506"

I soon discovered that this was a horrible choice. The computer seemed to work nicely for about 3 weeks, then the track pad stopped working. This was annoying, but I had a mouse on hand for her to use. She used the computer for a bout 2 weeks with the mouse and the performance of the computer consistently got worse and worse. Finally, when it could not open up google in under 5 minutes and the screen would go black randomly in roughly 10 minute intervals, I sent it in for service.\\n\\nAfter describing all issues with the representative, in about 2 weeks I received the computer back, the description of what they did included: replace track pad. I was frustrated because there were more issues going on, but they seemingly did not look into anything other than the track pad.\\n\\nI tried to log into her Microsoft 365 account and the computer shut off. I rebooted it, and it was extremely slow.\\n\\nI decided to send it back to Acer once more. This time I asked the representative to put in a special request to call me before sending the computer back in order to discuss what was done with the computer.\\n\\nNearly 3 weeks later, I got an email stating that the computer was shipped back, so I promptly called the repair center. Essentially the repair center said that they could not find anything wrong with the computer. I asked the representative what they did to check the computer and she said that only a technician could tell me the answer. I explained that I requested a courtesy call and she told me that the technicians never speak with the customer. I explained that it was ridiculous that there are questions that only technicians could answer but technicians do not answer questions.\\n\\nFinally the computer has returned from repair for a second time, this time nothing was done. At this point, the computer refuses to update the version of Windows, and I am dreading having to send the computer back to customer repair that apparently does very little.\\n\\nI am extremely dissatisfied with Acer's customer care. I was sent a dud, and am having an INCREDIBLY difficult time trying to get this issue taken care of.","[]","B01K1IO3QW","B01K1IO3QW","AE2CGQC6J2CA3VNPKUTSHPWJHDKQ","2017-05-22 01:27:32.000","4","False","506"

I would not want to plug and unplug this cable daily from such a nice phone. Plugging the cable into the phone is somewhat difficult and a little uncomfortable, but unplugging it requires literally yanking it out hard as you can.\\n\\nI have 4 Samsung OEM cables: the cable that came with the phone, two cables that came with a Samsung charging kit, and the adapter for micro USB cables that also came with the phone. All four of these fit the Samsung S8 plus very comfortably. You don't have to push them in too hard, and when they are inserted all the way, there's a nice satisfying click that you hear, and once you hear that, you know it's secure and it's not going to fall out without intentionally trying to remove it.\\n\\nThe reason I'm giving them two stars instead of just one is because, as type c becomes more popular,  I'm sure there will be other products that I value less that may have looser standards that I may be able to use these for. They are of good build,  and possibly durable, but it's the durability of my phone that I'm more concerned about. For the Samsung S8 plus, this was my experience:\\n\\nI attempted 3 tries to get the cables to work.\\n\\n1a. I thought the cables were really loose. I was wrong. I just hadn't jammed them in enough.\\n1b. After jamming it in, I plugged the other end into an OEM fast adaptive charger and plugged it in. Nothing for a few  seconds followed by a notification on my phone that there was a slight connection issue with my USB cable and it said it was slow charging. I'd never seen this message before.\\n2. Same cable, but flipped the type c end around (shouldn't be needed) jammed it in, fast charge.\\n3. Second cable and result as above.\\n\\nProblem is, by the third time, I felt like I could be damaging my phone. It seemed to get harder and harder to remove.\\n\\nSo, after this learning experience I think I'm going to be sticking with Samsung cables because, unfortunately, don't seem up to part.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31BediQxHxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31BediQxHxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31BediQxHxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/415BrpwX-5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/415BrpwX-5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/415BrpwX-5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ea9ceA6+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ea9ceA6+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ea9ceA6+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51RAutMRdWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51RAutMRdWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51RAutMRdWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619mPlT7tNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619mPlT7tNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619mPlT7tNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71y0EgV-xVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71y0EgV-xVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71y0EgV-xVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816n7aUSrcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816n7aUSrcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816n7aUSrcL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B071DGLFKH","B071DGLFKH","AHJKKLI3RJ5LNR4BTLSA64UMSPZA","2017-05-09 01:27:41.000","2","True","506"

For this audio upgrade, added a Pioneer GM-9500F 4ch amp,GM-9601 mono amp, AudioControl's LC7i L.O.C, with this sub in a DIY 1.5cu.ft ported enclosure. Sub is wired in parallel for 2ohms. Mono amp cutoff freq set to 60Hz, gain setting at 'H' mark(4V input). LOC's accubass control knobsL Threshold at 10 o'clock, Level at 12 o'clock. HU volume typically around 12/40, for me is loud enough but definitely not wake-the-dead loud cuz I treasure my ears. Monoamp comes with a bass level control knob installed near driver's seat.\\n\\nNot going into SPL competition or heavy-bass-driven songs - Listening to anime, retro, metal rock and radio.  Delivered bass is rich, full and deep w/o any buzz/distortion. Did not hear any panels rattling. This sub makes good songs sound Great, crappy songs sound good. Even when my car reached destination I still linger in my seat for few minutes to enjoy the music, hesitant to get out.\\n\\nWhen music is playing and I look at the sub, can see the cone vibrate but not in the manner seen in youtube with crazy excursion, lots of buzzing with panels and windshields vibrating. I don't understand why bass freaks even consider this 'good bass'. What's the f****g point in a bass-driven song when the bass overwhelms the song itself?? In my case, each bass note hits strong and clean without buzz, vibrating panels or distortion. I use the remote control knob to tune the amount of bass needed to complement the song as my mp3s come from various sources - I don't want and don't need overwhelming bass.\\n\\nPreviously had a pioneer TS-SW2501S2 10&#34; shallow mount sub but its bass doesn't go as deep as this TS-W3003D4. If you want to get a sub, do yourself justice and get a full-sized sub and not those shallow-mount types unless really have space constraints.

"78496","3","Okay but needs much improvement","I wanted to rate this higher. The video capture quality even on low was acceptable and the ability to capture off a blu-ray player, a chromecast and a Cisco CHS33HDCP2  was great.\\n\\nHowever, any suggestion that this actually has acceptable performance with an NTFS formatted drive is laughable. In my case, the NTFS file system was corrupted before the Kingston 32GB drive could receive it's capacity of around 6 hours. All files lost and drive inaccessible, requiring a reformat. I certainly would be thinking twice before connecting this to my PC's NTFS formatted drives using the Helper program. They say to use the MP4 Cloner to stitch things back together (a free download for owners) with the multiple FAT32 sized clips but that's a lot of extra effort that shouldn't be necessary if there was actually useable NTFS support.. The MP4 Cloner program worked well at combining the clips as near as I could tell but it's use for trimming is completely handicapped by the lack of frame accurate trimming. You see it only counts minutes and seconds but not frames meaning trims occur somewhere (beyond your control) within the 30 frames that are recorded every second resulting in a very rough cut that's basically un-useable.\\n\\nBesides the poor NTFS support, the HDML-Cloner box firmware is non-functional in some areas, like scheduling that didn't run on the schedule I set up the time that I tried it, for the once occurring event I wanted to record. Fortunately, since it was the first time trying the scheduling, I was present to manually start the recording.\\n\\nSome areas I'd like to see additionally improved include 1080p/60 recording support, support for 5.1 audio and HD audio, and a power off pass-through of the input signal so the box doesn't have to be fully energized all the time.\\n\\nIn summary, while this device records acceptably, it's support for NTFS is lacking and the firmware is immature and not fully functional. I can only recommend this if you only need basic recording ability and don't mind the raft of FAT32 files.\\nUpdate: I've removed the HDML Cloner Box Pro Helper software after experiencing mouse freezes. It appears this software doesn't handle the Windows 10 USB properly either. The freezes stopped after removal.","[]","B012T1D0IG","B012T1D0IG","AHXN7OW4M5LPG7OS2SDGQKTKLH7A","2017-12-27 03:18:27.683","1","True","506"

It sits there, ever faithful, just waiting for me to pull a product from the cupboard, realize it is the last one, then either add it to the shopping list we use to go to the store, or to go ahead and order it directly from Amazon. You really can't get much more convenient than that, especially as our minds aren't quite as sharp as they used to be (well we do have 2 young kids....)\\n\\nWe have three more in the bedrooms, they are used for playing music (built in speaker is more than adequate for our daughters audio needs, plus they both love talking to Alexa and having complete control of what they listen to) they also are being used for alarms (useful on school-day mornings!) and our 5 year old has been probing Alexa to answer some of the questions that pop into her head about various subjects (the meaning of life, quantum mechanics, M-theory, who is the guy dressed in the Barney suit, etc...) We have one in our bedroom for the same reasons, but also use the Bluetooth option to switch between playing music in the bedroom and the bathroom while taking a shower (just turning the Bluetooth speaker on in the bathroom moves the audio playback from the Dot to the speaker in the bathroom, then back to the dot again after the speaker is turned off again) so the music follows us wherever we may roam.\\n\\nOur latest addition to the Dot family resides in our dining room, we like to have some music in the background while we eat, and the Dot covers this role nicely also.\\n\\nExcellent little gizmo's and, i am sure, will multiply again as soon as we discover a &#34;need&#34; to have one of these in a different room in the house.

She didn't want boxes and wires everywhere. I built a home made equipment rack, and rigged up a ventilation system with a AC adapter and a bunch of computer fans. It was ugly but worked- kind of, until my Reciever died. Turned out it was a systemic problem with Onkyo AVRs, but it just emphasized the need for good ventilation. At the time there really wasn't much out there, and what was there was way overpriced for well packaged computer case fans.\\n\\nFast forward, new theater setup. Components in a dedicated equipment room, lots of passive ventilation but I've always wondered if I shouldn't get a USB fan or two for my AMP and AVR. Then I found those fans. They look great. Seem solidly built, and are no-fuss in the setup. I peek in on them to time to time and they fire up after the equipment has been on for a few minutes. The tops of the components are nice and cool. They never got hot before but I would always check with my hand after a movie and they would be warm.\\n\\nDo I need them? Not sure, according to the manuals I have adequate ventilation space around each component, but cooler is better. These certainly don't hurt and they give me some piece of mind I'm doing what I can to preserve my investment. They are quiet, but you could probably hear them on high if you're in the same room as your equipment- but then again at that point you should be listening to a movie/TV show and I doubt you'd hear them over content.\\n\\nThey move enough air I haven't seen them running full speed yet on the smart/auto setting where it dials up speed based on temp.\\n\\nI wish I had access to some of their other cabinet based products 5 years ago.\\n\\nTwo features I'd like to see:\\n12volt trigger.

Luckily the mouse can be used while its charging, but it would be nice to have a notification pop up when the battery is running low.\\n- - - Another negative is that the scroller gets very dirty and is nearly impossible to clean. The grippiness is provided by rubber placed in the shape of gears. But the gear shape and the stickiness of the rubber attract dirty and oils from your hands making it pretty unsightly. It doesn't affect performance so far, and its by no means disgusting, but It does detract from the professional and sleek look and feel of the mouse..","[]","B00TZR3WRM","B00TZR3WRM","AHPHH2XHHRROHZ5WWGC6EW2MUD6Q","2017-03-31 15:26:38.000","0","True","506"

The first time, we went on vacation and used them to be able to peek in at our dog, who was being cared for by family members... just because we loved and missed him. They worked great! Then, we reset the cameras to use them at home. That's when it all went bad. The Wifi Hub just wouldn't pair to the app, no matter how many times we unplugged and reset the hub, the cameras, uninstalled and reinstalled the app. It just wasn't working anymore, so we returned them. At that time, I would have given them two stars... but I was not so good at rating things.\\n\\nThis is the second time we have purchased these, to keep an eye on our home when we are away. One cool thing about these cameras is that you can remotely arm and disarm them from the companion app, regardless of where you are, as long as you have an internet connection. Additionally, the updated Blink app allows you to adjust a multitude of different settings: clip length, re-trigger time, motion detector sensitivity... there's even a Beta functionality for Temperature, which can give you a push notification if the temperature in a room falls outside of a range you get to specify. In our specific situation, we were using one camera to keep an eye on our aging dog, and it really helped knowing the temperature in a specific room (which was air-conditioned), so we could tell if there were brown-outs happening in the summer heat and come home to bring our dog to our local air-conditioned beer bar.\\n\\nThese cameras are extremely cool and versatile, and unlike other competitor options, these cameras do not require a monthly subscription to use and record video (looking at you [[ASIN:B01645FHFC Logitech Circle Wireless 1080p Video Battery Powered Security Camera with Person Detection, Motion Zones and Custom Alerts (Black)]] ... a 90 day free trial, followed by a monthly subscription to record video clips). There are even IFTT scripts you can run that allow you to automate the arming and disarming of cameras, based on your phone's geolocation.\\n\\nThese cameras are extremely cool and extremely simple to setup, I'm glad we gave them another shot. I didn't even talk about the fact that they are very compact and battery operated, but that's just an added bonus.","[]","B019S3ULQM","B019S3ULQM","AEDLGYAIZCIKF752E6T2PELQGA4Q","2017-07-04 05:28:00.106","292","True","506"

My previous LG 27&#34; IPS looks exactly like this one, and it lasted about 3 years and 9 months. I hope this one lasts longer than my previous one.  We have cheap old monitors around the house that are 8-10 years old, and still work like new, so here's hoping.\\n\\nLikes: *Text is jet black and very smooth and sharp.

Good news is, the anti-glare is semi-glossy.\\n  *Having to fiddle with Windows 10 to get the text and icon sizes right.\\n  *LG software is just plain awful. No way to flash the firmware, GUI is so tiny I can't read it. Really LG?\\n\\nAll in all, a very nice monitor, but a little pricey.

I own a pair of Gascans that I've had for almost eight years and they are my favorite pair of sunnies. Wanted something now that I'm starting to run more and the sun can sometimes cause a harsh glare.\\nSo nice sunglasses with the ability to track my exercises? Sure; why not.\\n\\nAs sunglasses they fit a bit loose on my head, but with the same material that I used on my Gascans I was able to make them tighter by fitting some foam on the hinges; this way they wouldn't (and didn't) loosen while running.\\nThey fit great and are an excellent addition to my running routine. The sun isn't as vibrant as of this writing, but I will continue to use these throughout the winter as the sun's glare on the snow will be an issue.\\n\\nI tried these on without the smart devices enabled at first to get an idea as to how the sunglasses were by themselves. The box comes with all the electronics apart from the glasses, and the glasses come in a nice semi-hard shell with the additional lens inside. I then equipped everything in one bout.\\n\\nThe earphones fit okay, but they did tend to slide out at times during the few times I've used this so far while running. No issue in terms of when I'm in the gym, however. Syncing from my phone has never been an issue, though I hate carrying it with me.\\n\\nAs smartglasses, they're okay; nothing revolutionary, and it's up to you if you want to pay the premium price for something your phone already can do, provided you take it with you. As the coach doesn't do as much as I'd like as of this writing, as I already have most of my workouts set. I suppose it may not be entirely geared for me as the only exercise I do outdoors is running; the rest is all in the gym.\\n\\nThe music does tend to cut in and out, and I wound up just shutting it off completely after a while. I may look into more comfortable replacements, too.\\n\\nAs sunglasses, these are phenomenal. The perfect sunnies for triathlons, methinks (when they're not wet). But as for smartglasses, a novel idea but needs improvement.","[]","B01LZAMLM9","B01MYWX7AM","AEUAL3EJKUSTNB4YY6STLYGTJALA","2017-11-10 23:18:30.367","0","False","506"
"731345","5","THE PERFECT MINI SPEAKER","Wow. I don't even know where to start.\\n\\nI have the Harman/kardon Onyx 3, I have had it for 3 Years. It produces enough sound to rock an entire house party. but It is huge, the charger is impossible and hard to carry around, and the stands broke off so it can no longer be used properly. but it is still louder than all the others at work.\\n\\nSo When I saw they had a Mini version of my favorite speaker, I had to get it. The size is about 1/3 the size of the original Onyx 3. It also use Micro USB to charge, so as long as I have a phone charger, I have music power.\\n\\nThe sound quality and Bass are simply beautiful. You feel the music. unlike its bigger brother, the mini has conference call capabilities. It also has the ability to pair with a second mini to produce surround sound and dual stereo.\\n\\nThe stand on the mini is unbreakable and way more sturdy.\\n\\nThe mini also has a battery indicator unlike the bigger model. So you will always know how much battery power you have left. The battery seems to last quite a long time. at least over 6 hours. The box it comes in doubles as a carrying case.\\n\\nIt even has a mini sub woofer in back that really bumps the bass. bass on mini speakers in general is usually awful, but this mini just bumps. It wont be enough for a full house party, but it will fill a single room with concert level music.\\n\\nperfect for a kickback. 3 people can connect at once and take turns playing songs. in all fairness I spent money on the speaker so I should be controlling all the music, but its a cool feature.\\n\\nAlso unlike the bigger one, this mini comes with an Aux port. So those older phones and ipods can still be connected with lack of bluetooth. plus some of us think that AUX sounds better than Bluetooth.\\n\\nLastly it has a beautiful connecting sound, letting you know when you are connected or disconnected. you can also control the music on your phone with the controls on the top of the speaker.\\n\\nCheck out my pictures. I show a comparison between the Onyx 3 and the New Onyx Mini I just received.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OeNX2wVyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OeNX2wVyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OeNX2wVyL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SVpdMhJsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SVpdMhJsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SVpdMhJsL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81nCIrwIHeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81nCIrwIHeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81nCIrwIHeL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qFax9kOOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qFax9kOOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qFax9kOOL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01MSHLOFG","B01MSHLOFG","AEI4ETMT7QPQONFOUC3S5CYY2CGA","2017-09-06 19:23:20.921","154","True","506"
"350977","5","Long Overdue Upgrade","Bought this to replace an aging GTX760 and the only regret is that I didn't do it sooner.  Compared several versions of this card on a handful of sites and read forums as well. Ultimately I chose the Gigabyte because I run a Gigabyte Mobo and have been well pleased with it's performance and reliability, and it has the extra cooling capacity which is important for where my computer sits and what I run on it.\\n\\nInstallation was seamless, and the gaming performance improvement is noticeable.\\n\\nI also run BOINC and the calculation results increased over 100% increase in performance in a few days and was still climbing before I added new projects to work on.  The CUDA calculations have a huge impact and allow me to crunch projects specifically designed for cards with this technology.  Even running all CPU(i7) and GPU cores at 100% capacity the temperatures stay within a good operating range.\\n\\nThe only blip in all of this, which, so far as I can tell doesn't affect what I want to do with the card, is the AORUS graphics software that installed with the card.  It's kind of buggy and kept crashing over the first few days after install.  Once I looked over what the software was doing I decided I didn't need it to autoload, so I disabled it.  Figure if I need it, I'll start it then.\\n\\nThe price per performance ratio is excellent.\\n\\nAfter running this card for three months now I am still satisfied with it.  A few updates:  Have experienced an occasional driver crash, which the system generally recovers from, though it has on a few instances also corrupted the data set BOINC was crunching.  As for the Aorus software - it's crap!  I upgraded to the latest version (1.26) and the experience has been horrible.  From the point I installed it I got the dreaded Blue Screen of Death.  Over the course of 3 days after install I got more BSDs (at least five). Even uninstalled and reinstalled and it still craters my system.  I cannot recommend the software, and without it, adjusting the card appears to not be possible.  Maybe when another version comes out, I'll try again and hope it doesn't tank my system.  Fan of the card, not the software application that comes with it.","[]","B075FTH3G7","B075FTH3G7","AHOAKKPM3D2F7LF4ZIQMNXLSV5KQ","2017-11-03 01:46:46.921","31","True","506"
"968186","5","I was nervous that it would be gimmicky just like when I had a smartwatch","So I finally caved and got myself a speaker I could talk to. I'm a diehard Google fan and it was hard for me to decide between this and Google Home, but my curiosity in Amazon world of branded technology had me ultimately sold. I was nervous that it would be gimmicky just like when I had a smartwatch, something that I just never found all that useful or intriguing than just pulling out my phone.\\n\\nLet me start off by saying that white was an excellent color choice. Sleek, modern, and with enough appeal to stand out in an attractive way. Setup was simple and I was ready to go in just a few minutes after unboxing. So I hit Alexa with all the things I had been begging to see her do. She played many of the songs I asked her to play (I've yet to upgrade to Prime Unlimited), and will shuffle many of the artists I ask her to. This is my primary use for my Echo, as it is located in my kitchen and while I work I'll ask her to play whatever music I'm in the mood for and away I go. If i'm indecisive, I ask her to play something and she makes a reasonably educated guess.\\n\\nI ask about the weather. I ask about my daily news briefing. If I hear a song I've never heard before, I ask her to add it to my library. I ask her to play my local NPR station. I ask her to play my hometown radio. I ask for the latest TED talk. Whenever I'm in my home, my Echo is in use and always coming in handy. The other day, I needed cooking measurements and knew Alexa was there for it. I was happy to discover that this expensive little tool was actually not a gimmick and something that really has become something I use everyday.\\n\\nMy roommates made fun of me initially, shouting nonsense at my Echo and purposefully making fun of the fact that I was talking to my technology. You'd be surprised to find that now I wake up every morning to hear them upstairs asking Alexa about the weather, see what's going on in the news, and play them music. I guess it wasn't so bad after all.\\n\\nI will be soon moving my Echo to my room and buying an Echo Show to go in my kitchen. I'll be getting Dots for my entire apartment and I will be fully embracing the fun Im having!","[]","B01E6AO69U","B01KIOU214","AGWB57FUE7PSTIR2UZIDFSPC2HPA","2017-05-12 02:30:53.000","3","True","506"
"104965","2","Overall it is a disappointment. Apple seems to have taken a few steps ...","I've been using this MacBook for about a month. I have used it for some web design, multimedia, presentations and college course work. I have the 15.4 inch version with touch bar, 2.6GHz Core i7, and 256 GB of space. The computer has frozen up on me twice, each time just for a few minutes. One multimedia program has crashed and lost data once. The touch bar has been of very little use but is convenient at times.\\nNegatives:\\nThe biggest negative besides the colossal price for me is the short battery life. I only get a few hours out of it before I have to plug in. Very disappointing. The thunderbolt charging cable that came with the computer is a bit short and inconvenient. The lack of ports and having to use a few different dongles has been a major inconvenience. The dongles are for sale at price gouging rates right now. At the least, Apple should have included a dongle with an HDMI, ethernet and USB port with the purchase. The screen is slightly brighter than older versions but is still inadequate for use in the bright sun. The screen is also too reflective and is hard on the eyes if you have bright lights behind you. The keyboard is very loud as well which has prevented me from using it in the classroom as the keyboard is disruptively loud. The computer has been kept very clean but the trackpad has gotten stuck in the clicked position on a few occasions already.\\n\\nPositives: It is somewhat reliable and has been able to preform most tasks I asked of it. Charges fairly quick, probably due to the very small capacity of the battery. Touch ID and the Touch Bar are convenient at times but not worth the massive price paid for them. The size of the Trackpad is convenient as long as it is working properly.\\n\\nOverall it is a disappointment. Apple seems to have taken a few steps backward on this one and is caring more about pushing the consumer to buy other MacBook compatible devices with bluetooth and Airdrop. Hopefully Apple starts caring about their customers and their productivity more than their company bottom line or I will have to go back to a windows computer. I recommend that you either buy an older MacBook, buy a windows computer that is cheaper, more powerful and more compatible with everything or wait for the next MacBook Pro release and see if Apple has their act together on that one.

"613365","1","Linksys hasn't changed - still sucks","Router sucks, just like my last Linksys router.  We had one a couple of years ago that after a while, would require a manual reset (go downstairs, unplug it, plug it back in).  I replaced it with another brand, and it was time to upgrade again.  I liked the look of the Linksys mobile app for control of the router - managing devices, parental control, monitoring activity, WPS connect, guest network, etc.  I was a little underwhelmed with the options when I went to set it up.  For a router that's well rated by CNET, I expected a lot more features.  For instance, there does not seem to be any ability to monitor traffic by devices (ie what IP addresses or DNS they are visiting).\\n\\nAfter getting everything set up, including MAC address filtering to allow only authorized devices onto the network, and scheduling parental controls with blocked hours, I thought we were good to go.  Several times during the setup process the mobile app failed to connect to the router, and at times I had to reset the router via the web interface.  The real problems became apparent when the kids' devices did not get kicked off the network during blocked times.  Then looking at the network map of connected devices, it was showing some devices with an Ethernet icon, suggesting they were on the LAN via a cable connection, when in reality they were on WiFi.  Buggy as hell.\\n\\nI called tech support to see if they had any suggestions.  One of their questions for me was. &#34;how did you set up the router?&#34;  What kind of question is that?  I logged in via the web app and went through all the settings.  Am I supposed to tell him the steps I went through verbatim?  Then the best he could do was tell me that the router should be blocking access as scheduled, and there must be something wrong inside the device.  He recommended that I return it.\\n\\nYou bet I will.  I can't get this thing back to Amazon fast enough.  What a piece of junk.  If you need to just get onto a WiFi network, it will probably do what you want, but then you can buy something cheaper that will do that.  If you want features and settings, get something else, preferably NOT from Linksys.  Good luck.","[]","B014MIBLSA","B09LYWCHJX","AGJ7JDZ77MUDTL4VIO2TKFQKZWRQ","2017-02-05 23:07:26.000","0","True","506"
"304381","2","Turn where? What?","I purchased one of these units from BestBuy while in San Diego last month, I bought for my girlfriend who had relocated there, and we used it to get around, since neither of us knew the landscape. To be fair I'll speculate that perhaps we got a faulty unit, but the experience was horrible. We referred to the unit as Tom.\\n\\nFor starters, we couldn't hear Tom speak which really got old quick. It's one thing that the GPS would show us where to turn, and what not, but an audible que is something that is more than just a luxury when navigating busy traffic. With the radio off, the windows up in the little Chevy Aveo, and the sunroof closed, with Tom's volume all the way up, we still could barely hear anything it said... Fail\\n\\nFor some reason, even though it had the traffic updates, (Which used the phone's data) Tom would still insist on taking the freeway, even if it was a parking lot. I remember we just wanted to go some place that was close, literally Down the street, and Tom still insisted on taking the freeway, when we could have taken the regular road. This behavior resulted in us getting stuck in traffic many times needlessly.... I'm not kidding, it was kind of cruel.\\n\\nThe phone paring app function was kind of cool, but since my girlfriend was the one mostly operating it, she would often get frustrated with it's lag, and sometimes you'd have to do it all over again, because Tom just simply wouldn't get the destination. This is one way you enter POIs, and destinations. I believe I remember that Tom had a hands free mode for phone calls, but we never used it, since we couldn't hear the speaker, I'm sure phone calls using this thing probably wouldn't work.\\n\\nIn the end we ended up bringing Tom back to BestBuy, and exchanging it for a Garmin, Tom got us lost one too many times in the 2 days we used it, and the fact that we couldn't hear it with any kind of noise in the car meant that we would pass turns, and exits, this caused many unnecessary re-routes, and wasted time.\\nI think that if Tom had a more audible speaker we could probably live with it, and just get used to it, even if the interface reminds me of a Fisher Price toy...","[]","B00I9UKUO4","B00I9UKUO4","AHQB72P4JV73JR77VDOKZXU2Z34Q","2017-03-25 18:58:25.000","1","False","506"
"783670","5","Solves the problem of no good smartphones being made with keyboards anymore! Adds extremely valuable accessibility to the S8.","I previously had the keyboard cover and case for my Samsung Galaxy S7, and the ability to use a physical keyboard is a major selling point to this phone for me. I was content enough with my last keyboard cover to buy one for this model!\\n\\nCompared to the S7 keyboard case, this is actually quite a bit narrower: the back cover is not nearly as wide or thick. This also has a little lip on the top sides that the S7 variant did not have that helps it cling to the phone. The keyboard cover does, in fact, hold quite snugly to the phone. Unlike on the S7 keyboard cover, where the buttons are all large and square with no gap in between, these buttons are slightly smaller and are discrete (that is to say separated slightly from one another) with rounded corners. The layout of all the keys and symbols is the same, yet somehow I find this one much easier to manipulate.\\n\\nAs with the previous model, I do very very much wish this keyboard cover had a backlight and was compatible with more cases than just the included back. However, while there are no electronic components and no visible reason why, some sort of what I presume must be magnets in the included back render the keyboard inoperable without it. You can literally hold it up just perfectly and snugly to the phone but without the back cover, it will not function. This is frustrating when trying to use cases that have magnetic phone backs included or the &#34;quick view&#34; style covers, as you would have to swap out the backs in order to use this keyboard, which is just not practical.\\n\\nHowever, I knew those limitations going into it, and am otherwise so satisfied to be able to type on a physical QWERTY keyboard! I am in my 20s and very technologically savvy, with TINY fingers, and I got the first model iPod touch when it came out, so I have literally been using touchscreen keyboards since they were widely available, but I still have never ever gotten the hang of them at all. This is a lifesaver if you're in the same boat. My typing is infinitely faster when replying to work e-mails and things like that on my phone, which makes my life a lot easier. It works well, I have not had compatibility issues with ANY apps on this phone, and it seems well made.

"677288","5","Good bang for your buck","What can I say, I’m a very picky person when it comes to headsets.  I have tried a lot of them, and a lot have been disappointing.  Either I can’t hear the caller, or the caller can’t hear me.  The sound is to loud, even on a quiet car ride, or I sound muffled.  I have tried the stereo inner ear, I have tried the one ear mono, I have tried even the round the neck hanging retractable ear piece headset.  Now there are a couple of those I tried that have been good, tolerable, even a nice sound on both ends of the call and when listening to music.  So when I went looking for a new pair, when my old one broke, I ran across these and read some of the reviews.  They sounded nice, so I decided to try it.  Got them, tested them in a few conditions, even went to the store with a call on the line, and normally it would be over powering loud on the other caller’s end that I would have to hand up and call back when I’m in more of a quiet environment.  These, they remained quiet.  Yes, they heard the background noise, but it was not over powering that they could not hear my voice clearly.  As in my end, the sound quality is really good.  The earbuds provide a nice noise canceling that I can hear the stereo quality nicely as well as any calls that I may be on.  Bottom line, these are a really good pair or headsets and I would recommend them to anyone that is like me, wary on buying headsets because of the sound quality.\\n\\nPros:\\n• Call quality is good.  Both on my end and the other caller’s end\\n• Music quality is great, stereo sound is crisp and can be adjusted well if you have an app installed.\\n• Great for exercising, the loop fits on your ears nicely to prevent any slippage when you’re working out.\\n• Charging is quick for those always on the go\\nCons:\\n• Battery life is good, but can be better.  After an all-day of listening to music and a few calls, it needs to be recharged.

"212635","1","Money Pit","Ever since I got this camera it has had issues. I wish it I didn't have a faulty model because the photos you can take with a 5D Mark III are absolutely stunning, and it is my favorite camera to work with. However, when I received my camera in the mail the internal card reader did not work. I had bought 4 different cards, none of them were working. I have worked with all kinds of Canon cameras before, including the 5D Mark iii, which is why I purchased this one. It is my absolutely favorite! So, I drove all the way down to Costa Mesa to Canon Repair to get it fixed (under warranty), but they ended up charging me $300 saying that the internal card reader was damaged and that it must have been because I had dropped it or I had damaged it somehow on my own. Basically, saying it was my fault that the internal card reader was broken... even though I hadn't even gotten a chance to use the camera yet.\\n\\nI tried to fight it, but eventually just gave up and took the loss. I went on to use the camera for a few months for my gigs, shooting around Hyatt properties. It was about the 6th time I used the camera when the Autofocus stopped working. I cleaned the electrical contacts, switched up the mode, checked out the lens. Yup, it's broken. So now I'm sending in my camera AGAIN for another repair. I don't even want to think about how much it will cost. It sucks because I was so excited to have a 5D of my own. I treat it like a baby, I bought an amazing (pricey) Canon bag to keep it in, I always clean it, keep the lens cap on, keep it out of the heat or any conditions that might hinder it. I do everything I can to ensure my cameras maintain their quality. Unfortunately the model I received has not been a quality camera, and it's costing me a lot of money.\\n\\nI would encourage you to consider buying this camera in-store and not online. I would also consider that although Canon usually creates what are considered to be some of the industry's leading cameras for photography, their customer service is extremely unpleasant and your warranty is pretty much worth nothing. I have had Nikon cameras that may not have the same quality photos, but have lasted for years, and their customer service is always a dream to deal with compared to Canon.","[]","B007FGZ1V0","B00O0ADU4O","AF3ZLSQWJHC5QLSIO3R3ZTOKJG3A","2017-06-01 20:51:26.000","2","False","506"
"633647","5","Works with Motorola and Arris cable boxes","I have these infrared extender cables on our three Charter supplied boxes and they work well. Two of our boxes are Arris DCX3220e and the other is a Motorola DCX3200. I purchased one cable and tried it with all the boxes before getting two more. Ever since consumers were forced to have a cable box we have disliked having them visible, as this often will limit placement possibilities for the TV or the box.\\n\\nOur kitchen TV is on the counter in a corner with the cable box standing upright on its side behind it. The extender eye rests on the TV stand allowing signals to be passed to the obscured cable box.\\n\\nA bedroom TV is wall mounted on an articulating arm allowing it to be seen from a bathroom as well. The cable box is actually under a table on the floor below the TV. The extension cable length of 10ft allows me to run it through the wall from the box to the TV with the other needed cables. The extension eye is stuck to the front of the TV. Just point the remote at the TV and the cable box will respond.\\n\\nOur living room TV sits on a custom made entertainment center with audio/video components below behind a glass door. The frame of the glass door partially hides the infrared eye of the cable box. The box would often not respond unless the remote was pointed just right. I now have an extender cable eye on a lower shelf than the box where it can see the remote.\\n\\nThese infrared extender cables seem to work well with no noticeable lag in response from the STB. I did unplug my cable boxes, insert the extension cable, and then power the box on again when installing. I do not know if this step was really necessary but thought it wouldn’t hurt. The extender cable does work best if it’s eye is pointed in the direction remote signals will be coming from. Do not lay it on its back facing up – use the supplied sticky “dot” to mount it sideways pointing out.\\n\\nI am pretty happy with the BATIGE IR Infrared Receiver Extension Cables. They are inexpensive and do their job. You would think cable companies would offer extender cables for their boxes as consumers are charged monthly rent for them.

"691463","5","awesome cable","iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus charging block provides a 1 amp (5 W) from the small usb block. Your phone will charge faster if you connect it to a 2.1 amp (12 W) supply block (bigger usb block), like the type that comes with iPads. You can also hook up your iPhone to a Macbook or Macbook Pro with USB 3.0 ports and your phone will charge faster because the new USB 3.0 ports now supply 2.1 amps. Google, &#34;iPhone 6 and 6 Plus support faster charging, but ship with slower power adapter.&#34;\\n\\nIn order to get faster charging times, you also need the lightning cables that can support 2.1 amps. Only OEM Apple lightning cables and MiFi certified cables (if it's rated for iPad charging) can provide the full 2.1amp charging speeds. I tested this braided 6ft Anker cable with my Macbook Pro USB 3.0 port. My iPhone charged from 15% to 80% within roughly 30-35 minutes. And don't forget, batteries charge very slowly after hitting 80%, because of trickle charging technology within the phone (to preserve life of the battery). The last 20% usually takes the same amount of time charging to the first 80%. So I can confirm the Anker Braided cable can carry the higher amps.\\n\\nThe braided part is interesting. The cord feels like a less flexible thick shoe lace. It feel very durable. Usually my cables start fraying out where the lightning connector and cord meet. The constant bending will eventually expose wires or tear it apart with other cheap lightning cords and even the Apple OEM. Anker reinforced this part with an additional gray plastic piece.\\n\\nI can see this cord being useful for people who yank their cords a lot or if the cords get bent/crinked/trapped in sharp tight corners/areas. If you have a propensity to completely destroy and mangle your usb cables... this nylon one is definitely for you. For everyone else, you can save your money and buy the regular lightning cord Anker makes.\\n\\nSee attached pictures. OEM Apple white usb cable that came with my iPad vs Gold Anker Braided cable. The higher 1.3 amp is connected to Macbook USB 3.0 and the other one is connected to the USB block that came with my iPhone 6 Plus.","[]","B071936R2S","B071936R2S","AHKNH6YIKDKPVCUXE6F72PGOSSSA","2017-08-01 00:49:17.419","1","False","505"
"974226","3","You get what you pay for","If you're anything like me, you're looking at these FreedConn units to save a few bucks.  Well....as they say... you get what you pay for.  Do they work?  Yes.  Most certainly.  But they also have issues.  I was installing these on two helmets, and in both cases the &#34;clamp style&#34; method wasn't going to work.  The velcro option seemed great -- certainly velcro can hold nearly anything in place -- but the attachment between the unit and the bracket was iffy at best.  In fact, one of the units fell off of the bracket mid-trip, in our case.  Not great.  Running the wires inside the helmets is easy enough.  Both helmets had ear cut-outs and decent places for the boom mic.  That said, the speakers could get shrill at times; decent for voice, just ok for music.  At highway speeds, both of us had difficulty understanding one another.  That seemed like more of a speaker issue than a mic issue.  And wind-noise was minimal, if at all.  The LCD screen is helpful *IF* you're looking at your helmet, but honestly....when you're riding it's absolutely useless.  You're relegated to deciphering beeps and tones.  Control was fairly easy to figure out, but the volume and track fwd/back controls need to be reversed.  More often than not, I would be trying to adjust the volume (which requires a turn + hold) and I'd change the music track instead.  Battery life is more or less as advertised, but in our case didn't really last the entire day.  What's more.... you can't charge and use the device concurrently, so you're stuck if you REALLY need to get talking again on-the-fly.  Lastly, the switching between audio and intercom is slow and cumbersome.  If you're listening to music, for instance, and hit the button for intercom, expect to hear your music cut out 6 or 7 times before the intercom connects to the other party.  In writing it's no big deal, but in the real world it gets obnoxious fast.\\n\\nIf you've read this far, my advice would be: spend a bit more and get a higher-end unit.  Sena SMH5 (or better) is simply a better product.","[]","B013JVIVFC","B08C779PWT","AGL6P4KWKHIXI3EH7NAUN52IYYPQ","2017-09-05 05:02:04.639","3","True","505"

However, the system doesn't actually record the audio, it is only active while viewing in one camera mode and that's it. So it's really quite pointless since you don't have 2 way remote communication capabilities either so what's the point? Most stuff will have already happened and you will only be able to review the video footage.\\n--no ability to add a separate mic to the system so effectively no audio capability\\n--4 camera maximum\\n--video quality is very low resolution - not even 720HD\\n--final deal breaker is system shuts down after a few minutes all the time - battery charge is good so it's not a dead battery issue.\\nAlso, it freezes up half the time on reboot. After further review of previous days recordings, 3rd and 4th day when it did record, upon review, each 2 minute clip would freeze up after 10 -15 seconds and then sometimes jump a minute or two to another still frame and that's it.\\n\\nSo in summary, yeah, great concept but poorly thought out and apparently QC is total $*it too. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.\\nI will probably sell off the cameras as they are in working condition, but the base unit - the brains of the whole thing- is crap.","[]","B0091DR2NK","B0091DR2NK","AHZX6X7M63MKIK4RXC7GGRI5BUTQ","2017-06-25 01:51:33.000","0","False","505"

Sometimes placing an order for 2  (yet receiving 4 with the 2 for 1 in the promotion offer)!  In all, I ended up with 10 fans thus far.  I have had one motor failure.  And in fairness, I probably could have contacted Benks to ask them replace it - but I never got around to it.\\nI don't think Benks lists the mah consumption - but other vendors list theirs as 80 mah.  When this fan is plugged into an Anker Astro E1 Candy-Bar Sized Ultra Compact Portable Charger, 6700 mah - it will run days without battery needing a charge!\\nNow, let me tell you something important about the fans Benks sells  - in contrast to other similar fan vendors here on Amazon.  At the time I wrote this Fall review, Benks is very low in stock.  Now,  getting near Christmas  - I need some for in-expensive gifts for those outside of family. So I placed and received a order from a look-a- like vendor.  After receiving them,  WITHIN ONE MINUTE OF OPERATION, THE FAN BLADES SPUN OFF THE SHAFT.  I tried both fans and motors that came in the package - they both did the same thing!  If you will note, Benk's fans (Android version) are YELLOW-GREEN in color.  STAY AWAY FROM THE MORE LIME-GREEN COLORED FANS OFFERED BY OTHERS.  Again, of the 10 fans I have acquired from Benks- only 1 motor failure - and in truth - I don't know what caused it to fail.\\n\\nLastly, from my technical background & experience working & using small electronic devices - I have advised those I have given these fans to to only use the fan with the Anker battery I gave them or another full size USB port on a PC, different battery etc.  But,  NOT to power the fan from the fragile micro-USB on an Android phone.  The fan will get eventually get bumped, dropped at a ball game, event, etc.  Why ruin a nice phone that will not charge, after you have damaged the micro-USB port when you can pick up a nice battery for under $20 that will power the fan for much longer.","[]","B01HIB1N2M","B01HIB1N2M","AFPHPLBWRLQNLHBI25X4GGIHMVSQ","2017-11-19 21:25:23.852","2","False","505"

"394305","3","Good, but not good enough for my standards","Let's start with the good:\\n\\nThe design is great. Very minimal bezels, mostly metal body, and good looking (and sturdy) legs. The top 2/3 of the screen is very thin. Bottom 1/3 is thicker, but houses all the internals.\\n\\nThe panel is great for a TV of this price. Not the brightest, but will do for most environments. Displays a wide color gamut and has low input lag in game mode\\n\\nThe UI is good, not great. Android TV feels familiar if you use an Android phone and actually allows the TV to be setup using an Android device. Still some bugs with certain apps force closing.\\n\\nThe sound is about as good as you can get in a TV. Due to the form factor you're obviously not going to be getting deep bass. Rather shallow sound. But that's TV speakers for you.\\n\\nNow the not so good:\\n\\nFrame bent: This isn't necessarily LeEco's fault, but about halfway across the top the frame was bent. Imagine the iphone bend problem...it looked like that. Luckily, it didn't seem to affect the panel itself. It was there from box opening. I 2 person lifted the TV properly, so it wasn't my handling that caused the damage.\\n\\nLight bleed: For some reason LeEco decided to light the entire screen from the bottom. On dark content you can definitely see a small strip of light bleed on the bottom edge.\\n\\nClouding: Again, on dark scenes you can see some clouding of the blacks. It's hard not to notice once you spot it. Bright and/or colorful scenes don't suffer.\\n\\nSo in summary, this TV is good, but not without flaws. I got it for under $700, which is a good price for what you're getting here. Panel differences could eliminate the clouding or light bleed issue, along with the bent frame. I definitely wanted to like this TV, it looks excellent in my living room. Right now, I've purchased a refurb Samsung KS8000 to test this one against. If the Sammy ends up being better, the LeEco is going back. If not, Amazon is willing to provide a replacement for this TV free of charge due to the issues.","[]","B01N64EGNK","B01N64EGNK","AEASZCBPZTPKF5LZM5AGAXAQJQLQ","2017-05-07 17:38:39.000","21","True","505"

The base unit has several optional components, so check for exactly what you are getting.  Mine has the optional Intel based wireless NIC which is getting me 50Mbs using my home WiFi,  the 14' 1920x1080 screen which is very very good, and a small 128GB SSD, which in my unit is a Samsung, and very fast.  I am using the SD card slot with a 256GB SDXC drive and am getting  very high read / write speeds compared to other SDXC card slots, and well above any rotating media drive.  I will shortly replace the 128GB internal with a much larger drive, and from the Lenovo documentation and forums, it seems the laptop accomodates both an M.2 and standard 7mm SATA drives. With the standard and the large integrated battery (great feature)  i get about 6 to 7 hours with default Win10 balanced power settigs and screen brightness of 70%.  My unit is the i5 with 8GB of ram, and very capable for any typical office automation task.  Lenovo has excellent support utilities,  much superior when compared to my past experience with Dell, HP and especially Toshiba.  Very good automated updates for BIOS, and system drivers, without any spyware being  pushed down that I can  detect.  The only additional option I would have wanted  was the integrated fingerprint scanner.\\n\\nTwo small gripes.\\n1) The Touchpad does not have separate buttons. I found the integrated mouse click feature, and touch response control pretty spotty till a driver update I found (not automatically suggested by Lenovo), and now it is adaquate.  I still prefer using a Logitech trackball with the unit.\\n\\n2) The keyboard layout is odd, with a function lock key where the Control key is on standard US desktop keyboards, which screws up ctrl key based shortcuts for copy, paste, cursor movement, selection, etc.  Can be solved with a keyboard remapping, or just reprogramming 25 years of keyboard shortcut experience.\\n\\nOverall the T440s is an excellent laptop, and even three years old is better than anything at a compareable price.\\n\\nSeller was very good in answering questions responsively and helping during an initial setup issue.","[]","B06XS75MLJ","B06XS75MLJ","AH67DQINHTPPHQ6OKU534B4LUHSA","2017-12-02 21:16:30.982","0","True","505"

They are way too small for any/all applications. If you do not have a completely flat surface -the screws are unacceptable (like replacing an existing wired doorbell to vinyl siding like I did). This is because the screws have to be fullly seated into the plastic mounting bracket in order for the doorbell to slide in / lock and fully seat into the mounting bracket hooks (and the bracket being much larger than a standard doorbell or mounting bracket). Also, I was unable to use any of my longer screws to install the bracket in order to make it more secure without bending the bracket or folding / buckling in the siding (which I tried), this is due to the screw holes being beveled out.\\n\\nI ended up doing the best I could with what came with the product. The problem is, this leaves me feeling like my device is not fully secured to my house in the fashion that Ring designed or I would prefer.\\n\\nThat said, I'd recommend the manufacturer include a short, medium, and long screw for any type of mounting application -or- make the slide hooks on the mounting bracket longer so that any universal screw may be used to install the bracket.\\n\\nMy installation took at least 5 times longer than it should've due to this issue while trying many different screws/methods, and I still feel that my mounting bracket is not as secured to my home as it should be...but it's up, level, working, and looks great, I just hope that I do not not have future issues- like if it gets bumped into by one of my children!\\n\\nThat said- I would, and already have recommended this product to all of my friends and family...I love it!\\nI'm even considering getting some of the Ring security cameras for my home.\\n\\nLastly, just putting this out there- I am not a person who ever does any reviews, so I hope this helps at least one person, and saves you time with your install.\\n\\nSemper Fi,\\nKeith","[]","B00N2ZDXW2","B00N2ZDXW2","AF4FF2IAOUIBGXNEF3JRWMLHGRIQ","2017-03-25 06:51:56.000","0","False","505"
"892131","4","Appropriate for most point-and-shoots with Li-ion batteries","The product listing gives almost no useful information, so I'll include a bit here.\\n\\nThe charger is perfect for almost all of the infinite variations on little flat Li-ion batteries found in point-and-shoot cameras. It will physically accommodate widths up to about 52mm. The width adjusts in 1mm steps, is lightly spring-loaded with a give of about 2mm, and the edges have a rubbery material with enough friction to hold small batteries securely in place... but perhaps not large, heavy batteries from video cameras, DSLR's, etc.\\n\\nThe charging terminals adjust for separations of 2-48mm. They're spring-loaded in height (3-5mm over the charging bed) and length (about 2mm of give). Polarity is not marked on the terminals, since that is detected automatically. (Would that work with a completely discharged battery? Not sure.)\\n\\nThe device markings show the output for charging Li batteries as 600mA at either 4.2V or 8.4V -- it automatically detects batteries as being either 3.6V or 7.2V.  A 600mA max. charging current is well matched to the small (750-1200mAh) batteries usually found in compact point-and-shoot cameras, and the automatic charging worked fine for the few types that I had at hand.\\n\\nHowever, the max. charging current would be on the low side for the higher capacity batteries used in DSLR's; an OEM charger would almost certainly charge more quickly for those.\\n\\nThe output for charging two NiMH batteries is shown as 600mA at 1.4V; if so, the max. voltage is on the low side for efficient charging. One would be happier with a good smart charger, especially one that evaluates batteries individually. This one didn't seem to be handling a couple of mostly charged NiMH Eneloop AAA's in an intelligent fashion, so I stopped testing.\\n\\nThe USB output cannot be used with batteries in the charging tray and is rated at only 1000mAh -- less than half of what modern smartphone chargers can usually deliver -- so this is of limited use.\\n\\nSo, I would give it 5 *'s for my use (dealing with small Li-ion batteries from point-and-shoots), but those planning other uses may be disappointed.","[]","B009JXZS8S","B009JXZS8S","AFPMGKHRSGL4VSKRPSCWGEHWD4FQ","2017-02-24 19:36:04.000","2","False","505"

I don't own a TV of my own. Roommate I had, had one that I used with a Roku. Now I've moved, and the larger screen is a good size for my living room.\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is for the 27"" IPS\\n\\nSo far no issues. Moderate overall use for 1 month now. Heavy on some days off. Arrived on time. No dead pixels. Yes there is IPS glow. They all have some. It is minimal, and the only time I notice is on start up when the whole screen is totally black for a few seconds. Haven't noticed in games or video.\\n\\nUsing on PC with DisplayPort and Xbox One with HDMI. No issues on either.\\n\\nThe only things I've noticed is watching Netflix specifically, sometimes it looks like it's not streaming in FHD. I've never used 2k before though, so it might be something between that and Netflix. Switching to other inputs would be much better with just one button, but it's not difficult as it is.\\n\\nRaises up and lowers on the stand very easily. Tilts up and down easily. Moving sideways is stiff but not a problem really. Rotation of portrait to landscape is also easy.\\n\\nBlue light filter is there, seems to work, but even with it off, after hours of use I didn't feel any eye strain or headaches.\\n\\nIf you're having it delivered to your home, they may take it to a UPS/USPS/FEDEX office. The package is huge. The retail box for a 27&#34; monitor is large. They put THAT box in another box that's even bigger. That's OK though because the exterior box is plain and they put extra packing material inside. If you can't be aware of when your delivery comes (like you live in a house and see them stop for your mail) I would try to divert the package to an office you can pick up at.

"744449","5","Worth the money","So far, so good. Did some testing with mine today using Audacity to see what could be picked up by the mic and to make sure everything is functioning. The program btw, shows me sound waves during recording and playback, so even if I can't hear it, I could see if something was picked up. It's free and works well if anyone is looking for recording software. I've used it on and off for years.\\n\\nWhat I found: it will still pick up noises in the room, like my birds calling, but not quieter, scuffling sounds. A plane and car passed by outside my window and while I heard both clearly, the mic didn't pick them up. If the window was open, it might've though. Where it will help is to cut out ambient room noise so you don't have the speaker phone effect.\\n\\nOn the earbud end, sound came through clearly. No crackling or buzzing that I could discern. There was a slight buzzing or seashell effect from some programs between recordings, but the volume was comparable to audio only earbuds I have for music players. When I first plugged it in with no programs open, it was quiet. It was a little bizarre hearing my own voice come back at me having not used a headset before, but it's not distracting, and it's understandable given that the headset takes over the speaker system.\\n\\nComfort: pleasantly surprised these worked well! I had to switch to the smallest earphone covers though. They're soft rubber and easy to replace. The ones they came pre-assembled with were too wide and left the earphones sitting on my tragus instead of inside my ear like earbuds should. After the switch, the whole piece sat properly and didn't flop around. There's a tiiiny diagram in the booklet that shows how it should sit and that was my only clue that the original placement without switching the earphone covers, was wrong. All the parts rotate, so adjust accordingly for a good fit.\\n\\nWeight: unless you have sensitive ears, these are of fairly negligible weight. The larger ear loops are hard plastic and I was originally concerned they would either be delicate or uncomfortable. But they felt ok (comparable to glasses) and do have a little give. Just don't be too rough and throw them in your bag without its case, and they'll be fine.","[]","B00427Q84O","B00427Q84O","AE5MRR7YSD5GFN6OISUBS5BPWPGA","2017-01-14 22:00:23.000","2","True","505"

The headphones worked well enough at first but I’ve been having a few problems. Fairly early on I had quite a few complaints from people I talked to over the phone; they would often say they couldn’t understand or hear me when I tried using the microphone on the headphones. It would sometimes help to hold the microphone right up to my mouth but that kind of defeats the purpose. I eventually gave up and stopped trying to use that feature. The biggest problem is just starting to occur. Occasionally while I’m watching a movie on my laptop or listening to music on my phone the sound will get very quiet or even go completely silent for short periods of time. All in all I’m very disappointed in them; I decided to pay the high price of $84.99 because I wanted quality headphones for once but it seems like these have the same kind of issues you’d expect from $10-$20 headphones.

The 4 cameras included (only supports 4 cameras and cannot be increased) provide good clear view in day and night. The DVR receiver is located in my aluminum can of an RV in which we are living while renovating out house.  Even inside this aluminum shell, the cameras set up around the property from about 50' away to about 120' are received adequately to provide fairly consistent recordings.  The farthest one will occasionally cut out a couple times per day but normally gets reconnected in a few seconds or so.  The motion detection events will send emails with a snapshot, but they are fairly worthless since they are either pictures of bugs flying near the camera at night which appear to be attracted to the IR illumination lights or are just images of the background after whatever triggered the motion sensor has moved out of view.  The recorded videos both day and night are pretty clear and good quality.  Rain storms at night provide lots (100's) of email snapshots of the rain drops falling in front of the camera.\\n\\nSince I am in temporary renovation mode with my house, I have these cameras running on long extension cords.  These cords get unplugged and moved around a bit while doing construction and the system handles that very smoothly.  The cameras disconnect and then reconnect when they get power again seamlessly and reliably.  And the recordings of the disconnected cameras clearly display their video availability on the search screen to show when they were running and when they were off.\\n\\nThe remote access via PC, iPhone, or iPad works very well and is easier to manage and use than my other Foscam R2 IP camera.  Also, Reolink does not continually bug you to get you to buy their Cloud recording service like Foscam does.\\n\\nUPDATE 7/25/2018: Took away 2 stars. I have had this system for 9 months and so far 3 of the 4 camera power supplies (wall warts) have failed. I happen to have compatible transformers in my big tub from previous gadgets, so I was able to get them going again. But 3 out of 4 failing in the last two months makes me believe there is a quality problem. I haven’t tried to get them replaced yet, but I may need to since I assume the warranty is only good for a couple more months and I may run out of replacements at this rate.","[]","B01C8BZGKW","B01C8BZGKW","AFIJCQPYZDUYJKUPC2VINYRALQFA","2017-11-06 14:48:24.196","3","True","505"
"755251","4","Good for workouts, great for sleeping","This is not a review of sound quality -- for my purposes, it just doesn't matter all that much. The four-star rating is for wearability and battery life.\\n\\nI wear these occasionally for running/working out. They're great for that -- they stay put, they don't annoy me in any way, and they don't make my ears hurt. I have very small ears, and most earbuds hurt a lot after brief periods, even with their smallest covers. These aren't the slightest bit uncomfortable for the first hour, and only slightly uncomfortable in my ears after three or four hours. And they stay put. Did I mention that?\\n\\nI also wear them every single night as I fall asleep. They're great for that, too -- while I have to adjust a little bit to make sure they don't feel like they're digging into the back of my head/top of my neck, it's easy to find a position that's comfortable. They mean I don't wake up tangled in cord, but they stay on until some time in the middle of the night when I remove them (often while mostly asleep) and toss them on the floor next to my bed. They turn themselves off automatically after a few minutes of not being connected to anything, but since I'm not turning them off when I take them off, they're basically on all night (though only usually playing continuous sound for the first half hour or so). I have to charge them once a week or less. They've changed my falling asleep routine, and I credit them with giving me an extra 20 minutes of sleep every night.\\n\\nCons, which don't matter to me much in my use:\\n\\n-Microphone is obviously not anywhere near your mouth, so while they can be used for phone calls, etc, you don't sound great to the person on the other end\\n-No volume control on the headset, so you still need to access your phone to adjust volume\\n-LED indicator light flashes so slowly to indicate headset status that I can't always tell at a glance whether they're on or off.\\n-Sound occasionally cuts in and out, though I suspect this is due to bluetooth/my phone, not the headset.\\n\\nOverall, I really like this headset and have recommended to my husband that he consider one for himself for workouts and sleeping.","[]","B06XWJHSGH","B06XX7QKL2","AGQ5NMWWCXEZK7C4JYJ6M25T4HSA","2017-07-24 14:50:07.222","4","False","505"
"415150","5","Well worth the money.","The computer arrived promptly and was well-packaged. It was EXTREMELY clean. While it is a refurbished machine, I had to look hard at it to see signs of previous use. All I found was a single little scuff mark on the corner. Other than that the system was immaculate. However, several buttons off of the number pad of the keyboard popped off during transit. While I was able to safely reattach most of them the &#34;delete&#34; key suffered some damage. It works but doesn't rise up as much as it should. The mouse was in perfect condition. Both the keyboard and mouse were brand-new in the box.\\n\\nI didn't buy this system for either the keyboard or the mouse, however, so I'm not taking points off for the keyboard being damaged during shipping. Even if I had, these things happen on occasion when you purchase a computer. For the price I am not going to complain about the keyboard. I had a better quality one that I prefer anyway so both the keyboard and mouse that came with the system were going to be kept as spares.\\n\\nNote that the computer does NOT come with a monitor. For this price, you receive the computer, a mouse and a keyboard--that is all.\\n\\nThis system came with a clean &#34;refurbished&#34; install of Windows 10. The Product Key sticker specifies that it is for refurbished PCs. It takes a while to boot up so plan to wait a bit when you turn it on. After it boots, however, the system runs like a dream! I do a lot of multitasking so I purchased this system in hopes that it could handle the load better than my previous computer. I have not been disappointed. It has taken everything I have thrown at it so far and kept going--and I have deliberately used it hard to test the machine.\\n\\nThis is a wonderful computer for the price. While it might be an older, refurbished system, it has much better specs than you can find in new systems at a similar price point. In fact, I paid several hundred dollars more not too long ago for a system that wasn't half as powerful as this one.\\n\\nIf you want to purchase a quality desktop computer on a budget, you cannot go wrong with this system. It is well worth the money.","[]","B01KWP82CK","B01KWP82CK","AG55YHZ44ULCX2D7XAIOSUB4PBJQ","2017-10-12 18:35:46.742","7","True","505"
"759885","4","Could they be better? Yes","I'm going with 4 stars. Could they be better? Yes. Did I return them? No. Am I super happy to not have headphone wires? ABSOFERKINLUTELY!\\n\\nNow for the rest:\\n\\nIf you're thinking these are going to be some magical sounding headphones that will beat your wired headphones, don't buy wireless. Taking into consideration you are literally streaming digital-to-analog data over bluetooth (NOT WiFi people!), if you keep your expectations realistic then you'll be stoked with the sound and quality of these.\\n\\nComparing to HD 380 Pro Headphones:\\nThe ear cups are much smaller than that of other Sennheiser 380s so keep this in mind. It doesn't bother me because I like the smaller footprint for when I need to hit up Costco. The 380s are much bulkier which is good for studio, bad for mobility on the road. The sound quality of the 380s is better (richer bass for sure) - there's no argument there - however the HD 4.50 headphones are very comparable and if you attach the cable. The 380s have better mid to lows, but it's only slightly when comparing both as wired headphones.\\n\\nI've never owned a pair of noise cancelling headphones so I can't compare BUT this is definitely one reason I kept these. Usually I'm tuning to EDM music at work, but when I changed to classical, WHOAH, what a difference in ambient noise! The lows are almost completely removed from the environment around me. If you have &#34;white noise&#34; at work, this is a Godsend because it will almost eliminate that humming noise of a/c and fans etc. People talking is much quieter too so I'm going with the other professional reviews in that the noise cancellation is stellar. One thing to note after using them in loud environments like driving in a car, the cancellation might give you a headache; the extra noise cancellation messes with your hearing, but this is the same with all headphones and you can turn it off easily.\\n\\nOverall I'm happy with the purchase. Just don't be thinking these are going to give you studio quality sound like I did originally. They're still only $200 and I think they're great at that price point. Even if they are made in ch*na.","[]","B01MSZSL4I","B01MSZSL4I","AE3PPUGNM6Y57U5N63F4SOFJGPGA","2017-05-19 23:28:20.000","5","False","505"
"826995","5","Insane Speeds!!!","INSANE SPEEDS!!! No, I didn't purchase my Orbi from Amazon. But this router is so freaking awesome, that I had to write a review...I live in a small town in Texas. I have Fidelity high-speed internet. I pay for 250 Mbps download and 10 Mbps upload speeds. With my regular Arris Surfboard Router/Modem. I was getting 273-276 Mbps on my hardwired desktop (Back of my house), 273 Mbps on my mobile phone, 25-40 Mbps on my laptop (front of my house), and 15-24 Mbps on my XBox One.\\n\\nMy first attempt at an upgrade was the Netgear Nighthawk X10. I assumed that since it was the most expensive router on the market, that it would solve all of my Wifi problems. While my hardwired desktop speeds were strong and consistent. My Wifi speeds were all over the place. My laptop speeds were 40-75 Mbps But my XBox One speeds started out at 100 Mbps, then they would fluctuate between 30-80 Mbps. So I returned it and bought the Orbi RBR50 AC3000.\\n\\nFirst of all, the Orbi was a breeze to install. It was pretty much, plug-n-play. My hardwired speeds dipped a little to 260-264 Mbps. My laptop gets a consistent 40-51 Mbps. But what blew my mind were the Speeds I received on my XBox One. When I ran it off just the Wifi, my speeds were slow at 24-28 Mbps. But man oh man. Once I ran an ethernet cable from my Orbi satellite to my XBox One, my speeds were insane. My first speed test was 295 Mbps. I figured that had to be a fluke, so I ran another one. This time my speeds were 331 Mbps. And that's when I started doing the cabbage patch. lol I've run a few more test, while they didn't hit the 331 mark again. I'm getting a consistent 296-299 Mbps. Next, I'll be hardwiring my laptop to my satellite as well.\\n\\nSo, if you're a gamer. I highly recommend you invest in an Orbi router. Just remember to run an ethernet cable directly from your Orbi satellite into your gaming console.\\n\\nPS All of my upload speeds were consistent 10-12 Mbps","[]","B01K4CZOBS","B0BT1BTW94","AG6FJVGU63MQ4YK6FY62JRLJ7OPQ","2017-11-29 02:48:50.462","1","False","505"
"870499","1","I wish I had known about the problems with Netflix before I purchased this product.","With the exception of issues when trying to watch anything from Netflix, this is a good product. If you are a Netflix user, this is a nightmare. First of all let me state that the problems trying to view anything on Netflix are not with my network or ISP. I can stream Netflix over other streaming devices without any problems at all. When trying to stream anything from Netflix with the Fire TV Stick, it will buffer somewhere around 20% to 25% and will just hang at that point. I can back out by using the back button on the remote and try to load the video again but it will once again freeze when buffering at either the same percentage or around 15%. The only way I can watch something on Netflix is to go into the settings of the Fire TV Stick and then into the installed applications part of the settings and clear both the cache and data for the Amazon (yes, I said Amazon) streaming Video app. I then have to clear just the cache (not the data though) for the Netflix app. I then have to go into the device part of the settings and chose to restart the device. Once the device has restarted I need to immediately go into the Netflix app, chose what I want to watch and it will immediately start and play without any buffering issues or problems. If I want to watch something else through Netflix I need to go through that whole routine again. I have found threads on various forums on the Internet about this problem that go back to 2015. People have been communicating this issue back to Amazon since 2015 and they have been aware of it since at least 2015. The steps I outlined to solve this issue (for one viewing) came from an Amazon customer support agent. The fact that they have not been able to solve this issue in 2+ years and that part of the solution lies with clearing the cache and data from their own video app points to suspicious behavior on Amazon's part. Could this be that Amazon would rather have Fire TV Stick viewers view movies through Amazon Prime rather than Netflix? I do not know if that is the case but it sure looks like Amazon is trying to make it painful to view movies via Netflix with their device in hopes that the customer will dump Netflix and subscribe to Amazon Prime instead. If that is what is happening, Amazon should hang their head in shame. If that is not what is happening, Amazon should fix the issues with the Netflix streaming app. Why has it been this way for 2+ years? Your customers deserve an answer.","[]","B00ZV9RDKK","B075X8471B","AHCUV5DU6GNOCJ3HV2Z24JHCRQWA","2017-08-20 18:35:08.741","0","True","505"
"829606","5","An excellent product despite its annoying ""eye""","Echo Dot 2:\\n\\nI must begin by stating that I did not buy the Echo for its voice recognition/response features, nor have I used them in the month that I've had the device (other than to query the weather when first connected, which worked well).  Instead, I was/am attracted by its audio streaming features and the ability to control them remotely via apps on various other devices, i.e. phones, tablets and computers.  I have my Echo connected to an auxiliary input to my receiver in the living room.  This may seem a limited use of a device that perhaps can do much more, but for $40, I couldn't resist the ability to free my cell phone from service as a wired streaming device in my home, and privacy concerns prevent me from leaving the Echo's microphones turned on.  That said, and for the purpose stated, it performs wonderfully and my quibbles are minor.  It is small and relatively innocuous, setup is a breeze, the remote control apps for various platforms work as expected and overall I am quite pleased.  Re quibbles: with the mics turned off (my normal condition), the ring of leds in the rim glows bright red as well as the icon on the mic-off button, which my wife finds particularly annoying (she calls it a big red eye and hides it behind other items on the shelf); Although the apps for Windows 10 and Android have behaved flawlessly, the iPhone app often disconnects from the Echo, requiring that the app be shut down and restarted - not a showstopper, but annoying.  The Android app automatically restarts whenever it is given focus.\\n\\nNote that streaming content is not dependent on an external app, the app is merely a control medium as an alternative to voice control directly to Echo.  Once streaming is started, it continues regardless whether an app is running on any external device until another command is received.  If apps are running on multiple external devices, all of them will indicate the status of Echo and any of them can issue commands (adjust volume, select source stream, etc.)\\n\\nI am well pleased with the Echo.  It has become our primary source for music in our home and we no longer must incapacitate a cell phone to access streaming services.  The current price is a bargain as well.  If only I could turn off that bright red ring.","[]","B01DFKC2SO","B01K8B8YA8","AFMPT6SWVMZDZANYRJT7XNOGSMRQ","2017-01-28 15:48:55.000","2","True","505"
"95828","5","Great!","[[VIDEOID:73872ded68f355615a096d6a8e47b23f]] I have been looking for a decent Android tv box for weeks now and almost every single one seems to have a major issue where they either lag/freeze, slow down and occasionally crash. It just seems that none of the companies were getting it right. Well I have to say this one def stands out. With a boost in RAM and memory, it seems that all the issues have been resolved. Good box if you're willing to put the work into it. My suggestion is to format the entire box and start from scratch. If you don't mind doing that great purchase. You will have to know how to reset up things like Kodi though and any sources. The reason I'm saying to format it is that it comes with a lot of Chinese bloatware both involving sources as well as apps on the actual box (which you will have to uninstall and disable manually even after formatting.) I'm only suggesting to remove these sources and apps for the sheer fact that they are not exactly on the legit side if you know what I mean. Anyway, if you're willing to put a little time into it, know how to set things back up and can deal with a little initial frustration this box is a surprisingly decent piece of hardware especially for the price, but like I said your kind of sacrificing time instead of money on this box when compared to something that comes perfect out of the box like some of the T95Z plus's competition, but these other boxes often cost around 100+ more dollars depending on the brand.\\n\\nSide note: 1.) The mouse feature takes some getting used to 2.) If you drop the task bar at the bottom of the screen you will either need a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard to pull it back up or turn the box on and off to bring it back up although it really shouldn't be visible when streaming videos through different apps like Netflix or Hulu. 3.) If you want to play games on it you can but the USB 2.0 ports do not support wired controllers so you'll have to use wireless ones. 4.) Check games for controller compatibility before you buy them to save any frustration it may cause you. 5.) Finally this one is an obvious one but make sure to sign in to your Google play account or create one so you can access the app store on your box.\\n\\nOverall I love it!","[]","B071HG3GS2","B071HG3GS2","AGOX37HDMEPMU4Q62QTGS6VLAN2Q","2017-05-23 14:29:15.000","60","True","505"
"734957","2","Not ready for prime time.  I dissapointment, slow with online content.  Online content is not very well integrated.","I had one of the original Tivo's, a DirecTivo that I loved, and hacked and used for many years.  I was excited to get back into the Tivo family.  I ditched DirecTV after being a customer for nearly 20 years.  I grew to miss watching sports, and after about 6 months of nothing but Roku, I gave the Tivo Roamio a try.  I'm using this with an antenna, and I've had this unit for a couple months, so here are my thoughts.  The remote is a tad too complicated.  Some of the buttons are too easy to press, and others are tiny and you have to look to see which one you're pressing.  If you're watching online content, a few of the buttons will cancel a search and take you out of the online portal immediately.  This is very frustrating because this unit does not integrate very well, or at least as well as I was expecting, given the cost, and the high performance of other devices that cost literally 1/10 the cost.  This unit takes quite a while to load Netflix or Amazon.  The fast forward, rewind, slow motion and 8 second back buttons do not work like you would expect them too.  There is no preview when using fast forward or rewind.  If you accidentally hit the large Tivo button, you're kicked out of the online portal and have to go thru the loading process all over.  I've been searching for content and hit the wrong button on the remote, more than one time, and been kicked out of the menu and back to &#34;Live Tv&#34;, or the Tivo menu.  The Tivo button is way, way too sensitive and i&#34;m not kidding when I write that on multiple occasions I've been trying to search for content or navigate the online menus and have been kicked out of the online portion and had to reload.  It's very frustrating.  The bottom line is this, if you're thinking of using this for both online and broadcast content, save your money and purchase a broadcast only device along with your favorite streaming device.  I enjoyed my $35 dollar Roku, and my first gen Apple TV far more than I do this Tivo.  For recording broadcasts, it's fine.  It just doesn't integrate as seamlessly as I was expecting, and the online performance and user interface are severely lacking.","[]","B01DR4T73Q","B01DR4T73Q","AFKNFRA35L47TJLB5GGC34KD23XQ","2017-05-30 00:43:26.000","1","True","505"

So far, it's working great.\\n\\nMy ATT DSL Pace modem had that problem of having to be power cycled every time the internet connect was lost (which was nearly every morning). My neighbor had the same problem with her Pace modem, and from looking online there are numerous ATT customers with the same problem.  The other modem that ATT sells is notorious for you having to routinely click refresh on your web browser in order to get the webpage to display.  So, what to do?  I looked on Amazon and found this Actiontec modem with good reviews and rolled the dice.  Not only is it cheaper, but so far it's working better than the ATT provided ones.\\n\\nWhat you'll need if you're an ATT DSL customer - you will first need to obtain your DSL (PPPoE) login and password.  Your login is going to be (username)@att.net.  If you do not know your username and/or password, you will need to phone ATT customer service at 800-288-2020 then you'll press 2, then 3.  The customer service rep will ask for various bits of info including answers to you secret questions. If you're like me, you won't know the secret answers to the questions.  No problem. They will ring you on the line (if you're phoning from your home phone, you will need to have call waiting to click over to the verification call) to verify your identity.\\n\\nWith your username/pw, go to the wizard at 192.168.0.1, select for it to automatically configure the modem, type in your login/pw when requested, and after a bit of song and dance, you'll be up and running.  If prompted to select PPPoE or PPPoA, you want to select PPPoE for AT&T DSL.\\n\\nAfter you do all that, I recommend setting your modem's admin pw. On your admin page, click the Advanced Setup button on far right, then on the left hand column scroll down to Security and click Admin Password.  When putting in a password, do NOT use a % as one of the characters in your password. It will confuse the heck out of the modem, requiring you to reset the thing and start all over.","[]","B004NBZ98K","B004NBZ98K","AERIBAWFG2JC7Z67OSJRES3PJSGQ","2017-05-22 20:19:58.000","5","True","505"

They are junky in that there is no cabinet side bracing or cross bracing, the thinnest of polyester batting tacked to the inside cabinet walls, and the drivers are not flush-mounted. 5/8ths inch cabinet as well.  I adressed the first two issues,  I did the natural felt trick around the tweeter to minimize edge diffraction, and I run them with the grills off.\\nThe BICs are more efficient, and have higher Max SPL than the KEFs. I knew that going in. They also image well. What they don't do well is run well on bass heavy music, because it muddies up the mid-range, and the lower reaches of it's range get loose. With a sub, and crossed over surprisingly high for a 6.5 inch woofer, they are REALLY nice. The KEF needs a sub, too, but not because it misbehaves, just because it doesn't go deep enough for me.\\nThe KEF imagining is astounding. It is not about pin-point locationing. It is about HUGE. When I am behind my couch in the large room, with the BICs, you can tell that the show is happening up there, in front of the couch.  The Q100? Its just the same everywhere. Off axis sounds the same as in front of it. Move side to side, no collapse of image.  Remarkable. And that is with some pretty large toe-in.\\nThe KEFs are going back.

"647034","2","Mishandles Daylight Saving Time","The daylight saving time controls on this device do not work correctly. As background, when US daylight savings time (DST) is in effect, NIST's WWVB atomic time standard radio transmission reports that fact, every hour on the hour, in its rather complex time code.\\n\\nWhat's supposed to happen next: If the clock's DST control is turned on, then when WWVB says DST is in effect, the clock sets the time forward one hour. If the user has turned DST off, the clock ignores WWVB's DST code.\\n\\nWhat actually happens: Even if the DST control is turned off, the next time a DST-is-now-in-effect code is received, the clock turns DST on. If the user turns it off again, at the next round hour the clock overrides the user setting and turns DST back on again.\\n\\nWe live in Arizona, which uses Mountain Standard Time (MST) but does not use DST. Because of this DST-handling flaw, our RCR-22 is wrong by one hour for about half the year. We have spent a lot of time adjusting the clock settings, resetting it to factory defaults, cold-rebooting the processor with the little paperclip switch on the underside, moving the time signal antenna around to find the best WWVB reception, etc. But nothing solves the problem. The only solution we have found is to manually change the clock's time zone to Pacific Standard Time (PST) + DST, which gives the correct Arizona time during the months of the year when DST is in effect, then manually change back to Mountain Time during the non-DST months.\\n\\nWe need to emphasize that this is NOT normal atomic clock behavior.

"365626","3","Nice headphones, but had difficulty hearing on the (loudest) airplane setting","We purchased these headphones for the sole purpose of entertaining our 2 year old on an airplane - so he didn't turn into THAT KID - the one who screams and kicks your seat the entire flight.  You're welcome. :-)\\n\\nPROS:\\n\\n1. The headphones have a quality feel and they're very cute.\\n2. The completely disconnecting stereo mini cable is a fantastic idea for kids although the cable provided is very nice.\\n3. My son's head circumference is 20&#34; and the headphones fit OK on the smallest setting. The headphones fit me too and I thought they were comfortable.\\n4. The reproduced audio was acceptable.\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\n1. The SPL level on the airplane was roughly 90dB (typical for a plane).  On the airplane setting the headphone audio was low despite turning up the volume to max on our devices.  My toddler kept complaining he couldn't hear.  I thought the audio level was acceptable if I pressed the headphones against my ears.  An over hear version might be more effective or a more flexible limiter.\\n\\n2.  The audio out jack for daisy chaining is not limited so if you connect your standard headphones the audio will be obnoxiously loud.  I had to turn the audio down to 50% so my audio was comfortable but at that setting there was no discernible audio from the BuddyPhones.  I'm probably supposed to buy another set, but I don't really want pink kid headphones.\\n\\n3.  Be wary of the type of case you have on your device.  We have one of those foam shockproof kid safe covers on our iPad, there's plenty of room for a standard stereo mini but the daisy chain jack on the shipped cable does not fit.  Luckily I'd brought an extra cable just in case.  A thin case worked just fine with the supplied daisy chain jack.\\n\\n4.  Finally, the price...the &#34;non airplane&#34; version of these is around $20-$25.  I paid $20 on top of that for the extra features which I don't really feel were worth it.\\n\\nOverall these are great headphones, they got us through a rough time but not without a few hiccups.","[]","B01FRN635A","B01FRN635A","AGPQZY5CE5IM5QOE72EGDXHCBFGQ","2017-01-02 19:26:01.000","26","True","505"
"108016","3","An Adequate Messenger/Laptop Bag For This Price","The &#34;Belkin Classic Pro Messenger Bag for Laptops up to 15.6&#34; is my latest effort to find the perfect messenger bag/laptop carrier/general tote bag for business trips.  While this bag has its pluses, overall, I find it to be an average messenger bag that may be worth the price as a value.  It comes in a heather gray with black trim lightweight canvas type material.  While its lines are minimal and clean, it is certainly not an eye catcher in a board room, although its coloring and styling does appear as a unisex unit.\\n\\nThe bag is large with twin zippered accordion style opening revealing two large internal pockets-none of which is particularly well padded-at least I would not want my tablet and laptop mishandled with the padding provided.  Indeed, the &#34;protective sleeve&#34; for your electronics has no strap or velcro strip to hold your unit stable while carrying it or transporting it.  The other internal department is large and roomy but again, not well padded and probably better for carrying books and files than equipment and loose items.  There is a smaller open pocket and a smaller narrow zippered mesh pocket that might be adequate for a passport or checkbook.\\n\\nIt has two large external pockets zippered pockets, capable of holding a small laptop or 12&#34; tablet but I again am concerned about the minimal padding.  It has an adjustable strap that cannot be removed and the connectors for the strap seem adequately sewn for the task-only time will tell if they handle the heavier loads.  It is very lightweight, only 1.2 lbs., and has a velcro strap on the back to link it to rolling luggage.  The hardware and zippers seem more than adequate and they open and close smoothly at this point.\\n\\nOverall, the &#34;Belkin Classic Pro Messenger Bag for Laptops up to 15.6&#34; seems to be an OK messenger/laptop bag for this price point.  Clearly my concerns center on the thin padding and minimal styling of the product.  But at this point, after only one weekend of use, I find it satisfactory; however, I am continuing my search for the perfect bag, one that is eye appealing, securely made and padded, and utilitarian in all its features.","[]","B071W8TY6J","B071W8TY6J","AGUC77RC74K7T2EZL3ICLZ25HFQA","2017-07-09 23:21:41.695","2","False","505"
"442764","4","New product that could be great ...","I've been a professional meteorologist over 40 years ... tornado chaser ... Air Force hurricane hunter ... extreme weather guy ...  Here in the heart of Tornado Alley nothing is more important to us than a reliable weather radio. We have trusted Midland for a long time and I think we've owned many of their consumer models. Here's a quick review of my new WR400 that arrived the day after Christmas:  THE GOOD. This Midland WR400 has great, sleek external design and should be a super alarm clock radio for most people. Some reviews said it was too bright for bedside. That is NOT true. The menu function allows about 10 levels of backlight  brightness and the low settings are great at night. The menu and operation are much easier and much improved over previous models ... the weather service’s SAME codes for your location are built in!  You can now exclude specific extraneous alerts that you do not want to hear. The speaker is good and the volume control is smooth. Reception for FM is good. NOAA weather radio reception is as good as the WR100 was. THE BAD.  Not much. AM reception beside the bed is always a problem and not that good due to electrical interference. The telescoping antenna is more problematic beside the bed, since it starts poking into lamps and such and hard to make look good. I got an external antenna, Sangean ANT 100, which is available on Amazon. THE UGLY. I did have a major issue when this radio arrived and my initial rating was only going to be two stars ... In the first hour of using the radio I was apparently the first to discover a flaw that would not allow the FM tuner to go higher than107.3, when my favorite station for OU football was 107.7. This radio, as it was shipped, would not tune up to 107.7!  I sent multiple complaints. THE RESPONSE AND FINAL RATING. Midland called me back about the FM tuner complaint and assured me they had validated my concern and would be working  a fix for the radio tuning problem for all of us. They did send a new one after a few months. The revised radio did arrive and corrected the tuner defect. The radio has been working fine. The reception is a bit weak and sensitive to positioning … something that may be caused by NOAA transmitter changes and issues. The external antenna fixed that. The whole solution is at least four stars now ...","[]","B071HFV836","B07KQ2TLXF","AHGCAHE3ND6OZ2BGPHXDDAH3OPOQ","2017-12-26 19:22:51.162","678","True","505"
"342190","2","Low Expectations Were Not Met.","I realize it's an inexpensive item and my expectations were not high, but... I've had many monitors with built-in speakers, and other than volume, this does not improve upon the worst of them. As a separate, rather large dedicated &#34;soundbar&#34; that requires connection to a usb port, I was hoping for at least a small step up from the sound I'd get from any typical monitor with built-ins. Nope. My gripes:\\n\\n1. The bass/lower frequencies are over-emphasised/amplified which is never good coming from very small, cheap speakers. This creates a distracting unbalanced sound. Kinda what mud would sound like if it could talk.\\n2. Even though the speakers are unobstructed and pointing directly at the listener, they sound &#34;muffled&#34; like most built-in speakers. I'm sure the emphasis on low frequencies contributes to this.\\n3. No on/off or mute button, just volume. It's connected via USB so there is no good excuse for this.\\n4. Requires a USB connection to my computer but offers none of functionality of a USB connection (see #3).\\n\\nThere is a tiny power-on led on the side of the &#34;soundbar&#34;. This LED is the best example of how little thought or care went into designing this product. Here's why.\\n1. You can't see it unless you look at the soundbar from the side.\\n2. It's OK that you can't see it because it serves NO purpose. You can't turn the soundbar off (see #3 above.) It stays on even if you turn off the monitor. The light even stays on if you turn off the computer...\\n3. But wait! As tiny as it is, it is impressively bright. Bright white no less. I didn't realize how bright until bedtime. It was after turning out the lights for bed that I first realized that this had a light on it. I got up and returned to my computer to confirm my first thought that, yes, it was actually bright enough to read by. So perhaps this is a feature? A built-in night light.\\n\\nDell can do better, and so can you. Even at this price point.","[]","B00DEJXRAE","B00DEJXRAE","AG7V6LNFRTALYDES4SBZVHJG4FSA","2017-08-23 15:58:09.671","3","True","505"

I have not put my bigger hard drive in it yet, but at least I know the DVR is capable of running without rebooting.  Upgraded to 4 stars.\\n\\nPrevious 2 star review:\\nI'm receiving my 3rd DVR in the mail today.  The first two developed constant rebooting problems, like up to 30 times in a day.  It's pretty hard to get quality monitoring when your DVR is down all the time.  I do not recommend this model.\\n\\nThe video also constantly shifts - the best way I can describe this.  The resolution or lighting changes, and the text overlay flips from small to large and back.  Every time it does this, the system sees that as a change worthy of generating an alert.  I have my system set to send emails with pictures around any alerts, and that means I get literally hundreds of emails a day from this.  I've tried tuning it down, and it seems my choices are to get hundreds of useless alerts and a couple valid alerts, thousands of useless alerts and most valid alerts, or no alerts.  Not happy with this logic.\\n\\nThe camera quality is very good.  The app for your phone is free and unlimited and works well, even if it's a little bit hard to decipher.\\n\\nIf you want to monitor remotely (outside of your home) via PC, there is a complicated process to follow, and I never got it to work.  Plus if you're doing it from say a work network, it's possible your access will be blocked by the corporate firewalls.\\n\\nKeep in mind that if you want to install more cameras you should probably upgrade the hard drive so you can have more than a day of saved video.  If you do upgrade the hard drive, contact QSEE and get their list of approved hard drives since they will say that all your problems are because you have upgraded the hard drive.  The one it comes with is good for about 3 days of video with the 8 cams they provide.\\n\\nOverall, I do not recommend this system,  If my 3rd DVR does not solve my problem, I'm returning it and looking at another brand like Lorex or Swann.","[]","B00XQBD5WU","B00XQBD5WU","AFGSHDM4XWPZ44KFN4UWD7OZPLDQ","2017-03-09 19:09:13.000","0","False","505"

Was content with the iPhone SE's internal DAC and thought that my ALAC music file collection sounded great through it and my couple-years-old Nuts Swagga Studio headphones, but the plethora of positive professional and owner reviews combined with a desire for an elevated listening experience swayed me to purchase the DragonFly Red.  Considering myself a budget audiophile, the essentially $200 price of the Red became a self-imposed price limit on my first stand-alone DAC.\\n\\nThe first song played through the Red was Alpha 9's Come Home (Original Mix, featuring Paul Van Dyk).  Started off listening through the iPhone SE's internal DAC via the headphone jack and was thinking that it sounded great and I just wasted my money on the Red.  Then, switched the headphones to the Red, took a deep breath, and just about jumped through the roof!\\n\\nThrough the Red, the bass was significantly deeper and more defined, the highs were far higher and much more crisp, pristine, and real.  It was as if the music came ALIVE and grew a soul!  Tingles went down my spine, my level of excitement instantly went from 10 to 10,000, and I was grinning and laughing so loudly that my wife thought I was engaged in some sort of torrid love affair!  She came over, sat beside me, and had that 'what the heck' look on her face.  I gave her the same exact sound test...headphones in the iPhone SE followed by headphones in the Red.  She was grinning just as much as I was!\\n\\nIt was akin to a veil (or two or three) being lifted and the music suddenly exploding from a confined box into crisp, brisk, and crystal clear morning air!  The music mutated from a dull thud into an ecstatic parade of pure audio rapture!  You could see into the music, feel its glory, and experience its dripping wet enthusiasm!  It was an escape from Alcatraz, a weekend in Vegas, and a sweet pastry all wrapped up in your ears!\\n\\nNow, life has meaning (don't tell the wife) and my ears will never sanction going back to anything less than the DragonFly Red.\\n\\nThe DragonFly Red is amazing!

"847162","5","Excellent in-wall speaker for the price!","Excellent in-wall speaker for the price.  We have used them as rear/surrounds in small-ish and medium-sized rooms with fantastic results.\\n\\nLike most similarly-priced in-wall speakers, this model (and others from Polk) do not have integrated enclosures (a box-like structure made of thin material, similar to a traditional speaker cabinet).  The lack of an enclosure means that much of the sound energy dissipates behind the speaker and gets lost inside the wall cavity.\\n\\nManufacturers claim that they take wall cavities into account when designing this type of in-wall speaker -- and that the space between wall studs functions like an oversized speaker cabinet.  The problem is that studs often have holes or gaps, especially in big cities like NYC where metal studs (with large pre-punched holes every foot or two) are required by code, even in residential buildings.\\n\\nAnyway, this speaker sounds surprisingly good and while a lot of sound does seem to disappear within the wall, plenty of sound gets to the listener in the room.  We add foam inserts inside the wall about a foot above and below the speaker, and that helps.\\n\\nA nice feature on this model is that the tweeter is mounted in a gimbal, allowing the tweeter to be aimed at an angle -- very handy for tweaking directionality without the hassle of cutting another hole and moving the speaker in case the initial placement is not perfect (or if you change your furniture or room layout down the road).\\n\\nIf you don't have budget constraints then consider more expensive &#34;audiophile&#34; brands like Sonance or Definitive, as many of their in-wall speakers have integrated enclosures, nicer speaker components, and better crossover circuitry.  But expect to pay 5x to 10x as much for those fancy in-wall speakers that may or may not sound slightly better to listeners with critical ears.  Just keep in mind that many, many factors are involved -- particularly the size and proportions of the room, furniture and cabinets in the room, windows and doors, amplifiers and other equipment used in the system, etc.\\n\\nFor the vast majority of home theatre owners, these would be a great choice for a small or small-to-medium room.  For larger rooms, look at Polk's 265-RT.","[]","B004L9DGDE","B088D569JG","AF43WIOZOPY4W4JLQP4DCFIDQ77A","2017-03-27 15:45:21.000","6","True","505"

"598962","3","Amazon is the master of cutting corners just right","Amazon appears to have cut corners by just the right amount to make this the biggest bargain of the year* (caveats discussed below). The screen, audio, and battery life are all reasonably good. The tablet itself appears to be made from plastic that is reasonably good, however, the buttons feel very cheap and poorly put together. Despite having a low-end Mediatek processor and 1.5 GB of RAM, the performance is better than acceptable. Both cameras are pathetic - not that I recommend anyone to use cameras on tablets. This means a poor experience when video calling. I was originally very hesitant to try Fire OS especially coming from the unadulterated Android experience I get from my Nexus 7. While I can understand Amazon's decision to cut corners on the hardware, removing some basic functionality in the software does not make any sense to me. If it matters to you, you cannot cast (Miracast / Chromecast) your screen to a Chromecast / Roku (understandable since these are direct competitors to Amazon's Fire stick). I can cast from Youtube to both devices so the hardware is clearly capable of this functionality but Amazon has sabotaged this feature. I have the ad-supported version - the ads are mostly non-intrusive but lock-screen widget functionality (changing tracks / seeing calendar appointments, mail tickers etc.) is sadly absent and dearly missed - this is an example of the basic functionality that Amazon removed from Android. Perhaps worst of all is the Amazon app store which is like a ghost town. You are extremely likely to find most of the popular applications missing. Fortunately, it is possible to load Google's Play store and gain access to all the apps you want. However, for all but the technically savvy, I would recommend staying away from this tablet for this very reason. Be warned that Gmail, Inbox and a few other apps do not work at all (the stock email app does just fine for me). Also, you cannot add more than one google account. I found it easier to simply do a factory reset than figure out how to add more than one google account to the tablet. For all the corners that amazon has cut, you simply cannot get anything even remotely this good for $50. I consider this tablet a good buy only so long as we have access to the google Play store and side-loading applications (this is its saving grace). If this feature was removed, it would be extremely difficult for me to recommend this tablet.","[]","B01J94SWWU","B01J94SWWU","AFORL3ZGSGFYBH25NL76DSB7XH5Q","2017-12-09 04:03:42.119","1","True","505"

Let me tell you...\\n\\n+Speed:\\nReaching 450mb\\s write/read speeds is about 5 times faster than most of the best external HDD out there. It is even twice faster than the internal builtin SSD on my computer. I even choose to run games from the Samsung T3 than from my internal computer SSD. That is just how good it is.\\n\\n+Size and form factor:\\nIt is small. How small? I could fit two of these one next to each other in the palm of my hand. It is somehow the width of a credit card and about 10% shorter. Thicknes, that is a different thing. Its about 50% thicker than an Iphone 6. Not the slimmest but its good enough so that you can even put it in a wallet.\\n\\n+Look & Feel / Materials:\\nHalf metal half plastic. Both with a nice finish. It looks premium and feels premium. The printed Samsung logo might wear out pretty fast though since it is simple ink and maybe it should have been laser engraved or something alike.\\n\\nThe really not so good:\\n\\n-Cable:\\nMade of nice thick rubber probably with very good shielding inside. This cable is sturdy and looks like it will last to survive the test of time. Problem is, its really sturdy. Too sturdy. So stiff that it feels almost as if it has a repurposed clothes hanger inside of it and it is so big that honestly kind of kills the whole achievement of the drive itself being so small. For those minimalists out there, you WILL want to go for an aftermarket cable than carrying this one with you.\\n\\n-Price:\\nFor the same ammount of money you can easily find a DIY m2 SSD + a case that not only you choose to your liking but also you can always tear down to repurpose to then old SSD and upgrade it whenever you want at a fraction of the cost of purchasing an entire new. Not to mention the cable option i just pointed out which adds to this concept. Maybe Samsung should consider lowering a little the price on these to make them more convenient.\\n\\nOver all: You can't go wrong getting one of these.

Mounted to the window with either the included mount or the optional suction cup mount, the videos are of high quality, even at nighttime.\\n\\nI have a couple of nits though. First, it continually about every other week, corrupts the SD Card. Now, I'm not using the included Samsung 16gb but I am using the same brand EVO 32gb card. So shouldn't be any problem recording video. And for the most part, it's fine -- then inexplicably, it'll alert and say it can't write to the video card. At that point everything stored there is toast, and I have to reformat it, and then it's OK again for several weeks.\\n\\nSecond issue -- phone connectivity. I'm using an Android Nexus 6. When you go through the connection process it will connect to the Goluk and the video will be available on the phone for review -- both the live cam and the stored videos. But as soon as I exit the car and then come back in, the Goluk will reconnect to my phone (it says it's connected) but it will not transmit or show video. To fix, I have to forget the Goluk network at the phone level, then find it again, enter the wiFi password again and reconnect just like the first time -- every single time.  Really annoying.\\n\\nAnother time, something went wrong on boot of the unit and it sat there saying &#34;Hi ... Goluk&#34; (pause 15 seconds) repeat,  &#34;Hi ... Goluk&#34;  repeat  &#34;Hi ... Goluk&#34;  repeat for almost 10 minutes. Even after I pulled the plug.  That was nice driving down the freeway.\\n\\nAlso, the instructions are extremely poor. There's quite a number of settings that have no explanation of what they do.  Take the G Sensor settings.  Sure there are 3 options there -- but what do they actually *mean*? Not a clue.  Or the parking modes. And so on. How to turn off the absolutely annoying chimes (try downloading multiple videos and have *both* the Goluk and your phone chime for every 3 minute clip downloaded at full volume in unison like you just won the price is right.)","[]","B01KX35KB2","B01KX35KB2","AHKTYNOKHZE77YCF5BSVBNXQLGRQ","2017-06-30 13:17:20.370","1","True","505"

Being old fashioned, it was VERY difficult to find a decent &#34;stereo component system&#34; with a multi-player CD built in, with AM/FM, that even plays cassette tapes (I think I have one or two laying around somewhere). Doesn't play 8 tracks (I think) and no turntable, but I have that somewhere else (yes, I still have vinyl).  Only &#34;con&#34; so far - the speaker wires are exactly 46&#34; long - so if you want your speakers more than three feet away from the main unit, get some bell wire, electrical tape, and wire strippers.  It took me about 30 minutes to set the thing up where I wanted it. Today's normal teenager would not be able to set this thing up (just kidding). The AM and FM reception is good  - no fading out, etc.  And you can set stations. There are separate external antennas for both AM and FM.  Everything I wanted to do so far I found (eventually) in the instruction manual.  The print is VERY small.  It's another device where you will probably not use 50% of the functionality.  I know I won't.  The sound, however, is surprisingly good - better than the old &#34;component system&#34; it replaced.  I've had Sharp products before and liked them.  Playing five CDs right now on &#34;ALL REPEAT&#34; mode - ya gotta read the manual to figure out how. Sinatra sounds good. The &#34;x-bass&#34; mode works well, sounds good.  Using the remote you can adjust the bass/treble settings.  Took me awhile to find the CD &#34;open/close&#34; button - NOT on the remote - only on the unit itself.  But that almost makes sense since you will be inserting/removing CDs and you can't do that remotely.  The black cases look good. It has a USB port so you can play your music from a flash drive.

I have had these for over 6 months and with heavy use they are still going strong. These earbuds are all about sound quality, they don't have the gimmicks of other earbuds and only strive for good sound. They feel pretty comfortable, and the metal casing feels nice and sturdy. The mic is ok on these, they work fine for phone calls and I even used them with my PS4 for a while. Its not as good as a real mic but it gets the job done. The packaging is actually some of the best I've ever seen, and it just adds to the feel of the earbuds as quality. They provide you with every size earbud gel you can think of, in both foam and rubber. My only issue with that is the there is only one pair of each, and as of right now to way to order more of one size. The case for these is well made and I actually used it for a while. Compared to beats they are so much better its almost unreal. Beats earbuds which cost $50 dollars more sound horrible and bass heavy compared to these. These are clean and well made. The cord is braided so it lasts a long time, feels nice and doesn't transfer vibrations.\\n\\nUpdate: After using these heavily for close to a year, they are still working just as good as they did at the start, the metal mesh on the right ear fell out but the design of the gels make so that nothing gets in anyway. Also I recently found out that you can email the company directly and they will mail you replacement gels, incredible costumer service. I never expected these to last this long but I'm glad they did.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nGreat balanced sound\\nDurable\\nWide selection of gels\\nLots of useful accessories\\nFeel good even after long periods of use\\nGreat customer service\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nLacks a bit of bass kick (personal preference)\\nCan distort at very high volume, but stays clean longer than most earbuds\\n\\nThis is great pair of earbuds for people who want high end want sound quality over hype for a reasonable price.","[]","B01KB9K9Z0","B08RTN8KZC","AH2XE4MNGYCD42THRAAUA5VXBWNQ","2017-08-06 05:53:26.793","0","False","505"

The product is pretty solid, true that it doesn't have the  longest range without any modifications(but the truth is you aren't legally supposed to fly , but in line of sight ?), you can't even see it.. getting anywhere close a mile away... (children)... lol.

So use your own judgement about this drone  ,I have despite the reviews (allot of the negative reviews of this product are very uncalled for, that I have read).

"617045","4","Supply Your Own Swear Words","I've installed these on two tablets, and my best advice is to not use the three &#34;hinge&#34; stickers. The directions tell you that before peeling the protective skin off the screen protector, put the protector on the tablet and align it. Then, use the &#34;hinge&#34; stickers (3 smaller-than-credit-card sized rectangular stickers) at one long edge of the protector - stick one side to the edge of the protector and then wrap it around the edge of the tablet. So, after you do that, the protector will open like a door. Then, open the door (lift the non-hinged side of the protector), clean the tablet screen, peel the protective skin off in the inside of the protector, and then close the door (lower the protector onto the tablet screen).\\n\\nThere are a couple problems with the hinge stickers. They are not sticky enough. So, when you peel the protective skin off the protector, there's a good chance the protector will separate from the hinges. Also, the hinges are just thin stickers, so they don't hold the protector in perfect alignment - meaning that after you remove the protective skin and then lower the protector onto your screen, it will not necessarily align correctly onto the tablet screen.\\n\\nAfter fumbling around with both tablet applications and cursing aloud (repeatedly), I did not use the hinge stickers. I just removed the protective skin being careful not to touch the underside of the protector, and then slowly lowered it onto the screen. Made it much easier, but you must be careful not to touch the underside of the protector.\\n\\nMinus one star for the pain in the neck.\\n\\nHaving said all that, it's a GREAT screen protector - far better than the soft type. The screen is very vivid and no issues at all with the sensitivity of the touch screen. The first one I applied was for a child's tablet over a year ago, which gets heavy, daily usage. It still looks great without any snags, yellowing, or scratches. Just wipe of the peanut butter, grease, and boogers, and it looks like new. That's why I very recently purchased the second one for the new tablet (mine).\\n\\nIn summary, a great protector that will be great for you if you're patient while installing it.","[]","B00U43F99A","B00U43F99A","AHYBWEKNO7O5AIKCOFGV2VGP36PA","2017-02-11 00:49:10.000","0","True","505"

The Stereo in my 2000 Dodge Caravan failed and I was looking for a lower cost replacement for it.  This unit showed a lot of features for the price and I liked the idea of the built in GPS.  What a shame it was to open the box and see that it's wiring harness was completely useless.  Instead of having the head unit plug on one end and bare labeled wires on the other to connect to the vehicles wiring or to a vehicle specific adapter that I already have, it comes with a connector on both ends.  The one end is for the head unit and I have no idea what the other end fits.  While there is a picture of it on Amazon, there is nothing in the description that I saw that said that you would need yet another adapter to plug into this connector so I now have a head unit that is USELESS.  Sure, I could cut the unknown useless connector off of the harness and connect the wires to my existing adapter but if this head unit is defective, how would I return it then.\\n\\nHow hard would it have been to put in the description that the radio harness is designed to fit vehicle X and adapter Y is also required to install the head unit in any other vehicle.  The Pyle web site is also pretty much useless unless all you want to do is register the unit or send it in for repair.  I may try and do some research to see what adapter may fit this but it may just be easier to send it back and get a real radio that actually fits multiple vehicles.\\n\\n***********  update  2/11/17  ***********\\nA bit of research showed that the output connector of the radio harness is just a 16 pin ISO connector but why they did that is beyond me.  I ordered the proper adapter to connect it to yet another adapter and installed it.  So far, the head unit seems to be ok.  The sound is good connected to the factory speakers.  I was surprised that this radio does not have RDS on the FM stations with that large screen but I seldom look at it anyway.  The GPS seems to work well but the antenna installation may prove to be difficult.  I have moved the rating from 1 to 3 stars now that it is installed and working and may further update once the radio is in use for a while.","[]","B01GNL6VHK","B01GNL6VHK","AGBLNSXYZZDTUDQVKTOVSS6JDRLA","2017-02-08 00:02:41.000","2","True","505"

The metal is not flat, and has worn the device where the high spot of the magnet is touching the surface.\\n\\ni was pleasantly surprised when i received mine (i bought the blue/black one). some of the pics on amazon made me worry it might be less than perfectly assembled, but the 'canvas' is solidly glued down and the 'leatherette' is very nice looking as well. the suedish interior should be quite nice to the kobo, and the magnet seems to be doing its job reliably.\\n\\nthe cradle that the reader lies in seems very secure (it covers it on all 4 sides). i worry that it might be difficult to remove, but as that would probably not happen unless i were buying another cover it's probably not ever going to be an issue for me.\\n\\nnow for the quibbles. while the plastic surround for the reader itself is very solid, the cardboard of the 'book' seems maybe a little flimsy. it'll probably hold up well, but i'd feel better if it were a little more resistant to bending. and my only issue with it cosmetically concerns the closing magnet. first, it's a little weak to hold the cover closed, but i suspect that was necessary to keep it from activating the autosleep when the cover is folded back behind the reader. but my real problem is that the metal of the magnet is just folded over the edge of the cover and crimped into place very unevenly. it lends a sort of crinkly tinfoil look to the magnet on the outside, detracting from what is otherwise a very attractive cover.\\n\\nif it weren't for the reynolds-wrap look of that closure, i'd have to give it a full 5 stars. everything else about this cover just looks perfect. makes my old nook cover look cheezy by comparison, and it cost about half as much!\\n\\ni've attempted to upload a picture showing the closure magnet. hopefully its irregularity comes through in the photo. i think it also gives an idea as to the overall quality of the case...it's a strange mix of a well-thought-out case with a cheap magnet that seems added as an afterthought.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41vIeCta-0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41vIeCta-0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41vIeCta-0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61exPsYtq6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61exPsYtq6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61exPsYtq6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B075GX121Q","B08B61DQNK","AHYZC76JKBTXR4TBB2C6CZ4INARA","2017-10-20 22:44:16.930","2","True","505"

I had been between this and a HP Envy all in one 27 in. However, the specs weren't significantly different, but this one had a much better price. Plus my wife liked the look of the design better, and I'm glad we went with this one, it looks fantastic in our office. No complaints with the operating system so far, overall it has been very smooth, had a couple hiccups with some updates but that is more of a Windows problem. It was very easy to set up out of the box, does not require any sort of assembly. Touchscreen is very responsive, although I don't use that function as much. It does come with a wireless mouse and keyboard, this does require that you use a USB port for this. The keyboard could be a little bigger or nicer at this price, but at least you have one included and it is wireless. However, there are 4 total, 3 on the back and one on the bottom front. In addition to the 3 USB ports on the back, there is the power outlet, a network in port, and HDMI out port. I am pretty impressed with the sound quality, essentially the entire bottom inch is a built in speaker. It has a nice design element to it. Also there is a CD/DVD drive on the right side of the monitor.\\n\\nProbably the only gripe I have with this computer is the placement of the &#34;front&#34; accessible USB port, headphone jack, SD card reader, and USB-C port. They are on the bottom edge of the screen. Several other reviews on here talk about this being bad placement, and now that I've had this for a while, I agree. The monitor unfortunately doesn't tip back far enough to easily see where the ports are, plus if you have a thumb drive that is long, its going to be very difficult to have it even fit without tipping the screen back. I've actually had to leave the little sticker on that shows where all the ports are so I'm not guessing where to plug something in. I understand from a design perspective it would not have looked as nice to have these on the side of the monitor, but it is far more functional this way. That being said, I wouldn't let this be a deal breaker for you if you're considering this computer, I'm overall very happy with this purchase.","[]","B01N2434WP","B01N2434WP","AG6TOM6OTILKSIT6ZWTT4JNW3CIA","2017-12-16 15:19:20.243","10","True","505"

One of my goals was to be able to import videos from my drone and while in the field be able to make quick edits to videos using my iPad. The My Cloud app has no problem talking to the Photos application if you want to offload images and videos to the HDD, but they have completely left functionality out to be able to save video files (or images) to the photos application on the iPad. (With images there is a workaround that you can share an image to a third party app and then share it to Photos from there, but My Cloud has no support to share a video from the HDD)\\n\\nImporting from SD card- The first couple SD cards imported without issue and fairly quickly. When it came to the third one, I inserted it like the previous ones, and let it be. When I came back I assumed it had finished since it was no longer doing anything, but when I plugged the HDD into a colleagues computer to offload the files I discovered they were not there. I put that SD card into his computer only to discover the HDD had corrupted the first video file to where it was no longer useful.\\n\\nThe Firmware- I have no idea if this is expected behavior with this, but about every 10-15 minutes of use the system will crash and all lights on the device will blink repeatedly. The only way to fix it is to power off the device and power it back on. This is a rather frustrating &#34;feature&#34;. I read on WD's website that formatting it for HFS+ can make it more stable, but after doing it, the My Cloud app shows errors for every option it offers.

I have a simple unit that just holds (4) AA NiMh batteries and a couple of chargers for R/C battery packs. What I love about this charger is how it charges each cell individually. Well I only have a bunch of AA NiMh batteries, but Tenergy also a gave me a pair of T35U 18650, 3.6V 3500mAh 10A Rechargeable Li-ion batteries. You see, they gave the charger and batteries to me at no cost at all for me to do a review. Well, if I thought it was a bad product I would give it an honest bad review. But I'm giving it an honest great review because I really like this charger!\\n\\nThis charger does (3) batteries chemistries, NiCad, NiMh and Lipos and several different cell sizes too. You can mix sizes and chemistries together while charging and/or testing.\\n\\nSo I started out learning the charger by just charging my batteries. You can select different rates for charging depending if you have smaller or larger cells. I like the fact that this charger automatically know what battery chemistry to charge for. My R/C chargers require you to set them up for the battery chemistry and charge rate. What it can do (which is something like my Lipo R/C charger) is balance the cells. The R/C charger only does this with special packs which have to be balanced. (that makes sure each individual cell is fully charged without overcharging any of the other cells). Well because this charger charges each loose cell individually it in effect is a balance charger, and it does it for all battery chemistries, although this is especially important for Lipos.\\n\\nNext I started with the TEST mode which at first charges the batteries, then discharges them and then recharges them. You can find your bad cells that way too. I found two I had (2) bad AA NiMh cells. When they all finished each cell display will tell you &#34;Full&#34;. Just add, this charger has a USB charge port on it too.\\n\\nIt works great on the Lipo batteries too. I just set it for a higher amp charge 700mA and charged away.","[]","B00SNWMQ40","B00SNWMQ40","AEMLSMJVRCR6FPNYWKS4S4X4GNAA","2017-07-11 16:43:51.133","1","False","505"

It is fast, responsive, and most importantly feels comfortable in my hands.  It has a 4-way clickable scroll wheel, a mechanical button to adjust scroll wheel responsiveness, back/forward buttons and an extra hidden button that are all programmable in Logitech's software.  If like me, you can't figure out where that hidden button is from Logitech's misleading documentation - you just press on the side where your thumb naturally rests.\\n\\nI also particularly liked the idea* of being able to quickly switch between devices.\\n\\nWhat I don't like, and was not clear from the product description, is that for bluetooth connectivity this device requires a BT 4.0 / LE / &#34;Smart&#34; receiver.  I was hoping to use this seamlessly for my Desktop via the Unifying receiver, and with both my personal and work laptops (not at the same time) via built-in Bluetooth like I can happily do using my Logitech K480 keyboard that I purchased last year.\\n\\nUnfortunately, neither laptop supports BLE and therefore this multi-device support is useless for me.  And no, I do not have any intention of swapping/adding dongles with those laptops.\\n\\nThis is the first time I've ever seen the marketing term &#34;Bluetooth Smart&#34; - though I am well aware of BT 4.0 / or BT LE (low-energy) technology/terms and understand why they would want to use it.  If the product description had simply said that, I would have noticed it right away and may not have purchased this particular mouse (this feature was a selling point for me), or at a minimum not been annoyed to discover that it didn't work when I was trying to get some work done from home.  I find it to be outright deceptive that the industry (Logitech is only partly to blame here) has THREE different names for the same protocol, and one that is such a subtle and rarely used variation that the uninitiated can easily miss the distinction.\\n\\nNote: I would rate the hardware alone as 5-stars.  The confusing documentation (it shouldn't take an effort to figure out where an extra button is, and what another one does) and misleading Bluetooth marketing are each causes for me to dock it a star.","[]","B01LF37K80","B01LF37K80","AHQJRZLTQPEU4Q6MTSDSFCPADUJQ","2017-11-21 03:08:41.339","5","True","505"
"597323","5","Great Board For My First Ryzen Build","Just built my Ryzen system not too long ago, this MSI Motherboard has been solid. With the LED boot up test lights to the red LED ambient lights made me have to build a red and black theme lol. I do like the suite of MSI software, though I don't have all of them installed. I only use the MSI Live Update app and the Gaming app. Those help me keep the motherboard software updated, control the LED lights and put my cpu in silent mode or gaming mode. I have tried the OC mode in the gaming app but it doesn't seem like it is doing anything. So I'll stick to doing the overclocking myself.\\nThe only real set back that I faced was the initial Memory compatibility for Ryzen. I had to wait for the bios update that had the new AGESA microcode. For a bit I could only hit 2667mhz on my G.Skill Ripjaw V DDR4 3200 kit. As of right now I can run 3200mhz and has been running smooth. That's pretty much it, everything has been plug and play. No real headaches.\\n\\nThe main reasons I decided on buying this board is to build a smaller computer and that has crossfire capability. B350 chipset doesn't natively support crossfire, but MSI was nice enough to set up a version of it through a pcie 2.0. I have yet to test it out, because of the current price craze of graphics cards. So I'll update this review when I get to that.\\n\\nOne minor con or glitch, is the lack of bios download option through the LIVE Update app. I say glitch because the LIVE update app can recognize your bios version, but I'm not sure if it was meant to download the newest bios or not. I Understand there is a procedure to doing the Flash. I think it would be nice if I can actually download the newest bios within the app, instead of having to go to the website ever so often to look for an update.\\n\\nThe only real con, at the time of purchase, is the lack of selection of X370 chipset (with native crossfire) for MATX form factor on all motherboard vendors. So, as I previously mentioned MSI helped us out a bit. If I had to pay a bit more for it i would have and if wanted to build with a Full ATX board I would have waited for Threadripper.","[]","B06XP1L1VG","B084LT1FJT","AG2DWWPT632F7ZS4L7KCJMSMQGQA","2017-07-13 21:41:22.454","1","True","505"

You need to have a router no matter what if you want to communicate with the camera by laptop/smartphone. For offgrid, i used an old clearwire voyage hotspot as it very small, battery powered (via usb), however since this doesn't have an ethernet port (and you need an ethernet port to **initially** setup the link between the camera and the wi-fi hub, you'll also need an ethernet/wi-fi repearer like the LB-Link MP01 (cheap). Once you've setup the camera to talk to the wi-fi hub from the iPhone app (settings-&#62;wi-fi), you can disregard the ethernet link and connect to the camera over wifi, even if the hub loses power the camera will reconnect when the hub/router comes back online.\\n\\nI found also good is that once you've setup the camera, you can access the camera remotely from your smartphone over 3g/4g simply by opening the app, that's pretty neat.\\n\\nI have some suggestions however;\\n\\n1. You should be able to select the recording length to the SD card when motion sensitivity triggers an alarm. Right now it seems hard fixed at 15 seconds. That setting should be any length you want. Maybe you can change this via a pc, but it's not changeable in the app.\\n\\n2. It would be nice to not need a hub/router and be able to connect directly from a smartphone to the camera unit.\\n\\n3. I wish the base of the camera could swivel 360 degrees for changing the direction the camera is pointing once installed.\\n\\nRegardless, for the price, the camera is great and the SD recording is great for offgrid/no-internet. Software is easy to use and reliable.","[]","B074M7B4BF","B074M7B4BF","AHAALOBY5IRURIXBKWUB4ZSMI4NA","2017-10-22 03:30:49.957","0","True","505"
"790517","3","Great concept that fails to deliver.","It's... okay. The build quality is good enough. The range is *abysmal* (particularly in RF mode) for something that's advertised to be used in the living room. It's called a &#34;gaming&#34; M&K, but I would never recommend anyone use it for gaming, especially the mouse. Laptop-style chiclet keys are annoying at best, but I knew what I was getting into there when I bought it so that one's on me. There is no backlight for the keys and the caps are unnecessarily shiny, and while the green labels look nice, they make it nearly impossible to read if your overhead lighting hits it at the right angle (which of course mine does, the *exact* right angle), even during the daytime. The mouse... oh the mouse. It's too small, and my hands are probably below average size. It's too light, even with the magnetic resistance. It's very finicky compared to the keyboard in both BT and RF mode. Sometimes it takes up to about 10 seconds to decide it wants to connect after waking it up from standby in BT mode, which is unacceptable when the keyboard reconnects in less than a few seconds. It also randomly stops responding in BT mode at least a couple of times an hour for about 5-10 seconds, so I have to wiggle it until it starts moving again, not exactly ideal for any kind of less than casual gaming. If you're more than 6 feet from the receiver, don't even bother trying to use the mouse in RF mode because 50% of the time it won't even move. I will say it's nice to have the flexibility to flip a switch to go from BT to RF on the fly for UEFI configuration and such, so it's got that going for it.\\n\\nAll in all, this is a great concept for us HTPC users and couch gamers who refuse to use a console, but sadly as there is no real competition in this particular space, this is about the only option (and it's not a very awesome one). This thing is way *way* too expensive for what it does. At about half the price it's currently at, I'd probably add a star to the review because of the &#34;get what you pay for&#34; factor, but when I pay a premium price for something, I expect a premium experience, which this is not.","[]","B01D04YU94","B01D04YU94","AEPNCNCOLWOX5V6FGEJQMFVX6YIQ","2017-06-23 17:25:13.977","1","True","505"
"785941","2","GREAT but NOT 4K GREAT","I’ve had the drive for several months now, have tried and / or used most of its features. The BIG problem for me, and why the 3 stars, is the microSD card. I have microSDs in my Canon and Sony digital cameras and this drive does not work with the SD card adapter and there isn’t a microSD port in the drive itself. This renders it pretty useless if you intend to backup 4K video on microSD in the field...and if you’re using an iPhone (and some tablets) you can’t transfer a 4K video at all. The best I have been able to backup in field is 1080p / mp4. I can backup 4K but I have to transfer it to my laptop first so why would I lug a drive and a laptop around?  No trouble at all backing up any .jpg photos (only moved raw by Android tablet) but you have to transfer to your phone or tablet first using the devices software then move to the Asus drive.\\n\\nFor general backup and file organizing on my Sony laptop (which recognized the drive immediately), for remote wireless file viewing from my Android tablet and IPhone 6s, the drive works great. The iPhone and Android tablet apps were not so intuitive for me at first but after figuring a few things out I found them to work well. Same for wireless connectivity, I had some trouble figuring it out.\\n\\nRecommend the ZIPSAFE Mobile Printer / Camera Hard Case Fits Polaroid ZIP Mobile...the Asus drive fits this case well and was only $16 on Amazon.\\n\\nAll in all It’s a great drive but not for field backup of 4K video which was the main reason I purchased it. The 4K files are huge and the microSD cards are expensive so for me overall it’s a redundant disappointment and saved me $0 but I am happy that all my photos and videos are now safely backed up and easily accessible.\\n\\nAdd On: After going around and around with 2 different ASUS CSRs that were telling me my drive should be working, they simply stopped being concerned about it. The problem is still there, it is real, and apparently it is not going away! I'm dropping another star on this product rating due to the amount of time and effort I put into assisting them only to have been left hanging with the issue unresolved.","[]","B01LZJNTDB","B01LZJNTDB","AEY3PCMGZVCE3YRGLHLRYY6UCOFQ","2017-10-24 21:48:58.072","4","True","505"
"367934","2","Not as durable as I thought","These headphones have great sound quality for the price. The bass response is very good. I was looking for headphones that are warm but these might be a little too warm for me. I would like a little more high end but that is my only complaint.\\n\\nThey also have very good sound isolation when you use the foam tips. Listening to good quality sound without outside sounds interfering is awesome. You can get very immersed in the music with these. However these tips need to be squished, like you would ear plugs, prior to being put in the ear which requires two hands and is irritating if you tend to take your earphones in and out all day.\\n\\nI find these uncomfortable to wear. The few inches of the wire from where they plug into the ear buds is supposed to have &quot;memory&quot; so that you can shape it around the ear. I find that it doesn't have enough memory and I'm constantly fighting to keep the wires around my ear. They tend to loose shape, pop up and fall from my ear. Having the wires just hang directly is not an option because they are too heavy and will pull the buds out of my ear. The design would be greatly improved with a more solid rubber or plastic piece to go behind the ears.\\n\\nMy first impression was that they are very durable. The wires are thick and seem much more robust than your average headphone wires. The plastic of the buds also feels very solid and well constructed. I have a feeling you could step on these and they wouldn't break. I assumed they would last me for years. Six months after buying them, sound started to crackle and cut with movement. The insulation around the part of the wire just before the jack completely cracked and caused this issue with the sound and rendered the headphones unusable unless I plan not to move while listening. Because the wires unplug from the buds, I might be able to buy replacement wires but I haven't looked into it because they were so inconvenient to use I'm not interested in using them anyway.\\n\\nFor me, earbuds are for mobile, on the go use and should be durable. I thought these would fit the bill but they let me down. They are also inconvenient and uncomfortable, especially if you need to take them out and put them in frequently. Because of these factors, I will never purchase another pair again, despite the great sound quality.","[]","B004PO10E2","B0C3GM8JQC","AGTOMJN5ZNECPCNHYOSBFNDV3YWA","2017-07-24 16:30:32.095","43","True","505"
"314451","5","Minimalist yet Practical","Just arrived today.  I'll update this review as time goes on.  I had some very specific reasons for this purchase.  One, I'm 68 years old now and I have no intention of carrying the same loads as I did when I was in college.  Second, I live in a place that is not abundant with photographic opportunities, so I don't shoot nearly as often as I did when I lived in the Eastern US, with its lush forests and bodies of water. I have to drive for a couple of hours to find something worthy of a photo.\\n\\nNow, about the bag.  It's built like a tank.  You can feel the quality the moment you sling it over your left shoulder. I stuffed my Pentax DSLR with short zoom attached, a rather slow 20-210 zoom lens, a triplet set of old  fashioned metal extension tubes, and a short macro lens. The bag held everything with maybe room for my phone or snack. Still a bit heavy for an old man. I ditched the long zoom and the extension tubes and voila!  Just right!\\n\\nThere's a nifty pocket for your keys, a pen and pad or phone and a snack. There's also a flat pocket for your (8 inch or smaller) tablet, if you need it. I also found the built in rain cover.  Nice when traveling back East when thunderstorms can hit without warning. (And they will) I will never forget strolling though a DC neighborhood when suddenly, we were drenched in what seemed a never ending storm with no raincoat or anything. The tablet sleeve will always carry a packable rain poncho, just in case.\\n\\nThis pack is not for the person who is heading out for a full-blown photo expedition and needs to carry a lot of gear. It is made for the photographer who is heading out for a day on the trail or a day on the city streets. Let's be real. Who in his right mind wants to carry 75 lbs of camera gear all day?\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, the bag is built like a tank but very light weight.  It's a versatile pack with limited space, but if you plan well and want to limit yourself to the essentials and pack light, this bag will probably serve you quite well.  As an added bonus, 2 day shipping is free for prime members!","[]","B0723CSB56","B07NL4R7B3","AFDJMH24C4FDWOYNL2CVZL4TPI2Q","2017-09-17 22:26:36.686","31","True","505"
"686480","4","Viewpoints from a portrait mode cult member","I use my computer monitor in portrait mode. I have been using a Dell Ultrasharp 20&#34; 4:3 for 10 years and in general still am happy with it. Despite the occasional size envy, I was not tempted to move to 16:9 1080p because that would be a downgrade from 1200p. With the advent of UHD, I no longer have an excuse for resisting upgrade. The choice for portrait monitors is severely limited (I don't want to go the route of an after-market stand). I almost bought the Dell P2715q, but the lack of the Ultrasharp designation made me fear I was trading down. Finally I settled on this LG, despite it losing to the Dell in connectivity and having only HDMI 2.0.\\n\\nImmediately after setting it up, I found a few small gripes. First is the limited height adjustment. In portrait mode, the monitor can only be moved up or down for 30mm (a little over an inch), instead of 120mm as in the specs. It turns out to be not a real issue for me, as the monitor is rather tall. Sitting 3 ft from it, I already need to look up to see the top of portrait. Even if the stand were taller to allow a bigger adjustment, I probably would just set the monitor near the lowest position. The second complain, the lack of vertical swivel on the stand, may not be as annoying to you, especially if you don't need to turn the monitor to allow a better viewing angle for someone looking over your shoulder. Thirdly, the action on the rotation pivot is not very smooth and lacks a positive stop at 90 degrees. All these can be summed up by saying the monitor stand is not as nice as Dell's.\\n\\nI would have preferred the monitor not use an outboard DC transformer (another point in Dell's favour). I am concerned about energy consumption in sleep mode, as the transformer always feels a little warm. The cord that plugs into the monitor is so short that it leaves the transformer dangling over the floor when the monitor is in portrait position. I needed to use something to support the transformer to relieve the strain on the DC plug.\\n\\nNot much is needed to be said about the display quality. It is simply stunning. Everything is sharp & clear. With this new gorgeous large screen, I am almost looking forward to doing my tax return this year.","[]","B01F3H4JGK","B01F3H4JGK","AH3C2WO4ZEV7Q6WYFSSZIPE7HQOA","2017-02-05 20:36:15.000","6","True","505"
"866426","1","Nice Unit & Low-Cost, But Faulty Ground Light Indicator","[[VIDEOID:234b6e656824e3a78d9545a3a7366a11]] I purchased five APC PE76W (white) and PE76 (black) 7-outlet surge protectors to replace old ones that I no longer trusted. (I have seen recommendations to replace them every year or two.) There is a lot I like about the PE76 and PE76W. The extended/offset plug at the end allows for a good-sized power brick (aka wall wart) to be plugged in without obstructing the other outlets. The flat, 90-degree plug allows the unit to be plugged in behind bookcases and tall drawers. The cord is long and appears to be high quality.\\n\\nThe issue I have with these is that on all five of them, the ground light began to flicker or just go out completely. (I have uploaded a video showing what the issue is.) Some started doing this fairly quickly; others took a month or two to start having the issue. I have tested the circuit with a circuit tester (both in the wall and in the surge protector), and the circuit is fine. These units have a lifetime warranty, but I don't think getting a replacement would help nor do I think there is an issue worth pursuing. To be fair, I have had one other surge protector with flickering LEDs, and it was not an APC brand. That was a while ago, and most have not had the ground light start to flicker or go out, so I believe this is a manufacturing issue. Personally, I'm not worried about the ground, but I could see where it might worry others.\\n\\n** Update on 10/11/2017 **\\nOn the unit I happened to use in the video below, the protection LED is now intermittent as well. Since surge protectors don't &quot;heal&quot; themselves, it's obviously just an issue with the light and not the power protection. The thing is, I can't trust that to always be the case, so I threw it out and replaced it with [[ASIN:B0000AI0N2 Tripp Lite 10 Outlet Surge Protector Power Strip Tel/Modem 8ft Cord 2395 Joules (TLP1008TEL)]]. I liked the old one's smaller size, but what good is it if I can't rely on it?","[]","B01M8LCREB","B09T2X5YCL","AFARATE3LK3TSW7T334GPYR7J55Q","2017-10-06 12:20:33.225","259","True","505"
"910021","1","Updated: Expensive basic alarm clock, maybe useful if you use the music app... maybe","updated after 2 years: I updated my review earlier but looks like it didn't take. iHome is garbage, you can;'t set the alarms for this device from an iPhone.  I noticed that someone from the company said I should contact them in the comments so looked again.  Straight from the web site:\\n\\n""The iPL24 is not compatible with any iHome Apps. The alarm needs to be set manually. For operational assistance please contact our Support Team at 1-800-288-2792 Mon - Fri from 8am - 4pm EST.""\\n\\nSo, you can set the alarm manually, you can indeed play music from the dock, but you can't use this junk for what people buy it for, waking up with music off your iPhone.  Probably can get it to work if you have something queued up every night before you go to bed, but that's not how people use alarms with repeatable alarms.\\n\\nJunk, stay away from this company,\\n\\nI haven't decided if I'll keep this.  My first priority was to have a dock to charge my phone next to my bed, works fine for that.  But waking up to the music has been really loosely (maybe not) tested.  I use Google Play Music, so I typically don't have apple music open on my phone.  The problem is that this only works with apple music, so if it's not already open with a song your recently played it opens a random song for the alarm.  Maybe not what you'd want to wake up to in the morning.  So I need to play a song on iPhone Music AND leave the app open to wake up to a specific song.\\n\\nUse the app?  Nope, it doesn't even give you an option to pick iPhone, it's iPod or buzzer, pick iPod right?  Nope again, that crashes the app, at least on my iPhone 7.  I know, I'll leave the music app open and then try to select it via the app... nope, still crashes.\\n\\nI think it's an expensive alarm clock and doesn't really work for iPhones.  I will say it works with my case, so that's a pro.  I might go look for the box in the garage, if I still have it I'm thinking it goes back","[]","B01F459K7O","B01F459K7O","AFBTHWSR76TA2J7F5UHNSTTLAZAQ","2017-01-01 01:25:09.000","8","True","505"
"810070","5","Incredibly detailed, warm sound, but...","UPDATE 2:  I was sitting at dinner tonight and was suddenly aware of what a magnificent recording I was listing to.  Perfectly recorded bass, piano, drums, each identifiable separately and sounding like a perfect live recording.  Then I realized, really what I am impressed with is this speaker.  Ignore the app.  Right now I have it connected directly to an Amazon echo dot (stereo output) and am listening to jazz on Pandora, and it sounds amazing.  You don't need the stupid Klipsch app.  There are many other ways to use this, and you should, because it really is a well designed speaker system.\\nUPDATE: The Stream Play app borders on useless.  While it seemed to work at first, it has slowly degenerated to the point where it will endlessly attempt to find the speaker, or find a station on Pandora, etc., which results in having to restart the phone to get it to stop.  Have given up using the app.  Right now I'm using bluetooth on my phone and the Pandora app, but even the ability to connect via bluetooth seems spotty.  It's too bad because it is a really nice speaker.  If you use a line in, it works perfectly, but you can't go to the next song.  Two stars off.\\n\\nORIGINAL REVIEW:  First off, the cabinet is beautiful.  Very classy, and fits perfectly with our mid-century modern house.  I had Pandora playing via Bluetooth from my tablet thru this speaker in under 5 minutes.  Pairing was quick and easy.  I was surprised to find I could use the Klipsch remote to go to the next song over Bluetooth.  Setting up the Klipsch Stream Play took slightly longer, but had that going within 10 minutes.  The Stream Play app is more designed for multiple speaker use (switching between rooms, adding speakers to music already playing, etc).\\n\\nThe sound is surprisingly good.  Very detailed, warm sound.  Even at moderate volumes, piano dynamics with excellent, saxophone sounded clear but not harsh, to the point you could hear the breath of the player.  Bass response is right on the money with this unit, tight and extending further than you'd expect, but not overpowering.  This is, without a doubt, the nicest table top speaker system I've ever heard.  Highly recommended.","[]","B01M34LRMI","B01M34LRMI","AG7ZPB5T4ZGBEJXMUSVYO3B3WCPA","2017-06-05 21:54:28.000","3","False","505"

The first tablet I bought was the Fire HD10 and I followed the directions according to the graphics given.  The card EASILY slid into the slot with no problem.  After all, the directions told me to do it this way, with the notches on the card pointing downward.\\n\\nThen I bought the Fire HD 8 (7th Generation).  I inserted the card the same way as I did with my Fire HD10, the way the directions told me to.  It DID NOT WORK!!!! I could not for the life of me get the card to spring into the slot.  I tried about 3 x's when I thought, turn the card upside-down.  Even though the directions tell me the notches should be facing down and the label should be facing towards me, I decided to turn it.  VOILA!!! The card sprung into the slot!! The directions are NOT CORRECT for the HD8!!! You need to havethe notches facing up.\\n\\nFor both tablets, there is a slight spring-like action when inserting the card.  For removal, you should push in the card slightly with your fingernail and it should spring out enough for you to pull it out.\\n\\nThis card works very well with the fire tablet.  At first, I thought any micro SD card would work but the others seem to lag when retrieving from the card.  I have no problems with lagging on this one.  It works just like the internal memory.  I have my music stored on this card and the songs play smoothly.  If you have a Fire tablet, get this one which is made for it!\\n\\nJust remember, insertion of the card depends on your Fire tablet!!!\\n\\nI bought this for the Fire HD10.  I had my music from my CDs stored on my computer and transferred them onto this with a memory card reader.  I suggest you get at least an adapter to change it into an SD card to use with your computer OR a memory card reader which takes many forms of cards, those are the best.  It makes it easier and faster to transfer files, erase files, or to format.\\n\\nI have had no problems with it so far with the Fire tablet or my computer.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611nIYCAIOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611nIYCAIOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611nIYCAIOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619nWQGRygL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619nWQGRygL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619nWQGRygL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B013TMNKAW","B08KZ1TZYB","AHKOLKDU7GYY3Y4HPOPOBW6FDZAQ","2017-10-30 20:33:04.885","555","True","505"

For $10 more you can by a brand new drive from WD, those $10 for him pretty much kept him in budget for what he wanted to spend on the whole build, but boy were we wrong to go the refurbished route....Now I'm sure we just got a bad egg, I don't want to believe that ALL refurbished products are bad, because they're not, sometimes refurbished items are really really good! but this wasn't one of those times....As soon as I tried installing a fresh copy of Win 10 off USB the system crashed.....Ok no big deal, let's just start over, finally (after 5 tries) get to an installation screen, and go to wipe the drive, aaaaaaand crash. OK ok, lets try again....into an infinite boot screen....Now at this point I was getting nowhere trying to boot from it so I swapped it into my personal rig to try to diagnose the issue. Which didn't work because it crashed my entire system to the point of the Windows Recovery Tool not being able to even repair and get to my desktop.\\n\\nFOR 8 HOURS I tried getting this thing to work, finally I was able to get my personal rig going and set this drive up as a hot swap drive in BIOS so that I could investigate after I could get into my desktop.

It sucks that this was my experience with a refurbished HDD, especially since I exclusively use WD drives as my storage drives.\\n\\nANOTHER THING TO NOTE: After some investigation this seems to be a fairly common issue with WD Green drives new or not, nonetheless I still feel I was dealt a bad egg.","[]","B01G4LLSYA","B01G4LLSYA","AFZFJXG2O4X657ZQXJS7NETCBOMA","2017-02-05 08:15:46.000","4","True","505"
"76215","4","Netgear has nice HD securtity cam!","Arlo Pro camera was a great add on to my Existing Arlo setup. The Arlo pro worked with the old base station but some options are limited such as sounding an alarm this does not work as original base station has no alarm.\\nPros: Cost. at around $180 at time of this post it is $70 to $20 less then competitors like Nest($249) and Ring ($199.99). The arlo pro was easy to setup, can be used wired or Wire-free, has 130 degree field of view over the 110 field of view of original Arlo, weatherproof, HD quality (720p), has rechargeable battery, 2 way audio (built in mic and speaker), better motion detection then original Arlo, night vision, 7 day FREE cloud storage.\\nCons: It would be nice to have 1080p HD quality but to save on battery life Netgear opted for 720p. No 5GHz option wireless is limited to the already crowded 2.4GHz band. The base station is required to setup and use Arlo. so this adds another piece of hardware to your modem/router/etc can take up space and power outlets. The rechargeable battery is not standard size battery. So while it is great not to need to buy batteries over and over or buy your own rechargeable batteries like with original Arlo. Since the battery is not standard you will have to take down camera once battery is low to recharge or have the option to spend $50 and get a second battery and $60 for the charging station adding $110 in additional cost. The mic on Arlo pro is amazing at catching the smallest sound detail but the speaker, if camera is setup outside, is next to impossible to hear.\\nOverall:  Arlo pro is step up from Arlo and it does what it is designed to do which is mount the camera ( using wireless option) in many places you cannot get a wired camera and it provide clear HD quality videos and audio to monitor an area. If you do not mount in high traffic area battery should last about 6 months before charge is needed ( per Netgear) so if you can get past the inconvenience of having to take down camera to recharge battery or buy charge station/extra battery then the Arlo pro is a great option for you.  Having both Ring Doorbell and Ring Stickup can I can say Arlo Pro does give Ring competition as video does tend to be clearer on Arlo.","[]","B01MDIYVI9","B08739SDH3","AETJNZN24QO76F5MGXO5MO4UIIKA","2017-03-09 15:12:56.000","4","True","505"
"338481","2","Great design but a let down on gestures and connectivity","I have to admit I am a fan of Apple products usually, but this is one of the rare exceptions where I am genuinely not happy with the quality of the product. I have not purchased these from Amazon but from a different store, but I feel my input may help some other buyers.\\nPros:\\nWell made, portable, light weight. I like the battery case too, it feels very premium and houses the EarPods quite well. I also liked that I can see the Battery level of the case and the EarPods on my iPhone. The pairing process was indeed as simple as advertised, both with my iPhone and my 2016 MacBook pro touch bar. The sound quality is not much different than the standard EarPods, but I am not complaining\\nCons:\\nI will state the obvious flaws letter below, but the main issue that I experience with my iPhone 6 was the limited functionality and lack of much control. The double tap only lets you choose between Siri or Play pause. It would have been great to have left tap for Siri, right for play/pause or some kind of volume control gesture. Second, the whole double tap detection itself was very flaky, based on my usage for around 2 days, the earphones just failed to detect double taps 80% of the time, often I had to go to my phone screen and pause a song or start it. The other issue I had was I experience momentary disconnects while music was playing even though the phone was in my pocket when I either put my hand on the back of the phone or moved my head in a certain way. These disconnects were not very frequent but they did happen.\\nAnd now the obvious flaw that everyone mentions, the possibility of losing them. I considered getting a lanyard, but given the way these recharge, it will be impractical to remove and re-attach the lanyard every time I have to put these in their case.\\n\\nIn short I am not impressed with this product, its an excellent idea and I love their product design as always. But the product seems unfinished, especially the bluetooth and gesture recognition. Hopefully this is something they can fix over software patches. But for now I think I will be returning mine as I did not feel the price was worth the overall usability of this product.\\nFeel free to comment if you have had a different experience or if you feel I may have got a defective piece","[]","B01MQWUXZS","B01MQWUXZS","AENHOISPHOKKCDFMBY3H2R24C7DA","2017-03-31 02:47:36.000","4","False","505"

The store is limited. Highly limited. Unless Amazon have partnered in some way, it's likely your favorite games/apps for your kids won't be on there.\\n  - YouTube Kids is NOT available because Google own it. There's a couple pretend YTKids apps there and they are rubbish. This is a deal breaker for us.\\n  - Settings - When you set up your child's profile, you input your child's age and supposedly the store will only show age-related options. Except, after setting the age limitation on the tablet at age 8, my son was shown the Washington Post app, among others which are simply inappropriate.\\n  - Scrolling through looking for apps is a monumental pain in the rear. There's not a way to search from within the kid's profile, instead you have to scroll endlessly, hoping you stumble upon what you were looking for.\\n  - As a parent, i don't want apps being shown to my child unless I approve them. Too many (see above) apps are visible that I don't want him to see. There's also no way to see an app's home screen to explain what the app is. If you tap on an app, it automatically installs it. Again, oh heck no!\\n  - Given the limited apps on Freetime, we installed Google Play store. Our hope was to bypass Freetime completely and just use the OS to run Kids Play (well loved parental control app on android). Unfortunately, Amazon have specifically kneecapped Kids Play outside of Freetime. So in essence, even if you have other alternatives, you can't use THIS device to utilize your options. You are forced to use FreeTime.\\n\\nOverall, we wanted to love this device but the limited apps and lack of thoughtful parental controls (seriously, do any of the devs not have kids??) resulted that we returned this a few days after trying it out.","[]","B01J94SBMQ","B01J94SBMQ","AEC63XT7JU4JID554TEEH6V3VYNA","2017-10-07 19:44:43.242","159","True","505"
"964386","3","Awesome image quality. Horrible ergonomics and usability","CAVEAT!!!\\n5 Stars as a lens for my OSMO X5 pro stabilized camera.\\n2.5 Stars as a lens for my GH4\\n\\nSo, I got this as a &#34;normal&#34; lens for the OSMO X5. I wanted something close to a 50mm depth-of-field to complement my other Zuiko 25mm lens' wider dop (not referring to the crop on the X5's M43 body which is a different thing entirely).  They're incredibly small and work really well with the lightweight Osmo gimbal.  I focus with the DJ I follow focus control wheel. The system is incredibly responsive and focuses really well.  So, I thought that if I'm traveling with a very small footprint and want to use this lens shooting either video or photography with my GH4 it should also work well.  My experience is bittersweet at best.\\n\\nRegarding image quality of this, and other Zuiko M43 lenses,  all I can say is fantastic.  The sharpness even wide open his tack sharp. The 9 blade iris creates beautiful, circular bokeh.  I even think that flaring is quite pleasant with this lens. Overall, I couldn't expect more, especially at this price point.\\nMy big gripe is with the focus ring. I rarely, if ever use auto focus. My primary workflow, in fact, is not M43 lenses. I work with both old and new Zeiss primes fitted for full-frame EOS systems that I adapt with a Metabones speed booster.  Gripping the barrel of those lenses yields responsive focus pulls that I can dial-in instantly. I found that focusing this lens specifically was quite sloppy. I would have to crank 2-3 times the circumference of the barrel in order to focus and most often, overshoot the focus then quickly reverse and under shoot until I dial it in. It took several more seconds than I was used to and missed shots completely. It's not intuitive or user-friendly at all. Also, the amount of cranking creates a shaky wobble  when trying to rack focus in video.\\nAll in all, if you plan on using this as a manual lens for anything other than landscape, I'd consider it as a last resort. A shame considering the actual image quality of the lens is pretty stellar.","[]","B0058G40O8","B06ZYSLP64","AGJJQ4PG6J5ZXX6NOJ2UNQNI6SSQ","2017-02-10 02:46:10.000","0","True","505"
"452071","4","Good LED light but missing polarity information on DC 9V input","Quite a nice LED light, versatile and effective. This LED light puts out a lot of lumens. I don't recall right now what the rated lumens is but its quite a bit. The on-off switch is not simply a toggle but a dimmer as well. Turning it on at first produces a low intensity light but as the dial is turned to full capacity the light also brightens to maximum.\\n\\nThe device has multiple power methods, AA batteries is one. It has an adapter for another type of battery, which I am not sure what type that is. It also has an outlet for 9V DC input but one drawback is that a AC/DC 9V adapter was NOT included.\\n\\nAC/DC 9V adapters are inexpensive and readily available, but another drawback is that the 9V DC input receptacle on this LED light is not marked with the polarity. 9V DC receptacles are very common in electrical devices. They are circular with a center metal rod. The 9V DC cord is also circular with a metal sleeve and a hole in the center where the metal rod of the receptacle fits. See attached for a picture of a generic AC/DC 9V adapter.\\nUnfortunately, there are two industry standards for AC/DC 9V adapters.\\n1) One standard is that the center pole is positive\\n2) The other standard is that the center pole is negative.\\nTypically devices that have an receptacle for a DC 9V adapter have a diagram next to it to indicate which polarity is being used.\\nAnd the problem with the McoPlus LED light is that there is no polarity diagram next to it.\\nI emailed Mcoplus about this and asked what the polarity is but they never responded.\\nSo I asked my electrical engineer neighbor to test it, which he did and reported to me that it is center pole positive.\\n\\nAttached are pictures of a generic AC/DC 9V adapter and both the positive and negative industry-standard diagrams, which this Mcoplus lacks. If you purchase this LED light, hopefully the manufacturer has added the needed polarity diagram but if they have not, I would suggest you get it tested and not assume that they are all center-pole-positive like the one I have. Of course this is an issue only if you want to use DC 9V as the power source.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/01k6Aw56JYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/01k6Aw56JYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/01k6Aw56JYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/01k6Aw56JYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/01k6Aw56JYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/01k6Aw56JYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31se+iTbbqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31se+iTbbqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31se+iTbbqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00ORGKG1Q","B00ORGKG1Q","AEESY6UJTO7L3UMU2AT2OSZYXUFQ","2017-11-04 00:00:56.179","0","True","505"
"894946","5","Wow.  Get it.","So far it's perfect.  Super easy set up.  Pretty much plug in and it walks you thru a simple on screen menu.  It already knew I had an amazon prime account and also an Amazon Alexa.  So it locked in and works perfect.  The voice control on the remote is brilliant and works.  No more hunting for things.  Just say what you want it it pops up on screen.  Having the amazon music library is also great.  You do need to plug in the &#34;stick&#34; but same on Roku.  I have a nice AVR and home theater set up so I actually plugged the stick into the AVR,  not the TV.  This way I get the high quality dolby digital audio thru my receiver and all my different sources are switched thru the AVR.  So then you don't have to change sources on the TV since the AVR is your master switcher.  Works perfect.  Amazon Prime Video is the default window so all the amazon shows come up on the home screen but once you start watching Netflix it populates with your shows too.  So it is great that Amazon did not &#34;blacklist&#34; Netflix.  Seems like it is designed to make whatever you watch on whatever platform easy to get to .  Used to use my Sony BluRay player to watch netflix and amazon shows but it was really flakey and took forever for Amazon shows to get to HD. They would start out very fuzzy and low rez and take about 60 seconds to increase in quality to HD.  Part of that is my having slow internet speeds in my home ( thank you ATT Uverse), but the new Fire TV stick is much faster in its processing speed which is what I hoped for and why I got it.  I have also used the new Roku stick,  and while it works well if you are  an AMAZON user this is for sure a way better solution.  And the voice command thing is great.  You do have to press and hold the button down on the remote for the voice command since it is not always &#34;listening&#34; like Alexa is,  but I don't mind that at all. With so many choices, scrolling thru tons of menus and screens is so 2016!  So faster processing,  better interface. Voice commands that work... Means just get it.","[]","B00ZV9RDKK","B075X8471B","AGAW3TZBKNKPH5BUXSBBZYS6KYJQ","2017-01-28 18:49:49.000","1","True","505"
"701758","5","This device is a 5-star device, and every area it meets or exceeds expectations. Don't get hung up on the little things","An excellent device built with foresight into the future of the Chromebook world. A lot of people will complain about the building materials not being sturdy and the item being flexible I have found this item to be extremely sturdy and well-designed. There is always a trade-off when you want a lighter device lighter components must be used there is a small Flex to the device but it's nothing to write home about. I use it every day all day for research and study and fun and have yet to run into any issues. I am not a light user by any means and this has met all of my expectations. It would have been great to have a normal USB port so I didn't have to have an adapter with me at all times I understand that moving forward that is the new technology but we still should strive to me people where they're at not where they're going to be that would be my only complaint other than that it's a fantastic device. I have both this and the Asus Chromebook flip c302ca and it works beautifully with the heavier tasks and it is somewhat faster. But the 3 by 2 aspect ratio on this device won me over. And the world of accessories this Falls flat on its face though it's incredibly difficult to find accessories for this that actually is functional. I have yet to find a keyboard cover for it and have been searching for a long time. The S Pen does not just sit in the device not being used, I thought it was Goofy at first well I was definitely wrong it's both intuitive and Incredibly convenient when doing any sort of research. It's priced right and it offers the speed looks convenience and Power of Ultrabooks that cost twice this much. Keep in mind that you're not going to get$1,200 Chromebook for $550 but for $550 you'll get a Chromebook that performs nearly as well as one. And don't listen to all the whiners about not having a backlit keyboard, using a keyboard has been commonplace for three decades if you can't type without looking at the keyboard then you don't even need to be on a computer. In addition to that, the screen is so dang bright you can type on a computer across the room that doesn't have a backlit keyboard. The smaller keyboard layout does take the period of acclimation but it's nothing to whine over. Samsung did a great job, everything could always use Improvement but I find myself very happy with this device and I'm sure you will too.","[]","B071LB1GG4","B071LB1GG4","AEIQDB7RFOTZDORUNFAG56J6TJCA","2017-10-08 22:27:26.788","13","True","505"
"503173","4","Great Wifi Mesh for the everyday user","I've had the Milo Wifi System for about a month now.  The setup was simple and fast, although I had some problems initially but they turned out to be with my existing router/AP (Note - Milo support was excellent!).  It is working very well and is very stable so far.  I haven't had to restart it, or my router once since the install and final placement of the units.  My devices stay connected and I get consistent and adequate speed to each of them.  Occasionally, there is slight lag on mobile devices as you move through the house, which I'm sure is due to switching connections between the &#34;Base&#34; and &#34;Point&#34;.  The overall coverage/range is good.  My environment consists of the following...\\n\\n2500sqft 2 story house\\n50 meg AT&T connection through their standard router/AP\\n2 node Milo Wifi\\n4 laptops\\n3 ipads\\n6 phones\\n2 ps3\\n4 video streaming devices\\n2 wireless printers\\n\\nRoughly 70-80% of the devices listed are connected at the same time.  I can stream video to 2 TVs, have 2 kids on Netflix, myself working on my laptop and have other family playing games on their ipads without any complaints or issues.  I might be able to do more, but that's what I have tested so far.  The speed seems to be consistent between the devices in the speed tests I've done throughout my house.  Overall, very happy with the product.  I gave it 4/5 stars only because of the following....\\n\\n- limited feature set (no QOS, etc..)\\n- Base and point should be a little closer than spec'd by Milo (Max 30ft apart in my opinion)\\n- no web interface, must be installed through mobile app\\n- range is pretty good, but would like a little more speed at the farther ends of the range\\n\\nIf you are looking for an inexpensive whole home Wifi mesh, Milo is a great choice for the average everyday user.  I like the way it extends your existing SSID wirelessly without the need to connect it directly to your router with a cable and the setup is very simple.","[]","B0752TSPZD","B0752TSPZD","AHF25ZYDO4Z5FTKGFTMTNWNKEGJQ","2017-11-27 17:58:34.694","14","True","505"

I'm an engineer, not a professional graphics card reviewer (go on youtube and watch comparisons), but I did research and monitor the release of the 1080, 1070, 1060 and 1050.  This card will get you up and running with all the latest games (and probably last 2+ years if all you want is 1080p) and running excessive FPS's (ie. well above 60fps) at 1080p res, and max ultra settings with exception to advanced shadow type settings in games like GTA5 and Watch Dogs2.  Doom is silky smooth (mine ran at 130fps or something like that), without any stutter ever.  It should be able run some games at 1440p at roughly 50fps from my research, but the frame rate starts coming down and it will bounce off 30 fps or lower.  Recommend the 1060 if you are completely fine with 1080p gaming. However if you need to play on 2k or 4k, I recommend going with 1070 or 1080 (or as of April 17, just waiting until the next iteration of GeForce releases).  A bonus for me was this card is silent - I have this card running its stock OC profile - and the fans never turn on during gaming!  Because I have ridiculously great performance, I haven't even bothered trying to push it further at the cost of tweaking time and silence.  Great value card for me too - I finally received the rebate 4 months later, so the card truly only cost me $235 plus tax.\\n\\nMy wife and I had Prime at the time, but the delivery was botched - took about 14 days to receive this card (about a $600 computer parts order total from Amazon themselves) all of which was indeed in stock. The order wasn't even filled until a day or so after the fact - and the order status did not change accurately.  We cancelled Prime and received a refund because of this and two other extended delivery problems (and no I don't live in a far-away rural town).  I've really gone back to brick and mortar stores; there really is minimal savings if any when buying from Amazon, there is no savings on taxes,- I only get things from Amazon I don't mind waiting a week or more time delivery, and also only Kindle purchases.","[]","B01IEKYD5U","B073CTNHTH","AGQ7ROIHH5Y6VB7UOSOUEFIM3FAA","2017-04-01 20:02:15.000","0","False","505"

I originally bought this for attaching to the brain of my back packing pack holding my Canon 60D and it fits perfectly in the bungee chords on the top. This is a lot of product for the money. It is extremely well padded, has a &#34;U&#34; shaped Velcro divider inside to hold your camera up, two decently usable side pockets. One holds the INCLUDED rain cover (awesome!) and I have my cameras battery charger in the other. it actually fits and the zipper closes comfortably. Speaking of zippers they all feel sturdy and well  made. They also zip very smoothly. They don't catch or get stuck. I don't think you will get any split zippers on the case. It also has a back pocket that i keep memory cards in. You could also keep a Field Notes note pad  and a pen or mechanical Pencil in it if you wanted. The back side has a very well padded mesh and doesn't get hot or sweaty. The bottom unzips and extends which is cool because I can fit my 60d with a 18-135mm lens and the 40mm and 24 mm pancake lenses as well. I can also fit my Nikon D700 no grip with my 18-35mm f3.5-5.6 lens with my 50mm f1.8d lens very comfortable. I tried my D700 with the Nikon 70-200mm f2.8 vr2 because it claims it can handle 70-200mm lenses, Buuuuuuut while it can handle the weight of the combo just fine it doesn't fit that well. You have to remove the tripod foot, remove lens hood, and it is really difficult to zip the case closed with that lens. So it won't really fit that lens iffin you have one. It does come with a microfiber cloth for cleaning your lenses so that's the beeze kneeze. The only real gripe i have with this case is the attachment points for the sling. They are made out of what feels like light weight plastic and the clamps too. if they ever break you could just buy a couple of decent carabiners and attach the strap back with those. More reliable that way. The strap it's self is decent and has a nice shoulder pad that won't slide around on you. Over all this is a great case and you should pick it if you are seriously looking for one.","[]","B00IDYS0XY","B00IDYS0XY","AF4KI5JAR5DKWDCT5NCQPQHUZWVA","2017-07-03 05:40:34.662","2","True","505"

I REALLLLLY want to give this 5 stars, but I as an engineer and a quality control expert, I just cannot.  SO, first, the GOOD (and there is A LOT of GOOD).\\n\\n1. Excellent control and power in a small size for my outdoor Bose 101 (4 ohm) speakers.  Plenty of power and good manual adjustment for treble and bass.\\n2. The Bluetooth is amazing ... I ran this for about 4 hours nonstop and zero cutouts and the iphone 7plus was about 60 feet away and NOT in a light of sight ... simply put, pretty awesome range!\\n3. Size and capabilities ... plenty of input and output options, the volume dial is solid and responsive and the compact size makes it easy to put just about anywhere, and the remote included is very responsive and allows control of your phone without it even having to be insight, bonus for our outdoor enjoyment!!\\n\\nOk .. now the ONE bad thing ... the first one I ordered, had a power supply that was DOA!!!  NOOOO!  I was so bummed.  As I am an engineer, I have a work bench to test this type of stuff, and immediately saw that the power supply, though the little green light was lit, wasn't putting out any usable power.  It made me even more mad that someone actually put their &#34;QC&#34; sticker on the power supply, which, yeah yeah, I know this was made in China ... but still ... putting that sticker on there and not testing it goes against 25 years of my life!  LOL.\\n\\nNow that I have complained about that ... I will say that Amazon almost IMMEDIATELY replaced my unit with a new on that worked right out of the box.  I reported it on Saturday afternoon and was hand-delivered the replacement by an Amazon delivery person Monday morning.  Unfortunately, I still do have to ship the broken one (mind you, the unit worked, just not the external power supply) by dropping it off at UPS.

In short, as others have said, the directions are very vague.\\nThe key step here, is very hard to figure out:  &#34;Note ID 7:  The control wire is located in the steering wheel column in a White or Gray plug.

Way better!\\n\\n[[ASIN:B00B4PJC9K Metra Axxess ASWC-1 Universal Steering Wheel Control Interface]]\\n\\nYou do not have to cut any wires, just use the little white bus wire that came off the back of the factory radio, stick the pink wire in the hole, black tape it off so you can keep that connector in case you ever need to take it back to stock. Connect the black wire to ground, the red wire to power, tape off everything else, done, and dreams come true.\\nAlso I CAN control phone volume with the Metra Axxess on my pioneer AVH-3300NEX\\nI understand you can reprogram the buttons as well with the Metra, which I know you can't do with the PAC.  I have not tired yet however.\\n\\nSo, no big slam on PAC maybe its great for other cars, i just rather pay $13 more and do it the easy way instead of taking apart my steering wheel and guessing which wire to cut on my WJ.

However, immersive listening should be done with the &#34;old-school&#34; cable anyways, so I'll be talking about this product as it is meant to be used as: a casual, wireless listening experience.\\n\\nOverall I think its quality is pretty stellar, IF you use similarly priced earphones. It's a good way to pamper your in-ear collections such as the Shure SE215, MEE audio M7 Pro, Westone W10, or Fiio F9 (or F9 Pro). All excellent and well acclaimed monitors, that are under the $200 price-range. These tend to pair well with the Bluetooth cables for casual listening. One thing to note is that the MMCX connectors are a little tight, often making it difficult to detach from your favorite earbuds. Though this may be a good thing too when it's just hanging from your neck.\\n\\nThey definitely don't fair well when you use them with the W60s, or other similarly speced earbuds, but I use them with my Fiio F9 Pro - an excellent pair of in-ear hybrid monitors. I've noticed sound quality is reduced ever-so-slightly, but this is expected. On the go, it's the best way to cut the cord, while still enjoying the quality it manages to translate.\\n\\nI'm not sure whether I'd spend $100 on a product like this, but objectively speaking, it's not bad. I like it. I own the W60s, and it came bundled with this Bluetooth Cable.

"460562","2","too many problems not good","So this is my 2nd kindle. I got one before 2-3 years ago on my Birthday. The screen for it recently shattered and so I decided to get a new one. I loved my last kindle even with its little problems. I think the last one was 8in about and 16GB (Kindle Fire). This one has given me so many problems. When I first got it I noticed a few blind spots in the touch screen when I type certain letters (2 letters). I thought no big deal I dont really need to type that much I will mostly read and scroll, with time though more blind spots came up and so it made it a hassle using it (idk how many there are now, even flipping the screen does not help since it all over the place).My little neice cant even play games because she cant understand\\n why the touchscreen does not work very well. Additionally the kindle is very slow, I dont feel like it was like this when I first got it but even switching apps takes time now. I do not know if this is because I got a 8gb and that makes for slow computing power or what. I can not even use all the same apps from my last kindle on this one. They just dont appear in my library. This it where it gets most frustrating. So at least I want to read my books on the kindle, which is one of the biggest things I do. I cant get my old epub reader on this kindle and when I go to download a epub reader there is a limited selection which is different from my last kindles and all these apps suck. I downloaded over 7 readers I think before I found one that works. Some would not work, others required library card, or could not get access to my onedrive to download my books from there..in the end the one that worked was bookshelf but I needed to create an account to use it. It was a big hassle.\\nI use to access my kindle every single day on my old one, this one I hardly touch. If you ever see a problem with your kindle just send it back right away because it might have more in the future. Also 8gb might be too small because of processing power and so slow down your kindle. I dont like what I saw in there app store this time around but its hard to comment if its overall good or bad since I dont use it much.","[]","B018Y229OU","B010BWYDYA","AFU7ZMJYNNRIWHHG7BKXIWU2YYCA","2017-08-11 17:49:48.415","1","True","504"
"669360","4","Great hardware. Operating system and apps leave much to be desired.","This is a difficult review to write because so much depends on how you are going to use the device. For the price ($50 as I write this) it is a fantastic buy. Nicely made, good screen, reasonable performance (but not for heavy-duty gamers), plenty of storage, space for an SD card, lasts a long time on a single charge, etc. The battery can be replaced by the user, although the process takes a bit of care. That will save a lot of money in the long run. There are a few things I don't like about the HD8 that have to do with the software. First, the operating system is Amazon's version of Android, which is very limited compared with standard Android. For example, the only apps you can get are out of the Amazon App Store, which has nowhere near the selection of Google Play. Fortunately, there is a way to get Google Play to work on the HD8. Look it up and you will find the instructions. Second the launcher interface is not customisable. Again, there is a workaround devised by some very smart people on the XDA-Developers forum. If you follow their instructions, you can install Nova or any other Android Launcher. The keyboard that comes with the HD8 is OK, but nowhere near the quality of Swype or SwiftKey. Fortunately, if you installed Google Play you can get these keyboards. The final thing that I find annoying is that Amazon assumes that you want to buy movies and books from them and are constantly throwing up ads for these items without being asked for them. If you don't want to be bothered by these ads, you need to disable the apps that control them. You have to do a bit of searching to find out how to do that. For me, I do my movie watching on a big screen TV and read eBooks on a Paperwhite. But if you plan to use your tablet as an e-reader or to watch movies, you might like these apps. After Installing Google Play and downloading my favorite apps, installing the Nova Launcher and the Swiftkey keyboard and disabling all the ad apps, I have a very satisfactory 8&#34; tablet. I should mention Alexa which is included with the HD8. I already own an Echo which got heavy use for 2 days and hasn't been used since. But you might love it. The only thing missing is an IR radiator so that I could use the tablet for controlling my home entertainment system.","[]","B01J94SWWU","B01J94SWWU","AGZFEPCWGLTON7YZNRXXL24KMKMQ","2017-12-22 23:17:03.985","1","True","504"
"909363","5","Drive enclosures that work, but read the review.","I have used other Rosewill products and found them to be well made and functional.  I ordered 3 of these drive enclosures to hold 3 WD Black 1 TB mobile hard disk drives.  While the enclosures are made of plastic, the top has a sheet of what appears to be anodized aluminum (black).  The drives fit well in the enclosures and work well in doing exactly what they were designed to do, function as an outboard hard drive.  Others have mentioned the attached USB &#34;pigtail&#34; the enclosures are made with are very short, but they are perfectly usable if you have a small desktop on a flat surface or a laptop, which makes it easy to reach the ports.  What was unexpected was when the drives are plugged in and in use, my wireless Logitech mouse is susceptible to some kind of interference that comes through the plastic case of the drive enclosures.  The mouse returns to normal as soon as the drives are disconnected.  I don't know if the blame should be on the electric design of the Logitech wireless system or the design of the WD hard drive or the circuit board in the drive enclosures or their plastic sides.  I can say this:  Months ago I bought a 1 TB HGST 2.5&#34; mobile hard drive.  It was built with an all aluminum enclosure.  It has never caused any problems with my wireless mouse.\\n\\nSo the Rosewill 2.5&#34; enclosures work as advertised, and they do make for a nice looking portable drive at a very reasonable cost.  I can recommend them from those two points.  As to whether they will continue to work for the long term (they do include a necessary circuit board and a USB pigtail) I will need to wait and see.  The last situation concerning the interference problems with my wireless mouse leaves me without knowing what to recommend.  All I can say is I've used the Logitech for many years, with many different computers, pieces of equipment and other drives all around it and have never experienced this problem before.  The enclosures may very well not be to blame, but since it is possible to buy drive enclosures that are all metal, the next time I will most likely go that route.  In the mean time I will use the Rosewill enclosures with USB extension cables to get as much distance from my mouse as possible.","[]","B00N1Q2KSU","B00N1Q2KSU","AFOWHOG3GLMBU5IF45DTKDL3UVZQ","2017-11-06 02:39:43.392","2","True","504"
"624274","4","Decent, for the money","Full disclosure, I'm a musician and have been a sandman, and worked for a symphony and played in rock bands so I tend to know audio, this said am not an over-the-top audiophile type. Are these's a musician's musician music first choice in headphones, not hardly. Do these have great replication of music? Ha no, in fact, these are not great, not great at all. VERY muddy throughout most the sound band. Love bass? These probably won't do it. Love highs? May disappoint. Mid-range? Well that's pretty muddy, in fact these reproduce audio so everything seems muddy, almost as if things are muffled by 5% and nothing stands out in the notes or music in any extraordinary way.\\n\\nSo what gives? Why four stars? At the price-point I purchased these, $35, for what I needed them for emergency last minute about to board a plane, they did a fairly decent job of blocking out plane noise and I could, in fact, hear the music. In fact then in a cafe or a noisy house with kids it muffled the background sounds vaguely okay, better than others I've had for three ties the cost (JVCs, which weren't great). If you don't care so much what music sounds like, technically, like you're not that big a fan of hearing every facet of a band or all the instruments, these may just be the headphones for you.\\n\\nAre these on a level of the Bose QuietComfort 15, 25, 35 etc? No. Those start at, if you're lucky, $235, basically take what I paid and add on $200, which for some including myself is some scratch. It's part of the reason I'm not giving these two stars for their music and adding almost another full two stars. These do a pretty good job of active noise canceling, noble even, and that's what many people may be trying to find headphones that can at a lower or, okay I'll say it, cheap, price-point, and these just may be the best for that: Cheap headphones that actually get active noise canceling right. So to recap, need cheap active noise canceling headphones and don't care that much about how music sounds? If these are in the price range I paid &#62;$40, by all means, you could waste you money worse in other ways.","[]","B015CVOEW6","B015CVOEW6","AF77XJ6ZPIPXYG3YB73G2XXQHUOQ","2017-01-17 12:11:22.000","0","False","504"
"273660","1","Fine for android phone, better off in the trash for windows tablets/laptops.","Sony has a long way to go with their wireless projectors.\\n\\nThe image is fine for the lumen, sharp at various distances, but the only way that this projector will work reliably with a windows device (in my experience) is with a wired connection.  Unfortunately the UI/Ux is crap.  It must be navigated with a flimsy nudge-click-wheel, and by default goes to a menu rather than trying to do anything useful when powered on.  It takes a fair amount of maneuvering which must be visually guided in order to start projecting.  Pretty much any other company could do far better with the software design.\\n\\nIf you plan to use this projector wirelessly with anything but an android device, DO NOT BUY.  This projector works fine with my phone (Nexus 5), but is absolute trash with my Surface Pro 4.\\n\\nSupport from Sony on this projector is also garbage.  If you search for connection issues, you will see official sony representatives telling people to use a cable and calling it a solution.  You will see clueless advice on network adapter configurations, none of which will solve your problem.\\n\\nThe secret to getting this projector to work with any device that supports miracast centers around setting your network adapter to utilize the 2.4Ghz band ONLY.  If you have one of these and are looking for a solution, give this a shot -- Open up Device Manager, find your network adapter (Marval AVASTAR in my case).  From Device Manager, right click on the adapter and go to properties.  There will be an advanced tab.  In the advanced tab, change the value of the 'Band' property to '2.4Ghz Only'.  Now you should be able to connect to the device that you've probably lost a couple days of your life on both ends trying to make work.\\n\\nIt could be I have a defective unit.  It could be the issue is on Microsoft's end.  Given the complete incompetence and lack of support from Sony on Windows connectivity issues, and the level of annoyance this product has caused, this one is going to sit around useless unless for some reason I need to mirror my phone display.\\n\\nOh, projecting also drains the battery faster than it can charge via USB, so it's not even good for wired scenarios.","[]","B01LXRSGSV","B01LXRSGSV","AEON3RPTWWJE24L6KQP2HN73KYCA","2017-09-28 17:41:14.660","8","False","504"

These headphones not only surprised my, but blew me away. They originally caught my eye because of all the reviews, but there's so much more to be excited about!\\n\\n1) The came super fast, but I don't know if that's just because of prime, but always an upside, I got to use them less than 12 hours after I ordered them.\\n\\n2) the packaging was nice. It came in a professional box that boasted quality. It was actually so nice I'm not sure I want to throw it away quite yet.\\n\\n3) Upon opening I was happy to find the case, an Android/iPhone cord (i know! Awesome! It can charge both!!), and a car charger! All seem pretty nice, but WAY nicer than what I was expecting. The case is small, and holds the headphones and their charger well. (it could probably fit the phone charger too)\\n\\n4) the headphones are good for the price, not even taking into account all the goodies. After receiving it I was just itching to write a review! What a pleasant surprise!\\n\\n**********EDIT**********\\nWhelp. As much as I didn't want it to be true, all the 1 star reviews ended up being right. Even thought they look perfect, the started to fail. First, the reception on the ear buds got worse. I started to notice it when I would leave my phone on the dresser and pay in bed listening to something; it would start to break up if my body was between the phone and the right earbud. I didn't think much of it at first, I'm pretty easy going after all. However, it got worse and worse until I couldn't even leave the phone in my pocket because it would start to break up. Now I can't get it to play music without my phone being less than a couple feet away and with nothing in between. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, the left earbud gave out, refusing to even squeak any sound.\\n\\nBasically, if you're reviewing the reviews for these headphones just know that the one star reviews are true.

"841460","4","A Bit of a Science Experiment But Works in the End","So, like most things home automation, this is both quirky and frustrating. But in the end, it works and can make your network more robust potentially solving some connectivity issues.\\n\\nThe instructions that come with this unit are worthless. However, there are some product sheets on the web at the manufacturers website which are more helpful. I am using this with a Wink system with more than 35 devices plus sensors in a house of about 5000 sf. Wink itself has improved substantially over the last two years however so many factors influence connectivity that even a robust mesh network can still be intermittent.\\n\\nHere is what I learned. Pairing the device with Wink requires you to put the HUB and the Extender in the same room. On the Wink app, go to the Hub page 'settings' and press on the Hub name. A list of options will appear. Choose 'Z Wave controls.'\\n\\nPress 'Inclusion Mode' and then press the button on the side of the Extender when you see the blue light flashing on the Wink Hub.\\n\\nThe extender will pair and will show up as an 'unknown device' on the Hub page with a little software switch next to it. Flip that switch on (although Wink says it doesn't matter.)\\n\\nThe extender has an RGB LED which will light up green for a second or two but then will go black even though the instructions in the box say the light will stay lit. You can test the 'health' of the connection by pressing and holding the LED switch on the side of the extender. It will turn green and then purple. Let it go when it turns purple and the extender will test itself on the mesh network and report back. Green means strong, Purple is OK and Red is poor connection.\\n\\nThe placement of these devices is so critical that you must experiment. Getting good results requires taking some time to adjust locations of Hub and Extender within your mesh network. A good trick is to use the Zwave Control page 'Zwave Network Rediscovery' switch on the Wink app to have the network configure itself in the background after you have placed the devices where you want them. Rediscovery takes 10 minutes or more but you can use the system while it is configuring itself.\\n\\nIn the end, my frustration turned to success and all devices seem to be working reliably.","[]","B01M6CKJXC","B01M6CKJXC","AGFMLABA572T23BUGAUUWNGFTKBQ","2017-04-27 22:33:21.000","12","True","504"
"360417","5","Excellent...so far.","Two or three years or so ago I bought some cheap bluetooth sports headphones (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LP6CFEC/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  Sound quality was great but they didn't feel secure when running and died in a fairly alarming way after about five uses (would not charge and got incredibly hot).  This put me off bluetooth for sports headphones for a while but when my last wired headphones died after the usual six weeks or so of summer-sweaty running I thought I'd give these puppies a try, mainly because I have been modestly impressed by Anker's iPhone charging cables (they seem to last a bit longer at the price point than most).\\n\\nInitial impression was these were BIG.  And HEAVY.  But having run with them a few times now neither issue seems to be a problem and I really don't notice the size or weight in practice.  Plus it is nice not to have to charge them every time I run (I'm assuming at least a good chunk of the size/weight is attributable to a higher capacity battery).  The connecting cord seems longer than necessary but I didn't find that a practical issue either, nor is the fairly chunky control -- which I like positioned on the cord rather than on one or the other earbud. As others have mentioned they come with a dizzying array of options to get the perfect fit but for me they felt very comfortable with just the default ear cushions that came attached. This is no small achievement given that on average if you have to go for multiple runs to experiment with 10 or so different fitting options you have blown through most of the useful life of the average sports headphones\\n\\nPairing is a breeze and sound quality more than acceptable for running purposes. Build quality also seems a cut above and makes me hopeful these will last at least a few months, especially as we move into the non-sweaty running season here in the Northeast.  Only time will tell on that. So yeah, a few bucks more than the cheapest bluetooth headphones but for the moment I'm thinking that for around $35 these represent a nice sweet spot between the junky low-end and the insane prices for &#34;prestige&#34; brands that have at best only the same durability.","[]","B0721MP41Q","B0721MP41Q","AFJSOVXLFZM4Q7XMY2ODR3KRPSWQ","2017-09-19 23:00:40.971","2","True","504"

Have increased my rating to two stars reflecting that exceptional support. Ring Support replaced the camera, replacement amazingly arrived the following day, but unfortunately the issues experienced with the first unit as per my earlier review below were the same with the second unit. To their credit, Ring refunded the full price I had paid for the camera and the solar panel. My conclusion is that the night vision capability of the Stick Up Cam is so poor as to really not be of much use and that night vision capability is simply not anywhere close to the capability of the Ring Pro doorbell that I also have and which works reasonably well. The StickUp camera also takes longer to activate than the Ring Pro. It works reasonably well otherwise during daylight hours. I look forward to hearing that the latest technology that is present in the Ring Pro will be installed in this product. Solar panel works very well and as advertised keeping the camera unit charged without an electric outlet available.\\n\\nOriginal review:\\nDoesn't work well. Takes forever to activate. Night view is useless, very dark red tinted screen, so dark you can't see anything. Ring pro night vision by comparison is reasonably good.To claim that night vision works on the stick-up cam is false advertising. You would think that if they have a camera that works well in their Ring pro doorbell, that the same would be in their other products such as this one. That is what I foolishly assumed. Have been trying to seek help from Ring support but they don't answer emails. Extremely disappointing!\\n\\nAs with all Ring products, requires wifi strength not available in almost all homes so you will need to buy a Chime pro wifi extender for each Ring product, another $49, and install that no further than a few feet from where the outdoor device is located.\\n\\nDuring daylight hours, video quality is OK if not great. It and the Ring Pro doorbell I also own work most of the time in terms of activating when there is motion, but not always.Trouble is that security devices such as these need to work every time, not only most of the time.\\n\\nSolar panel works as intended and keeps unit properly charged as advertised.","[]","B01G2J0YEE","B01G2J0YEE","AESTJBEPXNUUGDL7FPRRLWU6FJPA","2017-03-11 16:23:37.000","27","True","504"

The second most important thing to do, if you're using a Single Sign-on (Microsoft account), is to configure your account.  You do that by going into Settings &#62; Accounts &#62; Email and Apps.  This will make getting system and app updates far easier.  The next thing to do, is go to Settings &#62; System &#62; Tablet Mode set the device to operate in Tablet Mode (Use tablet mode).  Finally, do NOT go to System Update and update your OS.  Do a search for Fall Creators Update Download and there will be a link to Microsoft to download the installer.  This avoids the pain of updating to the Creators update, and then once again to the Fall Creators Update.  Once you have the OS updated, take a moment to update the system apps and download all the apps you want.\\n\\nIf you're purchasing this tablet, make sure to purchase a fast MicroSD card with it.  I had a 32GB one lying around, but an older, slower one.  You'll appreciate the benefits of the speedier MicroSD cards offered today, as well as the space.  If you're purchasing a screen protectors for this case, understand that they don't prevent the screen from breaking.  Screen protectors are designed to protect the screen from scratches.  Since these screens, unlike most smartphones, do not have Gorilla or Dragon glass screens, it's imperative to have some kind of protection.  So, if you are planning on purchasing this tablet, consider including a package of screen protectors as well.\\n\\n I purchased this tablet to replace a Kindle.  I haven't yet tested it in that respect, however speed wise it blows it away.  The tablet isn't going to win any speed tests, but normal daily usage isn't an issue.

"638439","4","Not too bad","I installed this unit in my vehicle, and so far so good.  Video quality seems good, and light sensitivity at night seems better than some units I've tried.  My only complaints:\\n1)  The status information (date/time, speed, etc.) on the screen is so small that it is basically unreadable.  Confirming that this unit is capturing the correct time and date is impossible unless you put your nose right up to it, and even then the size of the text is almost too small for the screen to resolve.\\n2)  The up/down adjustment is incremental rather than continuous (there are small teeth that interlock to prevent the camera head from shifting under vibration).  While this is good for maintaining the aim of the camera, the increments are way too large, and I'm not sure why this type of adjustment is even necessary given the low mass of this unit.  Each incremental adjustment is so large that unless your windshield is at just the right angle, the camera is going to point too high or too low.  I had to choose between aiming my camera at a downward angle that captured my entire dashboard plus the hood of my vehicle, or at an upward angle that would cause the camera to miss what's going on immediately in front of my vehicle.  In between would have been perfect, but the increments were too large to allow that.\\n3)  Every now and then the camera powers up with the question &#34;Movie Recovery?&#34; on the screen, and until you hit the OK button the unit will just sit there indefinitely.  While it's in this condition it is not recording.  So if you don't look at the camera regularly to see if it's actually recording, you can drive for hours with a disabled camera.  I think what happens is that the camera didn't properly store the last video file on the previous power down so it tries to recover that file when it powers up, but what it should do is automatically try to recover the file without waiting for operator input--why would we not want to recover it?  In my opinion this is a useless feature that can have serious consequences if you don't realize it's in this mode and then get into an accident.\\n\\nHowever, overall this seems to be a good unit, but I don't think I'll buy another one next time because of the issues that it has, especially #3.","[]","B00OTZWJE2","B00OTZWJE2","AHSXSAR4NAYKQRKEH34PMKQZ7QNQ","2017-05-23 11:45:12.000","1","True","504"

I loved the navigation and Bluetooth abilities so I bought this based on a recommendation from our installer.  He told me it was just as good as the Pioneer at a much cheaper price.  Well, he was right about the cheaper price.  Now, I didn't want to spend as much on my truck since it isn't used for any family travel.  So, this radio is certainly serviceable. There are just a few quarks:\\n1) As mentioned in other reviews, the clock will loose time if you don't have it set to navigation.  I have a 15 minute drive to work and it will be off by 5-7 minutes (slow) by the time I get there.  I emailed the company asking about updates shortly after I bought the radio.  No response.\\n2) If I am in radio mode and switch to navigation, the volume will either increase or decrease.  Then, once I press the map to launch it, the volume changes again.  For me, not a deal breaker, but it is annoying; especially, when the volume increases dramatically.\\n3) It always defaults to radio when it is turned on.  It would really be nice if it remembered the last mode I was in.\\n\\nIn one of the reviews, someone mentioned they couldn't update the maps.  I am not sure what problem they were having.  I was able to turn off navigation and remove the microSD card from the unit.  I placed the card into my computer and launched the Naviextras program and it updated the maps for me.  The latest they have for the US at this time is 3rd quarter of 2016.  This is the same for the Pioneer.\\n\\nMovies play fine from DVD.  Since I don't watch them in the truck much, I can't remember how the movies looked through the microSD slot, but I know I tried it and must not have had problems.\\n\\nI have my connected to a backup camera and it works great.\\n\\nOverall, the radio is an OK device for the price you pay for it.

It has less features than the Asus and constantly has to be restarted. It's 3:30pm and I've restarted it twice already. I've given this junk 2 months, I think I'm about ready to cut my losses and put the Asus back in. Besides the restarts, it's not nearly as fast as the old Asus. After I had the Netgear setup, I installed the Asus in my workshop behind my house. as an access point for the shop. While sitting only a few feet from the R8000 the speeds from the Asus some 40 feet away in another building had twice as fast speeds on every device we tried. Wired not so bad, wireless is weak! No WOL feature. For $250 this is unbelievable. We used to be able to cast YouTube from our phones to the TV flawlessly - no more. That's more miss than hit now. I really hoped that going with a company that specializes in &#34;networking&#34; and putting up that much cash I would have gotten a quality product. I'd call tech support, but I've heard the horror stories and I can't imagine what they could tell me to fix the restarts. Netgear - never again!\\n\\nUpdate: Tonight, I sold my R8000 for less than half of what I paid for it. A very expensive lesson. Although I always had the latest firmware installed, this router was no match for hackers. Security takes a backseat with this router. You're unable to change the user name, &#34;admin&#34; is always available. Netgear claims it has an SPI firewall, I guess we can take there word for it since you can't actually see it. I went back to my old Asus and I wish I had never strayed. Now, the internet and all our wireless devices work as they should. My  Asus is far more concerned about my security than the R8000. The R8000's biggest flaw, to me, is its price. It's a mediocre router, at best, with few features and lousy securities. It was a lesson in &#34;because it costs more doesn't mean it's better&#34;.","[]","B00KWHMR6G","B00KWHMR6G","AGMO25DZVL4LZ66LRYIUSXGB46ZA","2017-05-18 21:12:22.000","0","False","504"
"336089","4","Best Case For iPad Pro 9.7""","I've had this case for several weeks now and, overall, I like it very much.  It appears to be the best keyboard case available right now for the iPad Pro 9.7&#34;.  Here are the pros, and one con:\\nPros:\\n* Extremely rugged\\n* Keyboard easily detaches and re-attaches (the magnetic latch works very well)\\n* Love the backlighting on the keys -- lots of choices -- very handy in a dark room\\n* Good battery life\\n* Typing feels good -- I type fairly fast and haven't had any problems\\n* iPad function key row is separate -- you don't have to hold down the function key to change volume, etc.\\n* If you drop it, not only does the case protect the iPad, but the case is rugged enough that it doesn't break either (can't say that about many other cases),\\n\\nThe one con:\\n* You can't adjust the brightness from the keyboard.  Man, I miss that function (had it with an older iPad and a different case).\\n  I've somewhat worked around this via Siri (just say &#34;brightness&#34; when Siri is activated).  If someone has a better way of doing this, I'd love to hear about it.\\n\\nThe weight is not a problem for me, nor is the extra bulk.  I like the fact that it is so solid.\\nThe Apple Pencil will not fit into the lightning port, so I bought a small extension cable for it.  I like that better anyway.  I didn't like having the pencil stick straight out of the side of the iPad.\\nThe case doesn't rotate for portrait mode, but I haven't missed that much (I just turn it sideways).\\n\\nAnother interesting benefit is that the case magnet will actually keep the case in place when it is on a metal desk. This only works if the case is open, but it is handy at times, and it makes the case less likely to fall off a table in an industrial setting.\\n\\nOverall a very good keyboard case that does what it is supposed to do -- protect my iPad.  I would give it 5 stars if it only had the two buttons to adjust the brightness.","[]","B01FM8HMWS","B01DBEFRU4","AF65N4WSTNBO2V4VJDML2RE73ROA","2017-04-24 19:25:21.000","12","True","504"
"781768","3","Iffy Hardware, surly software, still bought more.","We had one fail on us after almost exactly a year of ownership. It just stopped working. It's past the warranty, obviously, and we hadn't purchased the protection for it through Amazon. The diagnosis based on lazy internet research is that the motherboard needs swapping out. The internets make it sound super easy to do, but the parts are surprisingly difficult to find. Perhaps the takeaway here is that you should always buy the protection? I guess that's a way to view it. I would kind of hope Amazon could make something that would last more than a year for just sitting on a shelf.\\n\\nThat said, I did buy two more on Black Friday because they were so cheap. You're reading this, correctly. One broke, so I bought two. I get how that sounds. I won't defend myself, but here's the logic (if you call it that):\\n\\n- I would not have bought again, but I already have a first gen Echo, the big fella, and it works fine. I don't feel like replacing my ecosystem.\\n- Had a not had a working Echo when the dot failed I would not have bought again. Google Home is here, late to market, yes, but a viable option.\\n- I wouldn't have bought at $50. It's too much of a risk for something is at best a convenient substitute for a smart phone.\\n- At $30, they were worth one more shot. If one fails again, I won't be replacing though.\\n\\nThat said, when working, the Alexa system is a fairly nice way to smart connect a home. Yes, we can do everything from our phones, but it is really convenient to yell, &#34;Alexa, Santa Claus is coming,&#34; and have all the Christmas lights turn on. It can be an exercise in frustration, however as the voice recognition still devolves into a bad rendition of &#34;Who's on First&#34; whenever Alexa decides she really doesn't want to understand me. I've seen my wife screaming at the top of her lungs, &#34;Alexa! Turn on the bedroom light!&#34; to which Alexa responds, &#34;I don't recognize that light&#34;. Then I say the same thing, and Alexa says, &#34;Ok&#34;.","[]","B01DFKC2SO","B01K8B8YA8","AHCSIZ6F2Q7PB6PONWGUAJ3KZLMA","2017-12-18 21:34:48.463","1","True","504"
"425688","3","OK, but I wouldn't recommend it.","Bought this for my camera equipment because I wanted something that disguised an expensive camera. It works real well but for 5 things :-\\n1.  First is that it has no &#34;top of the bag handle&#34;. Yes it's a sling bag, but so many times I tried to grab the top while passing through airport check but there was nothing to grab. After a while it just became tiring. I thought of having a tailor stitch a handle, but it would be difficult to find the same colour canvas, etc.\\n2.  Secondly the leather strap press-pins at the front of the bag (to close the front flap) just don't align and snap in easily. Closing the bag is a bit cumbersome. You have to be intentional, stop everything and do this focused. That too got tiring after some time.\\n3.  The side pockets are really neat, but the leather covers (not the leather straps that close the pockets but the flap at the top) are very short. I wish they were an inch longer . I found that if I made the mistake of putting batteries or small items in them then they'd fall out if the bag tipped over. Irritating.\\n4.  The bag leaks at the top. There is an internal zip, so things are safe. But the corner ends have a flap that is tiny! Doesn't keep rain out. Again this is a matter of poor bag design. If they were 1 or 2 inches longer, they would be perfect.\\n5.  The shoulder strap is good but the weight bearing part is a small, wider canvas stitch-on. Not very helpful.\\n\\nI finally gave up on the bag and bought a MOACC canvas bag (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E20UZ86/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1). It addresses some of the problems I was facing - has a top handle; has great strap padding; the side pocket flaps are big; the press-pin front closers are still a bother - finicky, but I think I can modify those with velcro (sigh - there's no perfect bag); the rain can still leak in (same problem as the Kattee bag) so I guess I'll have to live with that.","[]","B00Y2I33J6","B07BVDYMHP","AFDCWSBLIYLT5EMVLHHJANF2PFTQ","2017-11-18 09:29:35.000","4","True","504"
"559682","5","Thank you Jamie Joy!","Just wanted to bring a well-deserved recognition to GW for this product and most importantly the support they provide to make sure the buyer understands what they are getting and sets their expectations right. I researched for more than three months about the NVR's on the market, their capabilities, and functions. I bought a house in 2015 and my purpose, given watching too many movies, I wanted to have at least a basic surveillance/security system in place that is reliable and does the job. I could not afford to buy a preset package as it seemed quite expensive, therefore I set out dividing the purchase into separate items. Got two PTZ cams on eBay, a beautiful Chinese copy of Sony under an unbranded name. I was so sure the system will recognize them as ONFIV was majorly advertised and just went for it because of the cheap price. Got another four Wansview cams from Amazon, this time they had at least a reputable online website to check out service if needed. Got the switch from Best Buy clearance rack and here I am in need of an NVR to recognize and work with all these impromptu items. The 3Tb hard drive made sense to buy separately on Amazon as well and figured that for about 30 days of recordings, with 6 cams on 2 Megapixels 1080 cams, is the set up I need.\\nI consider myself average as I read and research everything I can before doing something, and my basic computer understanding comes from a few years of Apple IT support when they launch the iPhone in 2007.  So finally, here I am all pieces together and the four cams would not show on the NVR interface.\\nMy first help email went out, and 24h later Jamie Joy from GW, I believe they are based in San Diego, came to the rescue. We had perhaps 3-4 sessions of 30 minutes, setting the appointment times and she would call me. We went over everything, all cams set up nicely, patiently listening and providing options. The NVR alarm buzzer would go off and wake up the whole house on motion detection, and although checked off all its components it seemed like had a mind of its own. She figured out everything, can't be happier with their services and my purchase. Hope I did not bore anybody to death with my story, my purpose was to make sure you THE BUYER know they've got your back, all because of Jamie. Kudos to you!!!","[]","B01LYGQUY1","B01LYGQUY1","AENYSMYOYDI3F7IBAXDYSEGA5E4A","2017-06-29 04:37:57.896","7","True","504"
"481002","5","Awesome tripod for photography","There is no better tripod in this price range..probably even above this price range. It is &#34;very&#34; well made and sturdy. I like that you can use this tripod on either side..with the head up or down. This comes in handy for switching between photography and videography. I didn't know how valuable this would be to me when I initially purchased it because at the time I was only doing photography, but now I do. I thought that this tripod could not hold the heavier weight of all the accessories that I have attached to it for video (see images) because every once and a blue moon it would creep down. It really wasn't a big deal for me because whenever it would happen I'd simply adjust and make sure things were extra tight and that fixed the problem. I guess in reality it could've been user error if tightening things down solved the problem and I never really never took the time to sit down and troubleshoot the cause. So after a year or so of really putting this thing to the test I decided to write my review giving this tripod 4 stars. A couple of days after writing my review I came home to large box from Ravelli. I was confused because I hadn't ordered anything or even spoken to them about anything. Anyway when I opened the box it was a brand new set of legs! I was totally blown away. So I went up stairs to try them out but in the process I realized something. 1 - the head can be removed (because that's what Ravelli sent me..a full fledge tripod simply without the head **Awesome! and 2 when the tripod is in the position with the head side up, the legs lock into place. This lead me take a closer look at how the legs work when the head is facing down. Thats when I realized that they don't have the same locking grooves when upside down. However the legs are still very secure in that position but obviously if your adding as much weight as I do, it would make more sense for me to put the head on the other end.  At any rate I tested the new legs and the old legs over and over and I had NO issues. This tripod gets a 5 star rating from me and Ravelli's customer service is the best I've ever experienced.\\n\\nIn case this confused you, I will update this review with a video review from my Youtube channel -Keyser Reveal","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61h9fHJqtgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61h9fHJqtgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61h9fHJqtgL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JAYKVelQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JAYKVelQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JAYKVelQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LIlVLRucL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LIlVLRucL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LIlVLRucL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MlnpxWxVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MlnpxWxVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MlnpxWxVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NN5qrHD6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NN5qrHD6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NN5qrHD6L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B002IFPY2O","B002IFPY2O","AFLFQZCGPOC3VJ4EW2662OZHKSHA","2017-02-20 22:37:45.000","2","True","504"
"947239","5","but other Mosiso products had good reviews, and other cases for the new MacBook ...","When I purchased this 4 weeks ago, there weren't any reviews yet, but other Mosiso products had good reviews, and other cases for the new MacBook Pros hadn't been getting good reviews, so I figured it was worth taking a chance.  I must have gotten an early production piece, as it didn't come with the cleaning cloth or the screen protector, but a quick email to Mosiso (through Amazon) and they apologized for the missing parts and shipped a new cover out, which got here within 2 days. Great customer support.\\n\\nMy initial impression was that it wasn't as solid as the Speck case that I had for an older MacBook Pro (that also cost twice as much) and it didn't fit as well, but I think the fit has more to do with the size and shape of the new MacBook Pro than anything: there just isn't much for the back of the cover to grab on to. But it doesn't come off, it is just a little loose around the ports. It also doesn't add much weight to the new computer (can't say that about the Speck), and it has nice rubber feet that keep the computer from sliding around. It even came with a replacement set of stick-on feet (that will probably get lost). The vents on the bottom and sides works quite well to keep the computer from getting too hot, and work with the feet that keep the computer a little farther off the desk surface than the factory feet do.\\n\\nThe cover does add a nice shine to the space grey MacBook Pro, although it does show some scratching from normal use. I'm sure all cases get scratched up, it is just more apparent on a clear, shiny case.\\n\\nThere aren't any instructions with the case, but there are instructions here on this site for how to install it. Pretty easy. Start at the back, pull towards the front and snap in place.\\n\\nSo, overall, I'm quite happy with the cover/case for the new computer. I'm not sure if it offers as much protection from fall as the Speck case is reputed to offer, but it is keeping my new computer nice and shiny, doesn't add a noticeable amount of weight or dimension to the computer, and seems like it keeps the computer more stable on a desk surface (it doesn't want to skate away on a slick surface). I would definitely buy it again.","[]","B01MSLWTGP","B07FNGV2MG","AFTSCSW6YK5PIZBH4IGPYVRH2UVQ","2017-01-14 18:38:49.000","9","True","504"
"769561","4","Fantastic device and an amazing price, but battery life is less than impressive","The old iPad went to my son, the new iPad is the domain of my wife so where is Daddy's tablet? Well now it's here, this wonderfully designed and so far excellent Fire HD 10. It may be a refurb, but it seems brand new with no cosmetic damage or the usual signs of having been previously owned. I must confess, the first thing I did after opening the box (packaging a little reminiscent of Apple's efficient origami box packaging) was to &#34;hack&#34; it to add the Google Play Store. Thankfully it wasn't terribly involved and gave me expanded access to more apps than are available just from Amazon.\\nSpeaking of Apps from Amazon, I'm loving this whole Underground thing. Hundreds of apps and games for free. The same ones you'd pay a  few bucks for on the Google Play store.\\nIn addition to this tablet, I got a great case and a 64GB micro SD card to round out the experience.\\nSo far, I love this device. The case adds some weight but it's worth it to not feel like I'm going to drop the Fire every time I pick it up; the housing is just so smooth. So definitely get a case. I haven't come close to using even half the storage space on the micro SD card yet and I've loaded several seasons of various anime shows, movies, games, and almost me entire digital comic collection (500+ books) onto this thing.\\nMy only complaint, and reason this is four stars instead of five, is the battery life. I understand that under normal use with the bright screen, great sounding stereo speakers and wifi, that I should expect the battery to drain fairly steadily. But it does it in sleep mode too??? I will put away the tablet at night with a full battery and pull it out at lunch the next day to find it at 29%. That's not great at all, especially in a travel scenario. Contrast that with an iPad (which is thinner and lighter); that battery can last a week depending on usage. That's because the iPad actually sleeps when you turn it off. I feel like the Fire is &#34;sleepwalking&#34; or something during the night? Maybe it doesn't actually hibernate like an iPad and it's just the screen that turns off, I don't know. It does charge quickly, but I don't like how often I have to plug it in.","[]","B00ZAQGNM8","B00ZAQGNM8","AGATS24LQD3MLTF4EOJ4P47IZGGA","2017-01-19 23:03:42.000","12","True","504"
"112679","2","Luma has easy set up but lackluster performance - get Orbi instead if you want faster speeds","The set up for luma is simple and while it does improve the reach of your wifi to additional parts of your home speeds the performance lags way behind other products like Orbi.  I had purchased Luma to get better coverage throughout our 3 story house after going through other wifi routers like the ASUS ac-rt88 and dlink 850. While it did extend the reach of the wifi signals, speeds where often slow if you weren't right in front of one of the nodes. The speeds aren't due to the backhaul since I switched over to using Ethernet to connect my lumas (original wifi only connected node speeds were slow). For example, I have one of my nodes in the living room and with wifi only connection between the lumas I would only get speed test results of ~30Mbps sitting 10ft away on the couch.  (MacBook Pro connected via wifi). When connected via Ethernet backhaul I would hit speeds of ~170Mbps. I have Comcast with their 200Mbps+ package.  If I move to the attached dining room around the corner ~ 15ft away, speeds would drop ~8Mbps even with the Ethernet backhaul (granted there is a stone fireplace in the way). I decided to give Orbi a try instead when I saw their 3 pack as I was wandering through Costco.  Orbi doesn't support Ethernet backhaul and isn't a true mesh but has a dedicated 5Ghz backhaul between a satellite node and the main router. I placed the Orbi nodes in the same locations as the previous Luma nodes and speed test results were much faster: living room Luma:170Mbps Orbi:225Mbps; dining room Luma:8Mbps Orbi:42Mbps; Bedroom Luma:20Mbps Orbi:175Mbps.  I think your results will vary depending on the construction and layout of your home.  If you're looking for the best wifi performance, I'd recommend spending a bit more and getting Orbi. There were some features on the luma that I did like (auto blocking traffic out to some sites they thought were harmful but think there were some issues with false positives like it would block traffic to some new relic data collection urls that some sites used to monitor the performance of their sites - we use new relic at work so I know they are not malicious). Other than that Orbi supports parental controls, pausing access, guest network as well as ddns (which luma doesn't)","[]","B017DV1BPG","B017DV1BPG","AEPWSQN6QKWGXILMAX7FKEQNC44A","2017-04-02 16:42:18.000","5","True","504"

The device picks up voices fine and no one on the other end of my phone call has had trouble hearing me.

"348853","5","Phenomenal sound","The manual is a pdf file on a CD. Read that first. Once I got past the Japanese setup screens (the language is the icon with &#34;ABC&#34; on it), it was pretty simple. However, the sound was like an echo chamber on everything but stereo. Once I set up the WiFi, it downloaded a firmware update (it took 20 minutes) and all of that went away. The sound is superb and smooth across all the speakers in my 7.1 setup. Of all the possible sound settings, 7-channel stereo seems the best on everything but Blu-ray, where &#34;Surround&#34; allows for true 5.1 and 7.1 sound. That's to be expected since the source is typically stereo. The sound on movies like &#34;Master and Commander&#34; is startlingly accurate and realistic, and also for movies over WiFi, which likewise transmit 5.1. The remote is not a universal remote, although many of the functions for a CD or Blu-ray player can be handled with it. The TV button is not for the TV. I think it actually means &#34;video out&#34; and that's where some eccentricities show up. If you turn off the TV, it turns off the amp. That's normally a good thing; but not if you want to continue to listen to a CD and only had the TV on to change a setting. And if you turn on the amp first, and then turn on the TV, the TV will not play through the amp until you turn the amp off and back on. Cute. But I do have an older TV that requires me to use audio out (RCA plugs) linked to Audio1 on the amp. It's probably not a problem on newer TVs where the HDMI handles it. The amp produces the upper frequencies beautifully and cleanly, and the timber of the violins and cellos is exquisite. The bass is deep, rich, and smooth. I had an Onkyo which I thought handled those things really well until I heard this Yamaha. It noticeably outperforms it. I am VERY happy with it.\\n11/15 - I resolved the TV vs. amp issues (sound, power off). On the amp, choose setup, HDMI, and turn off HDMI control. Then they operate independently of each other, and the amp sound will auto-adjust to whatever the input is.","[]","B01BY7YUKI","B01F7SU6BM","AE73HR3JON3RWW6XQ274P6TO7TGA","2017-11-05 15:27:59.149","37","True","504"
"242759","2","Must read honest review of 8 month owner","I've owned this TV for 8 months now and have a solid well rounded review I would like to share.  The unit does have it's pros without a doubt, but this review is unfortunately a bad one.\\n\\nFirst, the TV is without a doubt a true dream when it comes to picture quality.  The blacks as so many mention are nothing short of amazing as well as it's color reproduction.  I won't go on to repeat what many others have accurately told already, but the review are true that allude to how good the picture is.\\n\\nSecondly, my experience which leads me to leave a 2 star review is based upon image burn and image retention, which also leads into dealing with LG's customer service and waiting for someone to come and look at the unit.  I should first mention, that while the picture is top notch, this is true only when the input source is 1080p or 4k.  Other sets, especially Samsung and Sony do a far superior job at more common input sources from your most commonly watches sources like news or cable feeds which are 720p and 1080i.  This LG set seems to only shine when the input is 1080p or 4k/HDR in my opinion.  Last years model Samsung KS8000 for example displays a much better picture on 720p/1080i sources.\\n\\nImage retention/image burn - if you troll the net deep enough about these sets/models from LG, you'll find enough people asking about this topic, and it is true.  I have a burnt in ghosted image of our local news stations '11' logo in the bottom right corner of the TV, and another faint image in the opposite corner on the left side.  8 months old and still under LG's warranty, it has taken 7 weeks to get someone in my area out to look at it which results in replacing the panel.

By this time, you know what it is and what could I say that hasn't already been said ...\\n\\nBut a couple of tips and observations:\\n- I've noticed that even if you don't change the Wake Word, and you have two in the same room (why I don't know, except maybe when changing settings), they will both wake, but only the closest one will answer. Cool.\\n- If you plan to use the audio output jack, make absolutely sure that you use a quality USB power source. I made the mistake of using a spare USB port from a nearby router and got all kinds of noise and interference. When I switched back to using the supplied adapter, the output was clean and quiet.\\n- Here is how I use one of my echos (oh yes, I have more than one: both were gifts) to switch between multiple outputs\\n(1) I use two Bluetooth speakers. The primary one (Bose) is listed first, and will be chosen by default when you say &#34;Alexa Connect&#34;\\n(2) I use the audio output jack for my home theater, and it plays automatically when I say &#34;Alexa Disconnect&#34;\\n(3) The second Bluetooth plays whenever I turn off my little Bose speaker and then say &#34;Alexa Connect&#34;.\\nSo, while you don't get them playing all at once, I can easily select to play to 3 different speakers without messing with the APP.\\n\\nFinally, I like to walk around with my echo sometimes, so I use USB chargers.\\n\\nHere are two I like (I included pictures):\\nLooks way cool: [[ASIN:B00XHDVXL2 New Design Portable Power Bank, Vivis Pi Ultra Slim 6000mAh Fashion Facial massager 2-Port Fast Portable Charger External Battery Pack Backup Charger with Makeup Mirror for iPhone 6, 6 plus, iPad Air 2 Mini 3, Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 Edge and More (Black)]]\\nFits in a pocket: [[ASIN:B01M3MK1UE Smartwatch Charger (White) - Portable 2 x AA USB Charger with Built-n Light]]","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mLjY+MTtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mLjY+MTtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mLjY+MTtL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OCK3hijxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OCK3hijxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OCK3hijxL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01DFKC2SO","B01K8B8YA8","AHYM4DROYXSMGVIUZGPCM5R4QRBQ","2017-01-19 03:47:25.000","8","True","504"
"831255","5","KDLinks Has Set the Standard with Its R100.","Whenever I buy something, I always try to do research/comparisons to make sure I'm buying the absolute best.  A lot of &#34;hype&#34; out there, and reading reviews is critical.  But, when it came to buying a dash-cam, it became very clear that the ONLY choice was the KDLinks.  The dilemma: Which one?  The DX2 or the R100.  From reading reviews, watching YouTube videos and looking at the specifications, they BOTH excelled.  So, I bought BOTH.  Quite honestly, I am pleased with both.  Both are a snap to install (good installation how-to on YouTube).  I know that no matter which model you choose, you can't go wrong.  I tend to look at the DX2 as a &#34;portable&#34; which would be easy to deinstall/install from one vehicle to another (i.e. if you were to go on a trip and want a dash-cam in your rental).  The R100 is more of a static (permanent) unit.  Gotta say that while video quality of the DX2 and R100 is superb, I absolutely LOVE the video quality of the R100 with its 1296P Front & 1080P Rear.  I bought the R100 for protection and documentation of driving and mishaps; however, because of its quality, I can also see using it as a replacement of my GoPro while driving (for scenery along the roadway) and be able to use the GoPro for recording other activities while driving (i.e. antics of my passengers and me during the drive!).  As far as I'm concerned, KDLinks is &#34;the&#34; standard in dash-cam, especially the R100.\\nAddendum: I have a 2016 Kia Sorento top-of-the-line SUV with every bell-and-whistle imaginable.  I installed the R100 in the Kia since it was the more professional of the two units.  Since then, I've had numerous people rid in my car and compliment me on the R100.  It is so professional looking and reeks of technology that they assumed it was part of the original Kia Sorento.  I'm quite sure that some of them will be KDLINKS customers shortly, if not already.","[]","B01L17EMP4","B01L17EMP4","AHKFUKSM7U7VYSAAPLWAUMI52FUA","2017-04-11 03:21:21.000","2","True","504"
"540588","5","Amazing, Deserves 6/5 Stars","This stuff works better than I could have imagined. I hadn't cleaned my TV screens for years because last time I did (I used Monster's worthless cleaner stuff) I almost went crazy trying to get rid of the streaks. It took a few minutes of cleaning to get my big screen TV's clean with this stuff, but they ended up literally and seriously looking good as new. I wish I took before-and-after pictures, or cleaned one half of the screen at a time, because the difference after cleaning is unbelievable; I can't recommend this stuff enough.\\nI used it to clean: 40&#34; LCD TV, 65&#34; LED TV, 15&#34; LCD laptop screen, tablet screen (without a screen cover), and phone screen (with a screen cover).\\n\\nNOTE: if you get streaks when you first try this it's probably because of all the grime on the screen, so keep using this spray and the clothe and it will get everything cleaned off after a couple minutes.\\n\\nI first tried using this on my older, 40&#34; LCD TV; it had dust and dog slobber on it from the past few years (I've had great danes and when they shake their big, floppy faces they tend to splatter slobber). It was streaky after the first couple wipe downs, but I knew there was a ton of crud on it, so I kept using the spray and flipping around the clothe. I was amazed by how clean and streak-free it ended up, so I immediately tried it on my newer, bigger, nicer 65&#34; LED TV. It had less dust, but enough dog slobber splatter; it cleaned up perfectly fine. I ended up cleaning the rest of the screen in my house with it. Since it's not a harsh chemical I also used it to clean stuff like the keyboard on my laptop and the border of my TV's.\\n\\nThe bottle is big and has plenty of solution to last for years. The fact that it's environmentally friendly, or whatever, doesn't appeal to me, I don't mind cleaning my house with chemicals and bleach and whatnot; however, I guess it's better to be non-toxic instead of hazardous.\\n\\nIt's not the cheapest stuff, but it's definitely worth all the money it costs.","[]","B01054S5FM","B01054S5FM","AG7ABZ3GKFPF5KIQA7ITAIFR5BHA","2017-10-06 01:56:09.984","5","True","504"
"380551","5","Fantastic Shooting Stick","Let me start by saying that I have been hunting for over thirty years and never used a shooting stick, so testing this one was completely new for me.  In a word – this shooting stick is outstanding!  Quick and easy set-up with at least three different uses for this piece of equipment.  Pull up and put the three legs into position for a nice, stable platform.  The pivot ball just above the legs allows for angling in all directions.  There is also a wheel at the bottom of the pole to tighten the pivot ball to reduce angling when desired. The collapsible pole is pretty rigid, offering three clamps for expansion to virtually any size desired from approximately 3 feet to just over 5 feet and everything in between.  The U-shaped yolk is a great support for a firearm no matter the hunter’s position. It allowed me less movement while turkey hunting alone; easier transition from my box call to holding the firearm.\\n\\nThis equipment can also be used for a walking stick.  The legs that snap into place have grooved, rubber footings, which offer more stability than a single or double point of contact.  I don’t know the strength of the overall pole so I don’t know if it would support the complete weight of an adult.  There is a soft handle beneath the yoke for use as a walking stick to help reduce hand fatigue.\\n\\nLast, but certainly not least, this piece of equipment can also be utilized for photography, with a spotting scope or anything else outfitted with a screw-in mounting bracket.  Simply unscrew the U-shaped yolk and reattach your other item to the threaded mount and you’re in business. They even included a rubber cap attached to the handle that fits over and covers the threading mount in the event you wish to use it as a walking stick so you don’t ruin the mount or scratch your hand.\\n\\nThere is a small carabineer clip for use in storing or hanging the shooting stick either in the garage, in your camper, maybe a backpack, or elsewhere.  I have included three photos of the Vanguard shooting stick below.\\n\\nI was truly surprised at the versatility, design and thought put into this equipment.  I am very glad to have had the opportunity to test this piece of equipment and definitely recommend it to others.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Mb1aHdlfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Mb1aHdlfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Mb1aHdlfL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81grxeCBCBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81grxeCBCBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81grxeCBCBL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91fR4ORMZXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91fR4ORMZXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91fR4ORMZXL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01BDYJOAS","B01BDYJOAS","AE2ZQGNWU6PG4HGHOKDNI2XTYE6Q","2017-05-02 20:51:46.000","2","False","504"
"927769","5","Very neat little doorbell.","Great concept. I like being able to see when people are at my door, I work 3rd shift so I sleep during the day, this allows me to see who's at the door without having getting up (amazing!). I also like that I can talk to the person at my door and let them know if I'm coming, and to give me a minute to get around so can answer the door. I bought a Ring 'Chime' so that if my phone is on silent (as it is when I'm sleeping) it will function as a standard doorbell if someone pushes the doorbell - works great.\\n\\nI like the adjustable motion alert settings. I have the sensitivity turned all the way up since I live in the back of a very rural subdivision so it will pick up cars that drive by; there is not a lot of traffic (10 cars drive by my house on a busy day). You can turn down the settings if you want so it only detects people that get close to your door and not cars.\\n\\nSome people said their's lags or is slow, but I have 100gb Internet and a powerful router signal at the doorbell and it performs really well. I use the battery model, it lasts surprisingly long and is easy to charge.  The battery life is great, it lasts several months (less in colder weather/more in warmer).\\n\\nThe only thing that could use improvement is that it only records for 30 seconds and then stops recording.  I noticed in some instances it recorded (for example) the UPS truck pull in my driveway,  but before the guy got out of the truck and walked to my door the 30 second recording ended so I was not able to clearly see the delivery driver or the package. If you answer the motion or ring notification on your smartphone,  the recording will last until you end the call. So this is only an issue if you miss the notification.  I feel like if your motion settings are set on high it should record longer.\\n\\nI emailed Ring support on this issue when they sent me a survey for their product after I had had it a while.  They got back to me right away and were grear. They didn't say if the 30 sec. would ever be extended but they did seem to appreciate my feedback.\\n\\nI would highly recommend Ring if you are considering a video doorbell.","[]","B00N2ZDXW2","B00N2ZDXW2","AF6L2IVPT35AI6OTVU6DNH4SSXYQ","2017-03-24 22:06:17.000","0","False","504"
"254643","5","Provides great protection for larger laptops and other electronics. Design has changed some but worth the extra $$$","I bought my first one of these 10 yrs ago and only now needed to replace it, but only after I've lugged it all over, packed with the technology I need for my work. The only reason I had to replace it was I blew out the zipper on the top mini pouch I use so frequently.\\n\\nThese are fantastic backpacks and solid state. Protects your laptop and everything else therein. Many different enclosures for whatever you need, and also nice additions like protection and cable mgt for phone/audio devices and the like.\\n\\nI have typically used these with 17&#34;+ Gaming laptops and it's awesome, but would work equally well for smaller machines.\\n\\nProvides great protection as I have dropped mine on more than one occasion packed with electronics and no issues whatsoever.\\n\\nNOTES ON THIS NEW MODEL. Couple of things I don't like about the current version but I can live with:\\n1. My original one had an actual plastic clip lock that held my laptops super securely in the padded section but they have dumped that for velcro. With the old version you could throw the thing down some stairs with the laptop pouch unzipped and not have to worry about it flying out. I suspect this new design may not perform as well (thankfully you generally aren't letting it tumble like that but honestly did happen to me once on an escalator while traveling).\\n2. The internal lining is now some sort of nylon material that is really noisy. Like crunchy noisy. If you dig in there in a quiet place People might 'shhhh!' you like you are opening a big bag of chips or candy wrapper. Again, not a huge deal, but that is a very real use case where you need to retrieve something during a meeting/talk/whatever and you don't want to draw attention from the subject matter at hand.\\n3. Does still seem to be the solid state quality of the last one. I will update here if I find otherwise.\\n\\nMain take away is no matter how much convincing you have to do with your Boss/Wife/Self that it's worth paying so much for a backpack I can tell you for a fact that it is. Again, I abused the crap out of my last one and it gave me an excellent experience over the 10 yrs I had it.","[]","B000VOC90Y","B0B4BMHPJ2","AE3U4NCDBIU5MSYRMS2RPYLYKVBQ","2017-10-27 05:24:02.391","32","True","504"

They just flat out stopped working; wouldn't even charge.  Very disappointed.  I still give them 2 stars for their quick and responsive customer service - I asked for a refund and they gave it to me without question, offering their apologies.  I had the refund within 24 hrs, so I'll be trying a different brand soon.\\n===========================================\\n8/13/17 update:  Upgraded from 2 stars to 4 stars.  After contacting Phaiser via an email through their website, I described my issues below and included the order info from Amazon.  They responded within the stated 48 hrs, and immediately offered a free replacement which arrived in 2 days.  I've already used the new earbuds twice with no issues.\\n===========================================\\n\\nOriginal review (8/5/17): I got these headphones as a Christmas gift 7 months ago.  I have used them 3-4 times per week for workouts that last 45-60 min each, connecting to my iPod Nano that is strapped to my arm (i.e. very close proximity for connecting). I would say my sweat level is average to slightly above average.  Over this time, several issues have developed.\\n1) The battery life has continually gotten shorter.  When new, they held for 4-5 hrs, but now I can barely get 2 hrs.  Also, when I am charging the headphones, the LED light no longer comes on.\\n2) This week have started having trouble with the control switch.  The switch was not responsive to pressing any of the buttons - pressing the volume buttons resulted in &#34;Battery Medium&#34; statement by the pre-programmed voice but no change in volume.  And I could not turn it off (supposed to hold the middle button for 5 sec and then you get a &#34;Power Off&#34; message, but that never happened even after holding the button for 10 sec.\\n3) At times I get a lot of static through the headphones, despite the close proximity of my iPod.\\n\\nOtherwise the headphones have pretty good sound.  I'm going to contact the Manufacturer to see if they'll make good on their sweat proof guarantee.","[]","B01GDIUA8Y","B01GDIUA8Y","AHNPBQU6CCBR25N5HFKRPGKCA55Q","2017-08-05 12:15:07.359","1","True","504"
"939632","3","Caveat emptor","The video quality and the microphone quality on the cameras are good.  Setup of the Security 3.0 OPU and cameras was OK.  The app functions well.  It appears to be necessary for the mobile phone to be connected to WiFi to see the video remotely.  The documentation is fraudulent.  It says it is possible to have two-way communication via the Twist HD cameras, with both speaker and microphone active simultaneously.  That is NOT true. That may not matter too much, because the sound on the camera is unintelligible to the person standing in front of the camera.  The person holding the remote mobile phone can hear the person in front of the camera well, but cannot respond.  The chat support person I communicated with acknowledged that home8 personnel know of the audio problems of the Twist HD camera.  They continue to market them as capable of audio, and they are not.  Documentation demonstrates reassigning the camera from the OPU's 2.4GHz WiFi network to another 2.4GHz network.  That is NOT true.  The cameras see only their own OPU 2.4 GHz network.  My dual band WiFi router and the OPU are next to each other.  According to the home8 app, the 5GHz signal of my router is stronger than the OPU's, which leads me to want to switch the cameras to the 2.4GHz band on my router, because they cannot connect to 5GHz.  But the cameras see only the 5GHz on my router, and their proprietary 2.4GHz network from their own OPU.  So again, documentation is fraudulent. Purchasers also should know that although the cameras can accept &#34;up to 64GB&#34; microSD cards, Windows cannot reformat a 64GB card from native exFAT to the required FAT32 format.  That requires online search and downloading of an app that will format the card for these cameras.  I am stuck in a timing situation that likely will prevent my return of this product and replacement with a better product in time to meet a deadline.  After 2 1/2 days of reading online, it appears to me that this industry is very immature, and there are no completely reliable products in this industry.  I probably will keep this setup.  The video recording is good, and the app appears to work well remotely, as long as the mobile phone is connected to WiFi.

"736155","4","Good Cover fits Models A 1822 & A 1823.","I am pleased with this purchase. It fits perfectly (more on this below) and does the job.  Considering the price it is definitely a great value. The only negative is the built-in folding stand is a little flimsy and I can see it breaking at some point. Also the stand only works in the landscape position. With respect to sizing, the description is correct as far as it goes, it fits a 2017 9.7 inch iPad whatever that means. I learned the hard way that to be sure of the fit you need to do some serious research into the Kafkaesque manner that Apple names its iPad models. For example the iPad that this cover fits is referred to by Apple as simply the &#34;9.7 inch iPad&#34; or the &#34;iPad released Early in 2017&#34;, or the &#34;iPad 5th Generation&#34; (which if you where counting in the real world the 5th Generation was really the iPad Air).  It's official model number in the specs is &#34;iPad6, 12&#34;, &#34;EMC 3108&#34; and &#34;A 1823&#34;. (Yes 3 discrete model numbers referring to the same model). There are also Order Numbers like &#34;MP2E2LL/A&#34; which varies, in no predictable way, to identity color and storage size. (Do you get the feeling that the company that thinks every detail through is deliberately trying to make it difficult to compare models?) The A-1823 identifier however is something you can hang your hat on as it is printed on the back. (A 1822 for wifi only - same external dimensions). So to be really helpful the if the description of the models this cover fits includes references to model numbers as indicated on the back of the iPad; A 1822 & A 1823.  Also the actual external dimensions should be included: 9.4&#34; x 6.9&#34; x 0.29&#34;. (This also happens to be the same dimensions of the iPad Air, although I don't know if the all the access slots for the controls are the same. Obviously I've lost my mind researching this and if you are a masochist too you can treat yourself to the endless fun to be found at EveryiPad.com).","[]","B06XWXTBFJ","B07V5DDC7R","AF3XGH5DAP5PDDOE2CBB7JZG3KOA","2017-08-25 22:54:25.775","54","True","504"
"436173","5","Good quality at a fair price, well-constructed, easy to install","Well-crafted product in the very useful Decora form factor, which means it can be combined with other Decora plates in a complex installation. I wasn't especially impressed with the binding posts, which are of medium-quality, at best (but, in all fairness, are neither better nor worse than what you'll get elsewhere), but they are binding posts, and that's a good thing because they accept banana plugs, spade lugs, or bare wire (where some other plates only use banana plugs, which are convenient but can also be pulled out and tend to lose their &#34;spring&#34; over time)..\\n\\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, this wall plate comes with the binding posts sort of randomly inserted into their little hexagonal holes, which makes the orientation of the holes that you can insert wires into random, as well, which makes it a bit awkward to connect bare wires (which is the best way to connect wires, in my experience, especially in the back of the unit where it goes into the wall). However, this is easily remedied by taking the retaining nuts off the back of the binding posts (a pair of pliers does the trick), rotating the binding posts until the holes in them are favorably aligned, and then re-attaching the retaining nuts.\\n\\nThat done, these are great accessories for a top-notch installation, and help considerably with wire management. (While you're taking it apart to &#34;customize&#34; it, you might also want to paint it, as I did, to match wherever you're installing it. Why they don't offer this accessory in more colors is beyond me.) A pleasant surprise is the low-voltage in-wall box that comes with this unit. It truly is one of the best that I have ever seen, and might be the best part of the bargain (if you need it; I didn't because I had already put in a double-gang low-voltage box. However, I am saving it for a future use because it is truly top-notch.)  There's even a Decora trim plate to finish the installation (again, unneeded in my case, but I put it on the lilght switch in my garage, which needed a new one anyway).  Overall, a 5-star value that I would recommend to a friend and purchase again myself if I needed one!","[]","B01IQ3M46U","B01IQ3M46U","AFDLAI3HBPXZTCPFFF5VLVKPMEEA","2017-07-11 18:22:31.109","3","True","504"

"812654","5","Perfect for a custom gaming headset (with a little work)","These headphones are insanely comfortable and offer a great audio experience.  I bought them mainly for PC gaming and I wanted something that was light and comfortable on the head.\\nWhile I know nothing about audio- I did a little bit of research about gaming headsets and found out that it is better to &#34;build your own&#34; headset rather than buy a branded headset/mic combo.  This was a great pick (I bought them used-like new and saved about $60, best decision I made).\\n\\nTo convert these into a gaming headset you simply need to buy a BoomMic such as this: [[ASIN:B00BJ17WKK V-MODA BoomPro Gaming, VoIP Headset Headphone with Mic (Black)]] and a 3.5mm Female to 2.5mm Male adapter such as this: [[ASIN:B00XOE9CHG UCEC High Quality Audio Adapter Plug - 2.5mm Male to 3.5mm Female]]\\n\\nThis worked perfectly but you must first know that the Sennheiser's do not initially fit the V-Moda right away. They have a twisting lock plastic piece located inside of the earcup that has to be removed before the adapter will fit. The removal is easy, just take off the ear pads of the Sennheiser, unscrew the ear cup, then remove the 4 tiny screws holding in the twist-lock plastic piece. Once the twist-lock is removed, you can easily fit the adapter into the Sennheiser's cable hole, thereby making a custom gaming headset with the V-Moda BoomPro. Took me all of 10 minutes and the quality is insanely better than any gaming headset could provide.\\n\\nThe only con I have is sometimes the open ear cup feature with these headphones detracts from the audio experience if there is noise in and around you when you are using them.  I, for example have a dishwasher close by that when it is running definitely seeps through the headphones and detracts from the gaming audio.  It's nothing major but it is something to consider.  I would either turn the volume up a little bit more, or only use them in an area where there will not be much outside noise interference. I did however know this going into the purchase and still am giving these headphones a 5 star because they are amazing!!!","[]","B004FEEY9A","B00WSLWRAA","AFU7RTGP4UAOFFIXPQFNG7OP2NUQ","2017-08-25 17:07:42.895","2","True","504"
"571698","5","Flawless...and better performance than I expected.","I have a 1,300 Sq. Ft. ranch style house.  I placed one Velop in the corner of my basement and the entire house is getting a full signal on the upper level.  My speed from ISP is rated at 75Mbs and the Velop is providing 90 Mbs throughout my upper living areas.  My basement is Unfinished, so I'm sure it helps getting the great speed and range.  I have 3/4&#34; plywood subfloor and 3/4&#34; hardwood flooring.  The signal is easily passing through 1-1/2&#34; of lumber between the basement and the living space above.\\n\\nI downloaded the App and installed the device as directed (step-by-step).  I used my smartphone to operate the App.  I turned on both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios of my smartphone prior to installation.  Setup was very easy.  Give the Velop several minutes to &#34;communicate&#34; and setup.  After installation completed, Velop asked for permission to update itself.  I approved the command, but no updates were required at the time.\\n\\nThis is not a cheap system to install, but it was worth every penny.  I saved time, frustration and effort because I purchased this unit.  I have a great mesh network I can add onto anytime without network signal loss if necessary in the future (add a node in my detached garage).  The Velop unit is solid construction and easy on the eyes.  No &#34;bright lights&#34; to keep you awake at night if you place this in a bedroom.  A soft purple LED glow illuminates from the top of the unit to let you know it's connected and working properly.\\n\\nYou can add a guest network with ease....Velop software asks you during initial setup.\\n\\nI researched many WiFi units (probably too many) before I purchased the Velop.  I think I made the right decision for my application.  My house is 100% hardwired using CAT 7 and Gigabit, but I wanted a solid Wi-Fi network for my guests.\\n\\nGood luck with your search to find the perfect Wi-Fi system.  I can recommend the Velop and suggest you give it a consideration.  I'm happy :)","[]","B01N2NLRSD","B0BSVGYKTK","AEVRF2REU7VPSVEYMIQ55RO624GQ","2017-03-02 16:00:05.000","1","True","504"

The installation was a bit difficult from the driver side, I had a helper in the passenger seat hand me items when needed which made things easier.  The worst part of the install is keeping dust from contaminating the surface while the sheet is being laid in place.  I had to do this with the car off, windows up, and doors closed, after vacuuming and leaving the car sit for an hour to let the particles of dust settle.  We even slowed our breathing for a few minutes in an attempt to not stir up any dust, really difficult in summer heat with no A/C.  I still managed to get one small dust particle trapped in the very upper corner of the top screen.\\nThese protectors are cut very close to the edges of the screens, a very tight fit.  They require precise positioning to avoid overhang and need for trimming.  After a couple weeks with these on now the bottom edge of the bottom screen protector is beginning to come up, just about 1/16 in. along the bottom edge.  We don't get extreme heat here, 95F is the top we got during the weeks after installing, but we do get high humidity.  That could be causing the issue, as when we installed the protectors the glass was clean enough to eat off of, our hands were clean, and we actively kept from touching the tack surface.\\nThe package: There are little sticker tabs included to help not touch the tack surface, they help to position the plastic.  I wish there were more than the three tho, I had to re-use them for the top after installing the bottom and by removing and re-use they had lost a little of their tackiness.  There is also a larger &#34;sticker&#34; labeled as a dust remover, it can (and was very effectively) used to remove dust and lint from the surface of the glass after cleaning with the included fingerprint remover cloth.  There is a small, thin card included that can be used to push any bubbles out, I found it much too thin and flexible for that.  A (good condition, newer) credit card worked fine.  My package had 2 of each protector sheets included.  I suppose they do this in case one gets messed up on install, but if you are careful you have another set for use in a couple years when these get scratched up.","[]","B06Y4HG18B","B06Y4HG18B","AEM5V43IG5MRVFJBSRYRUDUELSHA","2017-09-04 03:46:46.837","1","True","504"

I do have this paired with a GTX 1080 ti (water cooled).  It is great DSR 4K monitor.  I play all of my games in DSR 4K with this monitor and it is buttery smooth!  There is NO BACKLIGHT BLEED AT ALL, the black levels are extremely dark...on the other hand, there is a very very very slight bit of ghosting, it is not really noticeable...also, the HDR is not working due to a Windows driver...once they correct that it will be better I believe.  Also, I did use the DSR in mass effect andromeda and it looks really good!  I am not sure why Lim's Cave gave the review he did on this monitor....I would have to say his review was a bit biased...this monitor is definitely something you have to experience in person.

"904715","4","Interesting and Worthwhile Speakers","I've had an interesting experience with these speakers.  I bought four of them to serve as front/rear speakers in a multichannel music setup, using a 100WPC amp.  Initially I was not enthusiastic about the sound:  I noticed distortion at high volumes within certain frequencies, which I attributed to clipping.  I've also read reviews that mentioned this issue.  Oddly enough, I was able to largely mitigate the issue by swapping the speakers to different positions, which suggested I was getting cabinet vibrations.  Through various positioning tweaks I was able to improve on the sound.  I also noticed that the issue was very much source-dependent (certain recordings sounded a lot better than others).\\n\\nEverything changed when I tried two of them in a 2-channel tube amp system (with 35WPC).  The sound (particularly bass response) was, in a word, fantastic.  I listen to all kinds of music, and have an unlikely test track for speakers:  &#34;Doin' It Right&#34; by Daft Punk.  I like this one because, at exactly 0:26, there is an electronic sub-bass note that either comes through clearly or it doesn't...if you don't hear the note you need a sub, if it's distorted at high volume you know you have a vibration issue, etc.  This track will give you a window into your low bass response.  With these speakers, in this setup, the low bass response is amazingly good - clear, detailed, and &#34;natural&#34; (as natural as a synth note can sound).  I would put the bass response on these up against much, much more expensive speakers.  No sub needed for music.  And it's not just bass:  The highs and mids are nicely detailed, clear and musical.\\n\\nBottom line:\\n\\n- Positioning and isolation are important;\\n- I would stick to amps of around 30-60WPC, especially if you plan on high volumes;\\n- These speakers love tube amps!\\n\\nWith these caveats, these speakers are highly recommended:  &#34;For the price,&#34; yes...they are absurdly low-priced in the audiophile world.  But these are great speakers in general...when used in the right setting.","[]","B014GSEQ06","B014GSEQ06","AHZMMCA2DDL4RVH6FAPNKCKCPQCA","2017-08-16 17:54:51.415","5","True","504"
"485933","1","Feels pretty solid, button makes satisfying clicking noise, lights occasionally turn on. But that's it.","I purchased this to be able to use a Nintendo Wii U and a Nintendo Switch on the same HDMI port. My TV only has 2, and one is occupied by my Chromecast. This seemed cheaper than a new TV with more HDMI ports. Well, it was cheaper than a TV, I'll give it that.\\n\\nThe only indicators of status are one light per HDMI input. There's also a button labeled &#34;Select&#34; that doesn't seem to do anything. There are essentially no instructions, maybe 50 words worth. The instruction sheet does call it a &#34;Pigtail,&#34; though, which is cute. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that it's one of those it-works-or-it-doesn't sort of things that's pretty much impossible to troubleshoot. Once you've clicked the single button, you're pretty much done debugging.\\n\\nI tried everything I could think of. I spent about 30 minutes of plugging, unplugging, powering down, powering up, switching ports, pressing the little &#34;Select&#34; button. I saw the indicator lights flash red a couple of times on the HDMI switch, but that's it. For a while, I got some masochistic enjoyment out of trying to guess what it would do next, but eventually I was forced to conclude that one thing it definitely would not do is transmit a signal and display literally anything on my TV. So I think it's a dud.\\n\\nMaybe my TV is too old? But I mean, that's why we're looking at this thing in the first place, right? Your TV sucks, too.\\n\\nOr maybe I'm too dumb to follow 50 words of instructions and figure it out? But you'd think that after trying every combination I could imagine, I would have stumbled upon the proper use by chance, right? I may not be a smart man, but I am stubborn.\\n\\nSo now I'm faced with the classic cheap electronics dilemma: I have this useless thing I paid $9 for, and I have to decide whether it's worth $9 to hook my printer up, print a label, and drag myself the half mile to the post office to return it. I'm thinking no, but then there's the principle of it, right? Ugh.","[]","B06VX1PKQ7","B06VX1PKQ7","AFOVGG7DQW25KXCOUZORYJT3JR7A","2017-12-07 23:06:18.675","8","True","504"
"800673","2","and I'm not a fan of the ""look how great of a deal you're getting these are normally SO ...","Before I go into my review, I'm going to clarify something: These are listed as being on sale for $37 when they are supposedly $170 headphones. These aren't even worth $80, and I'm not a fan of the &#34;look how great of a deal you're getting these are normally SO expensive.&#34; I figured the original price would be inflamed a little bit, but not by $130. I would have considered something else had I realized this.\\n\\nFor the actual review part; I'd consider it about a 3.5 star bundle FOR $37. It comes with a car charger, a nice case, an adapter, different buds for your ears, and the actual headphones. The wireless connection is stable, the battery life is pretty long, and they fit comfortably in your ears.\\n\\nBut the most important part of my review is about the poor sound quality. Most of the music I listen to has a fair amount of bass, and it can be completely overpowering to the rest of the song with these headphones. The highs are not very sharp, and generally the sound is muffled. I can't comment on the mic but it doesn't really matter, I got these for running and will be getting a different pair for general use. These are nothing special for $37 (and it's extremely distasteful to market them as an ex-$170 pair imo). Even my $20 skullcandy wired headphones produced much better sound quality surprisingly (and I never considered them good). Also, it might just be my pair, but they need to be positioned correctly to charge. However the battery life is long enough that it doesn't bother me.\\n\\nFinally, connecting them to a different device is a hassle. I have other bluetooth devices and the only way to pair them to something else is by disabling bluetooth on the device they're currently connected to.\\n\\nThese could be great for you and the sound quality might not bother you. I make music as a hobby and have sort of developed an ear for equalizing songs, so it's possible I'm just noticing what others don't. But it's extremely noticeable to me. And just to reiterate, I'm not grading these as $37 headphones, I'm grading these as $170 headphones on sale for $37, because that's what it's listed as at the time of this review.","[]","B01G8JO5F2","B01G8JO5F2","AGYIUVFOF6ZSUNLYI6E3LXDDJPHQ","2017-05-30 19:09:03.000","2","True","504"
"646517","3","Not bad for for the price","I have work with many surveillance systems, Samsung, lorax, and arlo. To name the ones I like. I have had 3 foscam, one indoor that I had for 5 years fi8910w 2 out door cameras one died, so I don't remember the number. The one I'm using now is Fi9803p v3. I had the camera set up with e mail alerts. After a couple of months my email server would stop them because it was sending too many emails and looked at it as a virus or spam. Foscam does not give a good way to Record out of the box. I needed a solution and was looking at Arlo, but I live in the County and their night vision and Motion detection was nowhere near the foscam cameras. I stumbled across this little foscam nvr and said I have the cameras let give it a try. Well I'm on day 8 of using it and I'm very pleased. Has a lot of great features and recognized all my cameras even the 5 year old one. All surveillance systems have a learning curve this one was not bad at all I was up and running in about an hour. Did a lot of adjustments that why it took so long. I gave it a 3 out 5 for 2 reasons. The description said it came with a mouse, remote, and Ethernet cable. In box was nvr and power cable. That was it. My Other Beef was no mobile app. They have many apps for viewing live on the cameras but none for viewing the NVR. Almost every System nowadays has a Mobile app to view your videos from an iPad or iPhone. You can view from you PC or MAC with a plug-in for your browser. But not Ideal for someone on the go. I'm hoping they eventually come out with one. I'm very pleased with the other overall but I had the cameras so in the long run it was cheaper for me. If I was just starting out I would look into the one I mentioned above. All surveillance systems have the pros and cons. When It comes to IP cameras foscam is one of the best. Well-made lots of features. Their biggest  lack is their software. But if you have some of these cameras and need a nvr I say go for it. One of the biggest features I like is in the Arlo system phone notification when motion is tripped. Like I said they all have their pros and cons.","[]","B00XNOYCSQ","B00XNOYCSQ","AE6FKD4KPVMAVFHXX5BNCZ5CUE5Q","2017-02-01 15:15:43.000","0","True","504"

You HAVE to be able to write data faster than you are producing it or you're gonna lose some or all of your data.\\n\\nI initially forgot to order an SD card with my camera so I tried using a Patriot 32gb UHS U1 card I happened to have and the camera would either skip while recording because it couldn't finish writing video before more video was produced, or would stop recording entirely without any file showing on the card. Make sure to get an SD card that has UHS-I(indicated by a roman numeral I) U3(indicated by a 3 shown within a U) or one with that reads V30 on the card, which guarantees at least 30 MB per second sustained write speeds.\\n\\nNow onto the camera itself:\\n\\nPros:\\n-Small, lightweight form factor is perfect for chest/head mounting and mounting in spaces with limited clearance\\n-Waterproof without a case(not tested, probably never will)\\n-Image quality is good with adequate lighting\\n-For a device this small, battery life is actually ok but will vary depending on settings\\n-Cheap at around ~$175 at time of purchase\\n-Charges off of an ordinary micro usb cable\\n\\nCons:\\n-Very slow to respond to a button press for recording if done immediately after ending another recording, likely because it is\\nstill trying to finalize the last video file\\n-Have to use the Android/iOS app(Capture) in order to preview and control certain settings\\n-Android app connects to the camera via WiFi and will disconnect your phone from any WiFi networks\\n-Android app takes a while to connect and occasionally fails to connect\\n-Switching away from the Android app and then back requires it to reconnect\\n-Enabling advanced camera settings(protune) through the app disables the ability to change certain settings such as angle(medium or wide) both on the app and on the camera with the built in buttons and lcd screen.","[]","B01C80O0ZU","B07FKKHH16","AHYNPKULBIPP3DZFDQMSYPQB3GPA","2017-04-09 04:10:47.000","12","True","504"

The problem is the power supply combined with the company, Insteon.  Out of the 5 cameras I have had 4 power supplies go bad - all located on different power systems and all went out at different times but all within the same time frame of usage.  This would not be a problem except when combined with Insteon.  Insteon has had about 20 emails from me asking how I can replace these power supplies.  I did NOT ask for THEM to replace them; I said I was totally willing to pay for the replacements but needed to find where I could get them or if I could get them through them.  NOTHING!  NO RESPONSE!  I had been in contact with the company when the cameras started dying so I went back to them.  They only wanted to talk to me if I had purchased the cameras within a 3 month time frame.  When I said I was not interested in warranty work but in how I could buy power supplies - last I heard from them!  Nothing.  No more response!\\n\\nOne - I would be suspect the company knows they have bad power supplies AND there may be possible safety hazards related to them - it would explain why they dropped off the radar the moment I said I troubleshot the problem to the power supplies themselves!  Now I have 4 dead cameras and 1 good that I have concerns about with fire safety.  However, the newest camera has a totally different power head than the other cameras so I am going to continue to use it as long as I don't detect heating issues or any power surging.\\n\\nTwo - the power is surging when put on a tester.  it is the same power as a USB outlet so I don't understand how they could have screwed this up as badly.\\n\\nThird - not responding to customer inquiries when it comes to their product failure is, to me, unacceptable.  There are other Insteon devices I would love to purchase but all purchases from this company are on hold.\\n\\nFourth - I have also had a problem with their HUB which died right out of warranty.  It was, again, a model that was updated and I have not had a problem with the newer version.

"164769","1","No way to turn off ""soap opera effect"" (motion smoothing)","I had problems with both the delivery and the product itself.\\nPRODUCT: If you're one of those people who doesn't like the &#34;soap opera&#34; effect of newer TVs (motion smoothing), note that you cannot turn it off on this TV. Even when you go into the motion smoothing settings and select 'OFF,' there's still lots of motion smoothing. For some people, that's not a problem or even desirable. For me, it makes the TV completely unwatchable. I didn't see anything about that in the the product description or in the manual that came with the TV. Online I was able to find a CNET review that said that they had to call Sony to find out the native refresh rate for their 4K TVs, and the answer they got is 120hz (= soap opera effect). It's baked in. If you don't like the soap opera effect, this is not the TV for you and your eyes will bleed. Look for a TV that either has or lets you select a refresh rate of 60hz.\\nDELIVERY: This was delivered several days late, even though I had paid for next day shipping and waited around the whole day that it was supposed to be delivered. The outside box was in bad shape when it got here, and I hope it holds up for the return. Even though amazon's tracking software finally updated itself to tell me that the delivery window had turned into 4 days and now shows the day it was actually delivered, that did not automatically trigger a refund of the next-day shipping fee. I guess I have to ask for it. Disappointing.\\nGOOGLE JUNK: Sony did a deal with Google, so the home screen is cluttered with a gazillion Google apps that most people will probably never use. Not a reason in itself to return it, but it's annoying. I didn't see a way to delete them or remove them from the Home screen.\\nREMOTE: Even though in theory you can sync the Sony remote to control your set-top cable box, in reality there are no separate buttons to select TV vs. Cable on the remote (e.g. do you want the TV menu or the Cable menu) so you're likely not going to get the menu or controls you're actually looking for and will still end up using multiple remotes, or using a different remote as the universal.","[]","B01MUG21R7","B01MUG21R7","AEJCAZ6PROP6VOVXVTZLQ5U7WNRA","2017-06-28 14:31:28.881","31","True","504"

Unfortunately it falls flat in a couple categories.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Cheap\\n- Small (portable)\\n- Connects to all your other amazon apps easily, and it's integrated into your amazon account so ordering things is easy\\n- You can send apps to it remotely by logging into amazon, selecting the app, and commanding it to download on your device\\n- Uses Alexa\\n- Very easy to just plug into a computer and toss a couple movie files onto it\\n- Integrated storage PLUS an extra slot for adding a micro-SD card\\n- VLC app is available to play your stored movies/shows\\n\\nCons:\\n- &#34;Light Bleeding&#34; is getting pretty bad on a couple edges of the screen.\\n- A couple of dead pixels have popped up\\n- Lock screen by default has advertisements that you have to PAY (like $15) to get rid of. Until then you cannot customize your lock screen\\n- Many of the apps that you are used to having on your phone, here are not full fledged, for example youtube is effectively a mobile browser version of the app and is missing many features of a full-fledged youtube app. There is no other web-browser options that are practical either\\n- You can not use this device if you do not have an amazon account. If you give this device to a child I think there's like parental controls to make sure they don't go on a shopping spree but still, the requirement is a little ridiculous\\n- Integrated speakers are very quiet\\n- Screen size is tiny\\n\\nConclusion: Yes this is a very cheap tablet and if you think you would only need it for basic applications then sure, maybe this is for you. For me the cons out-weighed the pros, and I had to buy an upgrade. If you're on the fence about this, my advice is to save your money and be willing to spend a little bit more and get a REAL tablet. Kinda sad that I wasted money on this, and the amazon account requirement makes gifting this or selling this difficult....","[]","B01ACEKAJY","B01BRWH8G8","AG7ZYE47EVTQOEPTHGYDDX73LEVA","2017-02-27 17:57:24.000","1","True","504"

"811604","4","Good product - especially for the price, but may be frustrating to get working.","The replay system is supposed to be an easy to use system, and it is once you get everything in a good state, though that part was very frustrating. Here is a tip, for people that have issues like I did. I opened the app and added using the &#34;Smart Device&#34; feature. The app found my replay NVR and both of my cameras. The app then prompted me to update the firmware on both of my cameras (which is where the trouble began). After the cameras updated, I could no longer view the video through the NVR. I deleted all the devices and started over, this time the two cameras weren't found when adding the smart device. I looked at the NVR in the app and it did not show an update for the firmware (thinking that may have been the issue). I could add the cameras separately, but they did not appear to be linked to the NVR. I talked to a few people at support and it was hit or miss on getting someone that seemed to have good technical knowledge of the devices and mostly referred me to the pdf docs that I had already read. I finally got someone that suggested plugging the NVR in to HDMI. The NVR has it's own little computer system in it and after navigating to device settings using a usb mouse plugged in the back, I was able to update the firmware on the NVR (even though the app didn't seem to know it needed it). Turns out the newer version of the firmware uses encryption for the video, so by updating the cameras, they were no longer able to talk to each other. Once I updated through the NVR's menus, all my cameras connected automatically including my zmodo 720p pan and tilt camera. Mine does not seem to record audio however, so I will be contacting again to get that resolved. Also, the two way audio on the cameras is really really quiet, to the point that I'm not sure that it's really useful. (Update Jan 5 2018) - System is still running great, the nvr is a must have and marks all moments of interest on the timeline for playback. The motion alerts are great and the system has run perfectly since getting it going. Also, the two way audio was quiet while testing, but I think it's because the microphone was in the same room. I've used this remotely and the person at the other end said the audio was loud enough and clear enough to hear me fine.)","[]","B01KZT6IVK","B01KZT6IVK","AGX3355GWOI4IWQBVX2EK7FX6QIA","2017-12-13 18:28:20.446","2","True","504"
"344478","3","They work okay.","Pros:\\n  - They do the job.  No more dealing with finding a place to put the lens cap; it's hanging out right there.\\n  - They are inexpensive.\\n  - They have both an inside and outside circumference pinch option.  My OEM Canon ones only can be pinched from outside the circumference.\\n\\nCons:\\n  - I'm not fond of the approach of using an adhesive button to attach the tether to the cap.\\n  - The inside pinch point could stand to be a little easier to grip.  They're workable, but it is easy to slip.  If they were a littles less shallow, or if there were a little more friction on the pinch tabs it would be perfect.\\n\\nI'm giving 3 stars because they are okay.  I don't consider price in rating, because everyone has their own idea about what's worth it or not.  But if I did consider it in the star rating, I would bump them up because (I think) they are so reasonable.  Likewise, if I review a product that oozes excellence on every level and exceeds all expectations, but is also relatively expensive, I won't knock any stars off either.  I review products, not prices.  Besides, prices can go up or down with time.\\n\\nOkay, I made a modification to the tether attachment method.  I took the following steps with each cap:\\n  - Cut off and discarded the adhesive backed &#34;button.&#34;\\n  - Drilled a small hole on the bottom edge of the cap just large enough for the leash cord to pass through.\\n  - Passed the end of the leash through the hole, from the outside going in.\\n  - Tied a knot on the leash end so that it could not slip back out of the cap.\\n  - Used a butane soldering iron/heat wand to melt the frayed end of the leash to prevent it from unraveling over time.\\n\\nAs of yet I haven't done anything to improve the grip of the inner pinch surfaces.  I might cut a couple of small strips of rubber and glue them on sometime; if I ever muster up the gumption.  I'm getting by so far without it being necessary, but it would be nicer.","[]","B00G97ALA2","B00G97ALA2","AHPBQ3Z363UT57KVFVDLO27RHUPA","2017-02-17 19:45:42.000","2","True","504"
"394302","3","Bought it on a Promo but the Quality just isn't there anymore!","We bought these on a promotion buy 2 save 15% off each. We bought these very cheap for our 4 year old and 7 year old for when we were traveling. In order for us to charge them we have to use our Samsung Galaxy chargers because the ones Amazon provided do not fit comfortably inside of the port and wiggle around. Therefore one little vibration from a truck going by our house can cause the entire thing to stop charging which is happened on numerous occasions. This thing is so cheap yet is loaded with a lot of content that shouldn't even be on there and takes up way too much memory. While we enjoy the free time app we also would like to have access to Google Play. So hubby had to root it to put Google Play on there so the kids could watch YouTube kids. Since we only paid around $50 per tablet I really don't care if it doesn't work in a year from now. However my children are used to playing on Galaxy tablets that are mine and my husband's, therefore they have been disappointed by the battery life which doesn't even last a plane ride from Newark to Disney nor the varieties of apps that are not available to them when they are not on free time on Wi-Fi. Again we got this very cheap and therefore the expectations were low after all their warranty is awful. This is our third Kindle Fire as we've had one since the first generation.  Since then the quality has gone down significantly since their first generation try. Good luck to all the parents that want to purchase this for their children. Please expect to have alternatives for them to play with if you plan on using this on an airplane or on a long car ride. Also,  make sure that you get the expandable memory card because they have so much bloatware on this device that it takes up 90% of the memory on a 16 gigabyte. If you decide not to, you will be constantly deleting or as they call it &#34;Manage Archive&#34; on the device.  The free time app is very good. We enjoy the books and variety of age appropriate apps for each child on there, but again you can't get Google Play unless you download a specific link, which you can find that information online. We did purchase the Extended Warranty on these, since the warranty is so weak. A lot of other reviewers suggested it for when it dies after 6 months to a years world of use. This will be our last Kindle purchase.","[]","B018Y22BI4","B010BWYDYA","AGY3SUOHBYKM3UPNXTOYFITACDAQ","2017-04-10 11:50:54.000","1","True","504"
"778495","3","Great device, but mine is defective","I want to love this camera, but the one I received seems to have some issues. I previously owned the original GoPro, and then the Hero 3+, and have always been a fan of these cameras, even as cheaper knock offs have come about.\\n\\nLoved my Hero 3+, but had some scares with water occasionally leaking through the case and getting on the device. I also didn't love the fact that I either had to purchase the LCD screen separately or connect with my phone to ensure the video I was shooting looked as expected. For these reasons I was super excited to hear about the Hero 5 and the fact that it was both waterproof without a case, and had an LCD touchscreen built in.\\n\\nAnd, it is pretty awesome. I still purchased the dive housing which I still use anytime I'm getting near water, but like that I don't have to stress too much about water leaks. Also love the ability to instantly review footage I've collected and easily change settings from the built in touch screen.\\n\\nSome issues:\\nRight away I noticed that I would get some occasional &#34;glitches&#34; when recording video. At random points in my videos, there will be VERY brief flashes of purple/distorted video. I thought at first that this might have been due to the SD card I was using (even though it's one of the ones listed on GoPro's site), but this still persisted even after changing to a different card. Also doesn't seem to matter what quality I record at.\\n\\n99.99% of the video looks great, but having to edit out these random glitches in the middle of a cool shot is pretty annoying. Recently, these glitches now started appearing at the very beginning of every video I record.\\n\\nNow after just updating the firmware, I've had the GoPro randomly turn on and take 30 burst shots out of no where. This has happened twice in the last two days. Both times were after interacting with the device a few minutes earlier, but in both cases the device was definitely off. My guess is that it isn't fully turning off and thinks it picked up a voice command, since both times it happened while I was speaking.\\n\\nGoing to attempt a warranty replacement. I want to give this 5 stars...but have to knock off 2 just for the headache of getting a seemingly defective unit.","[]","B01MT0TJOM","B01MT0TJOM","AFBR3HXWTC2K75YE5SA2HPNLH76Q","2017-06-29 01:45:07.160","9","True","504"
"156208","4","Not so disappointed now","I really wanted to like this, but it's going back.  Out of the box, it's nice looking and seems fairly sturdy.  Setup was a breeze -- less than 10 minutes even though I first forgot to power it on.  Doh.  Straighforward, not confusing at all, no real technical know-how needed.\\n\\nThe first day, it worked really well, although motion detection lags a bit.  The picture is sharp and clear, good definition even on low def.  It has a pretty wide angle, so you get a good view of the room even when stationary.  One of the reasons I chose this camera was its 360 degree rotation though.\\n\\nTonight, I placed it near a doorway so it can see into the kitchen to the back door and through the dining and living rooms to the front door.  Just what I wanted.  But testing it, I rotated it almost 360 degrees.  And it got stuck.  Had to unplug and reset it.  Now it pans much slower than it had been.\\n\\nAlso, in the last 2 hours, it's been dropping the connection and reconnecting, and dropping again.  And all the videos it's taken when it detects motion have playback errors.\\n\\nWhile I really want to like it, it's too unreliable so far.\\n\\nUPDATE:  FOUR AND A HALF STARS.  After a frustrating period of this going offline, it's finally staying connected.  If it drops offline it IS a hassle getting it going again, but finally worth the effort.\\n\\nI bought it mainly as a pet cam and it's great for that.  It has better resolution and better viewing area than any cam I've tried.  I don't think the motion detection works very well and is pretty spotty.\\n\\n Would I recommend it and buy it again?  Absolutely.  I have it on a table where I can turn it to the back door, then pan thru the kitchen, dining room, and living room to the front door, effectively covering a large part of my main floor.  My pets often hang out in the kitchen or dining room so I can log on and check on them, or talk to them if I want.\\n\\nOverall I'm pretty happy with it and would definitely buy again.","[]","B01A52KLTC","B01A52KLTC","AGTIGEKGKHDIWT3M5ZWPQSZWPDDA","2017-03-20 05:20:58.000","1","True","504"
"909109","5","sleek and stylish","Sleek, stylish, and works as expected. The image quality is good enough for capturing accident details, and I really like the &#34;set it and forget it&#34; design of the system. I had the system professionally installed, which I would recommend if you can spare the buck fifty or so it costs, because a professional installation under the car panels makes the system look really clean, like a factory option almost.\\n\\nI did have one disappointment, although I don't really hold the camera responsible for it. I recently took a road trip and passed thru a crazy lightning storm one night. I was hoping the camera would catch all of the lightning strikes and make some cool footage, but the night view mode of the camera was just washed out by the lightning as the camera wasn't fast enough to transition to the sudden light. But that isn't really what the camera is for so I won't penalize my review of it for that.\\n\\nOne note: I generally use my dash-cam for capturing accident details, but some people are apparently using the system to record things like traffic stops. If you expect to record interactions in or around the car, like with a police officer, I would recommend that you turn the optional microphone off. Legal opinion varies (and I'm no lawyer, so take this with a grain of salt), but generally most states are fine with you recording audio if you notify people who might be caught on audio. But rather than upset some local law enforcement officer who may get angry and demand you turn the system off, I would suggest just bypassing the whole wiretapping angle by turning the audio off. With the audio off you aren't required to notify anyone that the system is running, so if you are looking to document something like a traffic stop you can do so without having to assert your right to record, which usually just ticks people off. Still, this is just my opinion, and it's not an expert one.\\n\\nBottom line, there are some more technologically advanced dash-cams on the market now than the Blackvue, but in my opinion none of them blend as nicely into a mid to high end vehicle as this system while providing the kind of dependable operation the Blackvue offers. The small, unobtrusive size and smooth cylinder design look right at home in nicer cars (and my mid-range Toyota :) ). i'm very happy with my purchase.","[]","B01H7WJIYC","B01H7WJIYC","AH3K4J5ADOB6DJXHKZ2YIFBBBKOA","2017-03-11 21:10:51.000","5","True","504"
"90676","4","Good solution, with limitations.","Accomplishes the goal that it sets out to accomplish.  However, the buttons are a little limited.  If you have only a TV to turn on, than this does just fine.  If you have a second component, such as a speaker system, you can make this work, but chances are you will still need a universal remote to tweak some settings.  If you have a third device (such as a BluRay player), you can program this to turn it on, but that's about it.  I understand that this is not intended to be a full replacement for a universal remote--it's just intended to be able to turn your TV off and on when watching the Amazon Fire (or other streaming device). However, it would be handy to have more buttons to program for the TV, for example, having full TV &#34;navigation&#34; buttons (i.e. up, down, left, right, and select).  Sometimes I want to tweak my display settings for watching a movie depending on the time of day or light level.  If I had those buttons I could accomplish that without getting the old universal remote control out.\\n\\nI tried using a universal remote with a Flirc to control the Amazon Fire, and this worked reasonably well.  This kept me at a single remote, but the concessions were: 1) no voice search, and 2) no &#34;long press&#34; support (some Fire buttons behave differently with a long press versus a single click).  After living with these shortcomings a while, I decided to try the SideClick.  I'm glad I did, this is what I use to watch the Fire. I now have voice search and long press functionality back.  However, the downside, is I have to keep my second universal remote control handy to control the BluRay player, or change any display settings on the TV.  With the number of buttons available, the added functions I have are 1) turn all devices (TV, Speaker, BluRay) on/off, 2) volume up/down, 3) &#34;ok&#34; and &#34;Exit&#34; commands on the TV--which are useless since there's no arrow or navigation buttons, and 4) a TV input toggle.  So I can't quite get rid of the second universal remote with this. Maybe the next version will have more buttons.","[]","B01MRFY61G","B07LD9TTZY","AEKBKBN4LU6KQLONWV72XHFUFIGQ","2017-09-25 18:20:22.337","3","True","504"

"374130","4","It installs easily and works as desired.","I installed this product inside my garage. What I like about the product is the compact size which gives me flexibility where to mount it. The product arrived in only 2 days, and the price was fantastic. The seller contacted me to assure they wanted to provide as much support as necessary to make this a positive experience. I also have an existing horizontal &#34;christmas tree shape&#34; type that this product is replacing, so my comments are a pretty accurate comparison of the two (existing antenna is spec'd for 100 miles). I'd give this product 5 stars if the quality of the rotator and of the amplifier were tops (more on this later). [Put another $5 into the rotator and another $5 into the amplifier. Raise the price to recover the increased costs; and this would be one fantastic product and very competitive with the more-typical antenna/amplifier combination.]\\n\\nINSTALLATION = pretty straightforward. The instructions are pretty basic and should have a bit more detail of the electrical connections. This antenna has to mount in an attic or in a garage. It would never survive outdoors (at least not in Minnesota).\\nPERFORMANCE = My existing antenna delivered 23 clear channels without an amplifier and 31 channels with a CM7777 amplifier. This antenna delivered 5 channels without an amplifier and the same 31 channels with its amplifier, so this antenna clearly needs its amplifier. An upside is you'll know the amplifier died when you only get a few channels.\\nROTATOR = weird and has a mind of its own. May move CW or may move CCW. I think it wants to rotate the right way but reverses direction when it bangs into the load. There's so much backlash in the system that the motor starts without load, then engages the load, and then reverses. The remote is IR line of sight, so its use is limited. However, you don't have to climb a ladder to adjust it. And for me, I only have to adjust it once, which I did after a little effort.\\nAMPLIFIER = didn't give me any confidence after I opened it up. The assembly is definitely hand labor in a garage environment. The amplifier is what makes this product work. I'm assuming the quality of the assembly is representative of the quality of the components. The design may be fantastic, but there is more to a quality product than just the design.","[]","B017JEF126","B017JEF126","AHBWT2IN4DOGV6GMZ7V5PR5CWEQA","2017-05-09 20:53:28.000","5","True","504"

I needed this extra light to work in the dark.\\n\\nBattery:\\nI had it for a little time only but so far so good. It doesn’t take too much time to charge (I don’t know if it was fully depleted when I first charged it). If the dongle isn’t connected and if they keyboard is on, it won’t stay up more than a couple of seconds so there is no risk leaving it on all the time. When the dongle is connected to something (PS4, computer…) it will automatically turn off after 3 minutes, to save the battery.

"916658","5","Astounding.","Purchased one for my daughter. Loved it so much, I had to have one of my own. In fact, I needed for my computers and phones because my 20+ year old hodgepodge of mismatched components finally gave up the ghost. Before settling on this Bluetooth speaker, I tried out a least a dozen of the more recognizable competitors. ( I won't mention their names but they're all in the $200-250 range. )  This little box, no bigger than Fred Flintstone's lunch box, blew me out of my boots. It's all there : deep, punchy bass...the way everybody seems to like it these days...the mid-range is clear, front and center. The high ends sparkle but there is nothing &#34;tinny&#34; about the treble.  The unit sounds fabulous and it'll get mighty loud on you, especially in the smaller spaces for which it was designed. I have no idea how the designers of this speaker pulled it off, none whatsoever.  It's audio wizardry...and that's a compliment from a lifelong audiophile. Comes with a dull vinyl case and the charger that Archeer reccomends must be purchased separately. Or not...I have no problem charging it with the same hardware I use for my iPhone and iPad. It charges slowly but that power lasts a long time. ( The recommended Archeer charger is much faster and it's worth the few extra bucks. )  No problems at all with Bluetooth pairing. How good is this speaker? I fired her up and my neighbor paid me a compliment on the great sound. And, yes, it is stereo unlike a lot of other simarly priced units that trick you into buying a mono loudspeaker.  The Archeer's nice wood and fabric finish complete the package: it looks great. You won't be hiding it behind a chair. One, tiny caution : (Archeer, are you listening?) No grill covers to protect fragile speaker cones. I handle my audio stuff like a surgeon working on someone's brain but a lot of users are hard on their equipment. The unit is portable but be careful when you break it out at a party because EVERYONE wants to touch it. Saved the very best for last : you will not find this much sound and fury for $65.00 anywhere else. Simple, elegant, thrifty, with surprisingly great sound. Well done, Archeer.","[]","B01HLSMVTQ","B01HLSMVTQ","AFO4OR3V3KOSPYJKGTZSHZPXYXYA","2017-07-13 00:24:22.509","4","True","504"
"771055","3","Look elsewhere for it cheaper then it’s a good value","Bought on Groupon for $64. So don’t spend three times that here. Overall, you get a bit more than you pay for at $64, however, at close to $200. I would get something else. Bluetooth sound quality is horrible for streaming music. Makes a crackling sound that’s not present with radio or hard wire or steaming from Spotify app. Down side is the WiFi antenna is so poor that when my phone is sitting on the seat in front of head unit, it’s not at full strength. It has to connected to internet via WiFI or tethering to use Google maps unless you download them offline. Which is easy to do if you just tether to your phone for a day of driving.  Same holds true for Spotify, unless your music is downloaded, you have to be on a hotspot. I find I end up plugging my phone in via the USB to charge it while the hotspot is active. Not ideal. The screen has also somehow been getting scratched as it retracts and opens and it’s not dirty and looks like there should be enough clearance. The front faceplate that pops off is flimsy. And I have yet to get my backup camera working. Switches fine but the camera doesn’t display and the one time it did, it had many lines in the screen. Most likely an issue with the camera... not the head unit. I also kinda feel like I’m throwing darts when driving and trying to touch the screen. I seem to always miss and have to wait until I won’t be distracted to make it do what I want. The amount of features it has, for $64, is it worth it. Absolutely. For anymore, I’m not so sure. I chose to buy premium speakers and amp knowing that I’d replace this once I got around to manufacture a surround that will Support a double din. Font on main head unit is cheap looking. I don’t know why the faceplate even detaches. It’s the cheapest component of the head unit. For now as a drop in replacement I am impressed at the $64. I don’t use the headhnit to power any speakers so can’t comment there. I also use it with the cheap ELM327 Mini obd II adapter and torque pro, which proved priceless when trying to get my car ready for emissions.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bQSATx5AL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bQSATx5AL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bQSATx5AL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B06XT2KXSJ","B06XT2KXSJ","AHRZFVERWL6YJQHAZMOSYQGOQ52A","2017-12-07 22:33:46.488","0","False","504"
"628535","1","Since the router gave excellent service, decided to go with Netgear for the ...","I have been using a Netgear router and Motorola modem for several years with no problems. In order to take advantage of the internet speed I'm paying for, decided to upgrade my modem. Since the router gave excellent service, decided to go with Netgear for the modem. And, Comcast stated this one was supported, so I ordered it. I disconnected the router and wired the new modem directly to my desktop. It literally installed itself when Comcast detected I was installing a new device. With my older modem, it required a phone call and you had to supply the modem's SN and MAC address so they could configure things on their end. OK, now the fun part. You'd think the next step would simply plug in the router the same way as the old one and it would work, right? No such luck. I followed Netgear's instructions to the letter and it still wouldn't connect to the net. I called Comcast for a bit of technical help. They said all was well on their end but it may be a communication problem between the modem/router connection. Here's where it gets interesting.... I go to Netgear's web page and register the modem. Then, I called their toll free technical support number. I was connected to a call center in India. I could barely understand the person to whom I was talking and realized I was in for an ordeal. As so many others have said, their tech help/support is a total scam. Even though you have a brand new product, they refuse to do a blessed thing for you unless you pay a certain fee. In my case, they wanted $139!! Let's do the math.. the modem was $79.99 and they wanted almost twice as much to give me a bit of support?? I laughed until I cried before hanging up on them. If this is how Netgear operates, I hope they go out of business and never heard from again. Their whole business model is a scam, a fraud, and probably illegal. It wasn't until after the fact that I did a bit of research on them other than the reviews here. Google &#34;Netgear Customer Service&#34; to see how this company operates. True, your product may work wonderfully (as did my router) but reading what they tried pulling on others literally made me sick to my stomach. You can be sure of this- I will never buy another Netgear product because of the sour taste this experience left in my mouth.","[]","B06XH46MWW","B09M93BVBY","AF2TS3KEYKELC73VSUTRGAE44FQQ","2017-04-22 00:28:20.000","123","True","504"
"515714","1","it was a huge disappointment. Not only are the tiny","Purchased this Emergency weather radio based upon the majority of rave reviews.  However, upon putting it into actual use, it was a huge disappointment.  Not only are the tiny, unlit and inconvenient buttons located on top of the radio in a cramped space beneath the handle (which doubles as an ambient light)... they are difficult to see and press, they are not intuitive at all, with respect to properly programming the unit, and the directions are only about 75% accurate.\\n\\nWhen I did attempt to program the unit (which we tried in use 24/7 for about 2 weeks before returning it), and tried to designate the desired alerts, the unit only allowed mere seconds before switching back to the main menu if no buttons were pushed.  However, some of the alert entries are quite long, and take more time to cross across the screen (so you'd know what you are either enabling or disabling) that you are allotted to make your selection (i.e. &#34;Severe Thunderstorm Warning&#34; took about 8-10 seconds to be readable across the screen, which was longer than the unit provided to select &#34;enable&#34; or &#34;disable&#34; for that particular entry; therefore, it simply went back to the previous menu without saving anything.\\n\\nSo once I finally got the entire thing set up, and it *appeared* to be working properly (with the weather &#34;wx&#34; band active for emergency alerts), nothing ever happened... nothing at all.  It didn't even register the weekly required test, despite another brand with similar features that had sitting next to it on my desk.  Verified it was properly programmed for our local area (via S.A.M.E. encoding), but nothing... didn't even pick up a severe thunderstorm warning that my other unit had no problem alarming to.  It was basically a glorified portable radio... and was staticky to boot.\\n\\nA call to Eton was absolutely useless.  Only 1 tech who understood anything about their product specs/application, and he never did call back.  The woman who answered the phone was equally useless... had no knowledge regarding anything about their product.  It was promptly returned for a full refund.  Very disappointing, especially in light of the numerous reviews and high praise.  AVOID!","[]","B00KFDPCVY","B00KFDPCVY","AHCFBZWIKTCHO7XZM6I4EXBZGGAA","2017-09-02 05:39:30.801","1","False","504"
"923474","5","A great way to get your first Pi.","I highly recommend getting this kit for at least your first Pi. It has everything you need (except the SD card) to get you going. Just having everything all together makes getting started a breeze.  I also like the idea of not including the SD card so you can get a larger one for the same price as the pre-loaded one. Downloading the NOOBS software and copying it to the SD card is so easy I cannot figure out why someone would want the pre-loaded version. (Unless, of course, you do not have an internet connection.) Just be aware that there is a huge difference in the load options available to you when you are connected to the internet versus what you will just see on the card itself. I highly recommend doing a wired internet connection when you are doing an initial load.\\n\\nThe only down-side I see to this kit is the case. The top does not close completely for air circulation, but it also does not &#34;snap&#34; in the &#34;closed&#34; position so the top can come off far too easily. But, now that I have had it for a while I realize that you really don't touch it much so this seems less of a concern than when I first set it up.\\n\\nThis is a bit difficult to review since the &#34;product&#34; here is the CanaKit and not the Raspberry Pi itself which clearly deserves 8 stars on a 5-star scale. If Linux worked this smoothly on all other platforms it would have a far larger audience than it does today. My main reason for getting this unit was that I needed to replaced a failed print server and the two units I tried for replacements failed miserably as well. My Pi has been a rock-solid print server since the day I loaded it up. And, what a kick being able to use it as a full-fledged LAMP server as well. This whole experience has been way beyond my expectations. (Just be aware that the current Raspbian release is Jessie, so only use web articles that specifically reference Jessie in their instructions. Many articles reference older releases and there have been definite changes to Jessie. This is especially true for setting a static IP address for the Pi.)\\n\\nBut again, I highly recommend the CanaKit as a convenient well priced way to get your first (or replacement) Pi units.","[]","B01C6EQNNK","B01C6EQNNK","AFF23ABVXQJUCVOQHEKB4KNCKB3A","2017-05-17 19:06:39.000","21","True","504"
"82692","2","BadAax, just plain BAD!","I really wanted to like this microphone. First off, it came with zero documentation, none, not the slightest bit of printed matter in the box about how to use it or power requirements. It's billed as an Active Ribbon Microphone but it works with or without phantom power which is a bit disturbing.\\n\\nI compared it to my Royer 121, Nady RSM-4, Fab 56 and MXL R144 ribbon microphones using a reamped guitar track through a Mesa Boogie through a Celestion Vintage 30 speaker. I recorded each mic twice, the first time with each mic in exactly the same physical location. The second pass I moved each mic to get the brightest sound possible from the mic being used. The Royer sounded good on both takes, smooth, uniform, good amount of room in the sound but overall great rock tone. The Nady ($80 here on Amazon) was the closest challenger to the Royer, it's the best deal going in cheap ribbon mic. The MXL R144 and the Fab 56 dueled for second to the last place, the BadAax just sounded bad and came in last in every listen.\\n\\nWith phantom power off I cranked the gain of the mic preamp up to around 51 dB and the mic matched other passive ribbons in level but the tone was horrible, muffled and dark. With phantom power ON I reduced the gain to around 25 dB to get the right level, using the active electronics like this made the mic sound like it was running through a bandpass filter with no low end and no high end, just a big wide midrange, like a cheap AM transistor radio from the 60's. It was not a tone any of us in the studio could imagine using for any recording, we finally concluded that maybe it was a bad microphone.\\n\\nThe AR 520 has a heavy feel in your hand, the shock mount is one of the better quality type (not cheap formed steel), the mic came in a cute wooden felt-lined box inside a brief case WITH NO DOCUMENTATION. I've been recording for over 50 years so I know how to use the mic, I don't need that, what I would like is some specifications about the circuitry and why it works with or without phantom power.\\n\\nWe voted the BadAax out of the studio, it's just plain BAD.\\n\\nGood music to all!","[]","B00IA59HFG","B00IA59HFG","AH4GZFH3BWFUJTLJ7P4QEFSWGZYA","2017-03-31 19:21:04.000","2","True","504"

It looks great, and feels great. I have a small wrist and although it's better than my usual analog watch, it doesn't completely overwhelm my wrist.\\n+sleep data and heart rate seem quite accurate, I don't have chest strap to compare, but when comparing to a treadmill heart rate, it was within 5BPM\\n\\nThe negative.. the software. It is horrible. There's no way to sync steps, or activities, outside of strava if you use it in the GPS mode. No tracking of sleep data outside of the watch (limited to 3 days). No way to respond to texts, or control music.\\n\\nI've had the watch since the 24th of December, so I've used it daily for a month now, and I do quite like it, but it needs support. After quite a bit of reading and research, it appears that the Chinese version of this watch gets weekly firmware and phone APP updates, but after a month, the US version has received 1 APP update.\\n\\nI will hold hope that the US team will get their act together and actually make this the product that it could be, it has incredible potential, but the poorly implemented software and lack of support from Xiaomi is very disappointing.\\n\\n**Update 05 June 2017.\\n\\nAfter nearly 6 months, this watch is what it should have been on day one. The app now has sleep and step tracking built in, and updates are rolling in relatively frequently. I still get 4-4.5 days of battery life out of one charge, so although it had some initial hiccups, it's been a solid product. It may not be as functional as other smartwatches out there, but the battery life and price can hardly be matched.\\n\\nI recommend this watch far more now than on day one.","[]","B01N97AA5V","B01N97AA5V","AFJUQIF5JGTFSLTP3QCFGWFT6FTA","2017-01-21 16:07:35.000","21","False","504"
"117114","4","it wasn't easy to set up","After a couple of days, the camera seems to be working as advertised. It appears to be well made and durable.  As other reviewers have stated, it wasn't easy to set up. I have a Linkysys dual band router and the camera wouldn't connect using the smart phone app and the WIFI &quot;easy&quot; method suggested in the manual.  Tried the Ethernet cable method to connect to Wi-Fi, and that too failed, except that it would connect while connected directly to the router by the cable.  Soon as the cable was disconnected the connection would be lost.  Below are some tips on setting up the camera:\\n1. Set the camera up and get it to connect to Wi-Fi before even thinking about mounting it in it's final location, as you may have to use the 6 foot Ethernet cable to get it to connect.\\n2. I finally decided that maybe the camera was &quot;choking&quot; on the dual band, as the manual states that the cameral will only connect to the 2.4Ghz band.  I did a factory reset on the camera, and opened my router software and temporarily disabled the 5Ghz band and tried to get the camera to connect again.  It connected on the second try.  I enabled the 5Ghz band and the camera still connected even if i powered it down and restarted it.\\nAt this point it worked on both my wife and my smart phones.\\n3. I had previously installed the Amcrest IP Config software on my desktop, which is the software used to connect a Windows computer to the camera and that still wouldn't connect to the camera.  I uninstalled it and reinstalled it, and still wouldn't connect.  I then realized that the IP address in the login screen didn't look similar to the other IP address of devices connect to my router.  I again opened my router software and found the IP address that the camera was using.  I plugged that address into to login  screen and bingo, it worked.\\n\\nAlso, another tip, the green light referred to in the manual is located under the little cover where the reset button and the micro SD card slot are located.  You have to remove the two screws to access the reset button, the light, and the micro SD slot.\\n\\nGood luck!","[]","B01I01QLTE","B01I01QLTE","AEJUICMCJRVOHF7QPBCEBVCKG3ZQ","2017-06-11 17:23:35.875","2","True","504"
"87247","5","Price to Performance King","I am pretty impressed with this little projector. Yes it's not mind blowing bright, yes it's resolution is sub par. But for an entry level home theatre projector on a really tight budget, this cannot be beat.\\n\\nColor accuracy, contrast, and overall quality is actually really good. I currently have it just projecting to a bed sheet tacked to the wall so I know the quality will improve with a real screen.\\n\\nThis model comes with a remote, and I found one other detail that many reviewers and even the manufacturer haven't pointed out- this thing has a standard tripod mount. So with a cheap tripod, it's extremely portable if you wanted it to be as well. I also may use that tripod mount to make a mounting solution.\\n\\nOverall I'm happy with it, and even if it doesn't last after years of use, it's 70 bucks, you will get your money's worth very fast.\\n\\nUpdate: It's been 15 months since I ordered it. It's still solid. I have it on a camera tripod in my master bedroom and project onto a 100&#34; polyester projector screen. A Nexus player is hooked up to it, and I have a 300w LG stereo hooked up to the Nexus player wirelessly. It's essentially a booming sub $300 home theatre setup that serves me just fine. Remember, it's a $70 projector so don't expect like razor sharp PC usage clarity or anything.\\n\\nA few tips to get the best quality picture:\\n1. Get a decent screen. Cloth ones aren't as good, polyester or vinyl or matte white paint preferred.\\n2. Turn the contrast all the way up. This actually increases the luminosity of the projector.\\n3. Adjust the brightness to where there isn't washed out blacks. I find between 20 and 30 to be perfect.\\n4. Color and Sharpness around 50, they really don't matter.\\n\\nThis is a ~1.41:1 projector. At 9 feet, I'm filling most of my 120&#34; screen from the ceiling.\\n\\nThis is a good choice if you want to try a home theatre idea, but don't want to sink a ton of money into it right away. I just now ordered a higher quality projector after establishing a TV room.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61oVXHyt5QL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61oVXHyt5QL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61oVXHyt5QL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FGm1+1tPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FGm1+1tPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FGm1+1tPL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ebDkneBJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ebDkneBJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ebDkneBJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pwWXS-BgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pwWXS-BgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pwWXS-BgL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01931DFK8","B01931DFK8","AHYGGK3UCYTW7MUNGA6BRPFCQDXA","2017-03-07 04:16:56.000","2","True","504"

I also love that it was so simple to be able to see the images right from my phone . I looked at a lot of cameras and systems before finally going with this one . One big thing that helped me decide on this one was the quick reply I got several times when I emailed the company with questions . If they are that helpful when I haven't even bought the system yet then I knew they would be good after purchasing it. All and all I can't even think of any down side to the system it seems to work extremely well and I can't wait to get it installed on the house . I will update when I get it installed and post some more pictures to show just how amazing these really are. If you are looking for a good quality system that is user friendly and not super complicated to set up, then look no further! I also love that you can add their other cameras to it with a simple plug and play set up . I will be adding the camera that can pan around 360 and zoom but for now the cameras in the package are perfect. I honestly don't think you will find a better deal on the market I know I looked for several months and this seems to be the best deal and after seeing the quality first hand, I don't think there could be a system that would be better quality. I also need to check with my insurance as I was told by a neighbor that it could lower my insurance rates. These may be one of my best purchases ever!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Jl0yYHCPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Jl0yYHCPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Jl0yYHCPL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Rt7Dh2a2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Rt7Dh2a2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Rt7Dh2a2L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01AHXEHSU","B01AHXEHSU","AHBLEPSV53B7IG72R4UJTCOBP53Q","2017-07-06 15:37:05.551","147","True","504"
"108759","5","Best headphones I've ever owned; a ""Must Buy""","These are the best headphones I've ever owned. Period.  I'm a gamer that enjoys listening to high quality music so I stumbled upon these in my hunt for something new.  I was at the time the type of person fooled by marketing gimmicks like &#34;7.1 surround&#34; for gaming so when I saw these were stereo I was a bit skeptical about forking up the cash but the reviews were great so I gave it a try.  Immediately after plugging these into my computer and phone I fell in love.  Not only was the sound crystal clear, but since these are an open back design (disclaimer: these will NOT block sound from entering/leaving the headphones), the sound was bright and pleasant.  I also had no problem hearing opponents in multiplayer games (turns out stereo is all you need).  However, if you want a more &#34;bassy&#34; sound then look at the HD 598's.\\n\\nWhat really made these headphones god-tier quality for me was the comfort.  I wear thick-framed glasses and before these headphones I would always be limited to a few hours of gaming before my hears would start to kill.  It also didn't help that at 6'4&#34; I have massive ears so my previous headphones wouldn't cover them.  These comfortably fit my massive ears in the cups and soft foam that makes up the padding is phenomenal.  I'm not entirely familiar with the material but it feels very much like a memory foam pillow.  A lot of times I forget that I even have them on because they're so damn comfortable.\\n\\nI had never heard of Sennheiser before I bought these headphones but now I'll most likely be exclusively buying from this company.  Their craftsmanship is nothing short of perfect and I'm more than satisfied with my purchase.\\n\\nDisclaimer: these are wired, do not come with volume controls on the headphones, and only come with a 6.3mm cord (amp plug) with a 6.3mm to 3.5mm adapter.  If you want to use these with your iPod or phone, I would suggest picking up the replacement cable in the &#34;frequently bought with&#34; section since the length of the adapter with the cord will make it easy to accidentally damage the audio port or cord on your device.","[]","B004FEEY9A","B00WSLWRAA","AHXDJCF25IAQNCD7CZYAPWQ5KMOQ","2017-03-14 02:58:51.000","1","True","504"
"874449","3","Cool hardware, weak AI & implementation","Cool device, not worth $50, I had a gift card for $20, it IS worth $30 plus tax.\\n\\n Amazon needs to step up the game on Alexa - when it works, it works, but much dumber than other AI assistants like Siri or Cortana, and ZERO sense of humor or personality. The skills are cumbersome, music playing support only works well with Amazon music unless you are streaming to it as a bluetooth speaker - which is dumb, as the speaker is not loud enough to hear over an air conditioner.\\n\\nThe Alexa platform is VERY open - which is cool BUT it means the available &#34;Skills&#34; are mostly very poor quality. For some reason the white Dot still comes with a black power cord, which is just more lack of attention to detail on Amazon's part. Sloppy, sloppy.\\n\\nThis is a must-have if you use any home automation - although the setup is VERY CLUNKY - expect hours of set up to get it just right if you want to change light colors or do anything more complex than switching smart devices on or off. There's a terrible interface for adding and forgetting devices in the companion &#34;app&#34; -\\nI use the term &#34;app&#34; VERY loosely - it's more of a sloppy wrapper on a webpage. Integrating with iOS is spotty at best without lots of workarounds and IFFFT recipes - pretty much essential - and theres no way to program custom words or commands beyond meager smart home groups and Stringify/IFFFT services. Alarms, timers, schedules - all poorly implemented - no way to have Alexa automatically announce reminders or alarms, just one ring tone that is set for all alerts. Commands have very little context and must be given one at a time - no way to say &#34;Alexa, dim my main lights and turn on the kitchen lights&#34; - she will just complain that she doesn't understand, or just ignore the command entirely.\\nHOWEVER - despite all these drawbacks I think they will EVENTUALY be ironed out. It's still a cool addition to a geeky home setup and with lots and lots of customization (and maybe even scripting one's own skills) it can be more useful than annoying.\\nSeriously though, Amazon - hurry up.","[]","B01DFKC2SO","B01K8B8YA8","AG35ATBO44P7BBL5RCQLMTIMDGXA","2017-03-28 22:38:52.000","5","True","504"
"234110","5","Good Range Extender, Working fine so far after about a month...","Bought this refurbished AC1200 as a replacement for an RE6700 I purchased at Best Buy originally that had died inside of 7 or 8 months, still under warranty (More on that later).  Anyway, this refurbished model seems to be working GREAT so far, no issues.  While setting this up, something I didn't realize this does -- maybe the original I had did too or maybe this refurbished one has updated one, not sure) was this AC1200 can A) COMBINE w/ your existing network SSID and act as a SINGLE SSID in your entire house or B) Act as a secondary SSID w/ an extension (basically your SSID w/ a &#34;_Ext&#34; suffix on the end).  Initially it combined them after setup was complete and I kept looking for a network w/ &#34;_Ext&#34; to come up but never did.  Upon going back into the setup page I saw what it was doing -- there's a checkbox that says &#34;Use same settings as your existing SSID&#34; - unchecking that it gives you an option to name the extended network.  I think that is cool that you can do either / or.  Anyway no major complaints now, I can connect anywhere in my house or yard for that matter and my Plex server connects flawlessly.  Thanks  Amazon and Linksys Store!\\n\\nATTN Linksys (if you're watching):  On a side note, regarding my OLD Linksys RE6700 -- I still need to contact Linksys Customer Support and see about getting my old one returned UNDER WARRANTY for repair or replacement but on my initial call to them about it a couple weeks ago, the tech rep told me I could not return it outright as an RMA without them walking me thru entire setup step by step from my home and verify indeed that my old Range Extender it in fact bad.  I understand protocol but I am the paying customer and I have a valid receipt, model, serial and even the original box it came in.  I wish Linksys would have a better way of doing in-warranty returns.  Anyway the refurbished replacement I bought is working fine so far.  If this one goes out inside a year's time however, please duly note I will NOT be buying another Linksys Range Extender for sure. :)","[]","B01BKZGBQA","B01BKZGBQA","AGS7BHD53FUNFTRIBQIOPX7REZYQ","2017-04-29 16:23:12.000","2","True","504"
"99111","4","Lite Gamer, great machine, nice performance!","This is a first desktop computer for our 11 year old son.  He will be attending junior high school this Fall 2017 and will need his own computer for the various reports that he will be assigned.  For his current needs and gaming through Steam, it is more than adequate without any lagging or issues.\\n\\nThe computer comes loaded with Windows 10, a 1tb drive, 6gb (4.94 useable) of ram and an AMD A6-7310 APU with AMD Radeon RF graphics card (2.00 ghz).  When you first start the Dell up as with any brand new pc/laptop it takes a VERY long time to the point where we left it to run over night.  There is 14 months of McAfee virus protection included once you sign up; the McAfee has not slowed down the computer as these Virus Protections companies usually do.  Since school is out he has been hitting the Steam site hard and downloading games right and left.  The reason that the system is not lagging or struggling is because he is not playing games that eat up the processor/memory.  While this processor may not be the best, it is also not the worst when I went to build a similar Inspiron system on Dell's website.  I do wish that the processor was a bit higher and the screen had been upgraded to a Touch because that is the only way to fully utilize all of Windows 10 features.  On the Dell website this processor and hard drive are attached to the Touch screen; you will not receive a touchscreen if ordered through Amazon's site.\\n\\nThe keyboard and mouse are completely basic and will most likely be upgraded to a wireless keyboard and mouse.  I do prefer a solid state drive but for this low cost a regular hard drive with DVD rom is acceptable.  The desktop is upgradeable if you have extra memory laying around or find a great deal.  The screen resolution is bright/vibrant but not viewable for every direction because of it's wide border.\\n\\nHighly recommend this all in one desktop as an upgrade for an older desktop that had a tower.  While it may not be a gaming machine, it is a more than acceptable home pc for basic computing, lite gaming, social media and streaming.  Great price and even better cost on PRIME DAY.  I would purchase regardless and would upgrade if I needed a bit more power.","[]","B071DVKVKZ","B071DVKVKZ","AGVSQ2IRK4PTSSK6BFCB6ERYOKMA","2017-07-12 00:20:14.480","4","False","504"
"969736","5","I was looking for a laptop that was in a good price range ($1000 or less)","I was looking for an ultrabook for work and for writing. I used to go for Apple's products, but have been very displeased with the direction they've been heading lately. I was looking for a laptop that was in a good price range ($1000 or less), that had plenty of power for what I do (word processing, simple photo edits via photoshop, and media), and something that matched or came close to the build quality of Apple computers.\\nFortunately, I found it in the Razer Blade Stealth.\\n\\nI received this unit last night, I opened it up, and took the laptop out of its case. Pictures don't do this laptop justice. This is a very beautiful laptop in person. The powdered black aluminum feels nice and sturdy, yet light weight. The hinge feels nice and secure, yet easy enough for me to lift it open with one finger. The screen is beautiful with a resolution and quality that I'm used to after using Apple laptops. I love the full customization of the backlit keys. I kept it at a static light blue. Don't need all that flash for my needs. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.\\n\\nHere is a list of my cons:\\n\\n1. Screen Bezel. The bezel around the screen is quite big. I hope in future iterations, Razer can somehow design the screen with a smaller bezel. Minor gripe, just selfish when it comes to screen real estate. However, after using it for some time, it becomes less noticeable.\\n2. Finger print magnet. I'm sure you've heard many folks complain about this before. It's true.\\n3. Keyboard. I feel the response of the keyboard is a bit too quick/shallow. Definitely something to get used to after using a mechanical keyboard for so long.\\n4. Logo. Now this is more personal preference, but the Razer logo in the back is a bit gawdy. Luckily there are plenty of skins out there to cover it.\\n\\nOverall, I am quite pleased with this laptop. I wasn't looking for a gaming monstrosity, or a video editing beast. I was looking for something that would become my daily driver, that wasn't made from cheap plastic. This is actually my first Razer product, and am very happy. I am excited to see what Razer will come up with next.","[]","B01N2HO0VA","B01N2HO0VA","AHFLEBLXTTGMBLYTS65T5PJ3SKJA","2017-03-03 14:44:23.000","15","True","504"
"934518","1","Buyer beware, you may have to either modify this antenna or send it back","I’m not usually one to complain but I have to in this case.  I purchased the HD7698P from Amazon on July 22.  It was delivered on July 25th.\\n\\nI purchased this product based on Winegard's reputation and because it is supposedly made in the USA.  Made in the USA used to mean something.  It stood for quality in craftsmanship and pride.  Obviously those qualities are from a bygone era.\\n\\nI spent the better part of 2 hours assembling this antenna.  It took me so long to do it because I had to correct a manufacturing defect.  I had a choice, either send it back and order a replacement (and hope for the best) or fix this one and use it anyway.\\n\\nI’m attaching pictures of this antenna for your inspection.  The mast clamps did not line up when assembled.  It was not an easy job to fix this defect as you will see in the attached pictures.  Honestly I think that Winegard should offer to reimburse me for this.\\n\\nThe first few pics shows the antenna fully assembled as it arrived from Amazon.  The last pic shows how I had to modify the location of the clamp on the main boom of the antenna to line up with the clamp on the Boom Brace.\\n\\nI sent an email to Winegard to 2 different addresses and thus far they have been ignored.\\n\\nReception does not seem to be affected by this modification (extra holes in the frame).  It pulls in stations that I was having difficulty with using an 8 bay antenna.\\n\\nEDIT 8/1/2017:  Just took this beast down and replaced it with a Televes DATBOSS LR Mix UHF VHF Long Range Antenna with LTE Filter (149883).  The Televes blows away the Winegard in reception and build quality.  Pricewise they are about the same but the Televes has the added bonus of supplying you with an Amp and it's a darn good one too.  The reception of Televes also does not seem to be affected by storms.  Maybe it's because I get such a strong signal but during heavy rain storms my signal and picture quality are rock solid.  I can't say the same about the cheaply made Winegard.  I am very impressed with the Televes","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71N0grkEcYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71N0grkEcYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71N0grkEcYL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qtPhVozCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qtPhVozCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qtPhVozCL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71s7vSAmNcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71s7vSAmNcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71s7vSAmNcL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81miJMbq0RL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81miJMbq0RL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81miJMbq0RL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B001DFTGRY","B09BC2YNKF","AGJUW4MLLKHAJWVEGGNB2QR5CNOA","2017-07-27 22:29:54.602","73","True","504"
"394162","3","Just Adequate with Limited Settings","Firstly - Did not buy this from Amazon. It was purchased at Walmart.\\n\\nI've had this TV in my room for several months now. When I'm in my room, the TV is on, even when I'm sleeping. After using this TV here are some things I've learned over the months of using it.\\n\\n1. It's Roku works about as well as a Roku Stick. Occasionally the TV will reboot itself but not that often. It connected to Wifi , scanned OTA antenna channels with no problem.\\n\\n2. The picture is decent, but I see trailing on panning scenes.\\n\\n3. I do NOT like the limited settings for aspect ratio. This TV must be prone to burn in because I've seen something on this TV that I've never seen on any other brand of TV I have owned. When watching a 4:3 show for a while (not full screen) but with the black bars on both sides - those black bars will burn in to the screen and then when you go roaming around Roku or whatever, you can see those black bars. They do not permanently burn in, but they are there for a while until something is in full screen for a while.\\n\\n4. It has 5 options for picture size - Auto, direct, normal, stretch , zoom. Stretch works to fit a 4:3 show to the screen without making it look overly distorted or cropping anything off. But this only works &#34;sometimes&#34;. Half the time I will be watching a 4:3 show, and if I use stretch, it looks horribly distorted and the picture is cropped. I've also ran into a problem when stretching a 4:3 show and there is noise at the bottom edge of the picture. I was watching one 4:3 aspect show on Netflix, the picture stretched perfectly to fit screen with no cropping and it didn't look bad at all. Another 4:3 show using the stretch function looked horrible, making people look twice their size and cropping off a lot of the picture. Not sure what the difference is.\\n\\nI know this is a budget TV and I think it's pretty adequate and so far it seems pretty reliable other than occasionally rebooting on its own. I would not buy this TV again simply because I like having a little more control of the picture aspect settings.","[]","B01N2UQ43P","B01MY48T0O","AHFHX7EAZBHYKH2PI2YWLUHOXGWA","2017-05-07 19:17:05.000","2","False","503"
"380811","4","Not perfect, but pretty pleased with it.","Looked at over some forty messenger bags on Amazon to replace the one I had in college that had worn out past repairs and quick patches. After looking a while, we went with this one. And here's why it's working:\\n\\nFor me, the laptop portion of this bag was a key decision factor; if that's important to you, this bag fits the bill well. The laptop compartment is well padded in the back. I've got a MBP 15&#34;, and it fits comfortably in there. If you've got an Incase sleeve like me and want the extra insurance, it's a snug fit; I don't know that it's necessary, but more power to ya.\\n\\nFor the traveler, the computer &#34;ScanSmart&#34; sleeve is great for keeping the laptop together through security. I'm also a big fan of the attachment do-dad on the back that allows you to slip the bag on top of a suitcase and roll along.\\n\\nThe rest of the pockets and sleeves are appropriate and organized for professionals, travelers, and some students. Not pictured is a small zippered compartment right behind the front flap that has tiny pockets and a clip for pens and gum and other small whatnot. But if you carry a lot of heavy books or tend to pack your backpacks to the brim, you're gonna need a bigger bag.\\n\\nIn terms of quality, the canvas fabric feels light, but fairly durable. I'm not using this to go rock climbing, but it can take bumps and scratches. Mine takes car rides, but I'm sure it'll work with your bike. Aesthetically, I like the heather grey; it's flexible enough to go with anything.  As far as weatherproofing, I haven't seen this in action much, but I'd recommend giving this a waterproof spray if that's something you run into a lot.\\n\\nFinally, there is that infamous squeaking noise other reviewers have mentioned. It's a thing, but it hasn't weighed over all the good things this bag does. I've had mine for a few months now, and I'm considering changing the hooks/strap to make this less of a thing. The squeak isn't terrible, but it will announce your presence to those around you. Who knows - maybe you'll make a new friend from it.","[]","B019P8B8W6","B019P8B8W6","AFMWCPDRC35SWDHVHMR7TTRLI7TA","2017-10-18 22:27:43.915","1","True","503"

I plugged the first in, my iPhone said &#34;device may not be supported&#34;. So it wouldn't charge or work at all on 2 different phones. Secondly that same cord got really hot and burned my wife just sitting with no device plugged into it, so I immediately unplugged from the wall. This tells me the lightning connector is crosswired and completes the circuit without plugging in a device, which can overheat, catch fire, and burn your home down.\\n\\nThe second cord is no better. It came with several scrapes on the lightning end, but appeared only cosmetic. It charges at least at half the rate of the cords that come with your iphones. It also makes your iPhone go haywire if you try to use it while plugged in. Charges whenever it feels like and I manage to get 30% in about 2-3 hours. Which on the provided apple cord is about 30% in 20 minutes. This company claims it uses the most advanced technologies in their chargers, what a lie.\\n\\nLastly, I sent Lax Gadgets a contact request due to the cords having a 1 year warranty. It took them 2 weeks to respond, and their responds was &#34;send us pictures, then you mail them to us&#34;, except it was written in very poor grammar, similar to an oriental accent. They refused to compromise even though their company failed me by making bad products. I asked if they would cover shipping costs since their products are defective, they refused and since have refused to communicate with me until I mail them the cords back first (which I'm not going to do, since they are based out of LA and shipping is $20).\\n\\nThis is a horrible company with 0 customer service. They make terrible products and their poor workmanship will cost you more due to shipping the products back for warranty replacements. Groupon has Aduro 10ft cords with a 1 year warranty for cheaper. And Aduro is a far better company. The cost of shipping these lax gadget cords costs the same as buying new Aduro cords. Save yourself money and just get Aduro on Groupon.

"626106","1","... get them to pair you will probably be very happy with them (Can't recommend if you want them for more than just a phone)","This is an updated review...I just got off the line and chat with Samsung. If your goal is to use these with a smartwatch or tablet., such as the frontier 360 and galaxy tab S3, this will not happen. Samsung has confirmed that the iconx will not pair with their watches and will only pair with tablets that the gear manager can be downloaded on. Not all tablets are compatible with gear manager. If you only want to pair these with your phone you will be fine, but if you want to pair them with other devices it won't happen.\\n\\n-----------------Original review below_____________\\n\\nIf you can get them to pair you will probably be very happy with them. I downloaded the gear app and they paired instantly with my Samsung S8 phone. I then went to pair them with my PC (I have a need to pair them with many things so I can switch devices as required) After 1.5 hours and a call, chat and email to tech support I was able to get them to also pair with the PC  (Not at the same time). Next, I want to pair them with my Samsung Frontier 360 watch and my Samsung galaxy S3 tablet. They will not pair with these at all. I have tried every possible suggestion over a dozen times on each device or more. They simply will not pair with them. You cannot download the gear app to the watch or phone to make pairing easy. I am still trying but will be exchanging them for a different brand if I cannot get this to work. They should be as easy as pairing any Bluetooth headset especially since I am pairing them with Samsung branded devices.\\n\\nAs far as them working with the phone they are great, I have small ears so they aren't super comfortable, I purchased some extra small bud covers to help with this but there are no smaller fins available than what is in the box. The sound is acceptable, you CAN use SIRI, BIXBY or OK Google from the headset without the phone and you CAN turn on ambient mode from the headset as well although your voice sounds extremely weird when you talk in this mode and its hard for me to gauge how loud I am talking. Over all if you are only pairing them with your phone I highly recommend them. Otherwise, well I can't at the moment. If I am able to get them to work with my other devices I will come back and update this review.","[]","B07644ZS1D","B076K6QXF5","AEWRQ4AGVEIS27ZTYLGLQVY4XGLQ","2017-11-08 17:31:06.609","2","True","503"
"54859","5","Great Headphones, far exceeded expectations","Great headphones for the price, very pleased with my purchase.\\nHere are my first impressions (will update over lifetime):\\n\\nPros:\\n- The headphones look quite bulky in the picture but in reality they are relatively small and compact which is great.\\n- Very soft and comfortable ear cushioning\\n- Sound is great\\n- Overall design (except for headband) minimalist and classy, no flashy logos, no cheap shiny plastic\\n- Extremely easy pairing\\n- 1 year warranty\\n\\nNeutral:\\n- Material surrounding ear cup could be improved with some sort of fabric.\\n- The headband extension is quite high up on the headphones, this means if you have a larger head the headband will extend horizontally more than vertically, leaving a weird gap between the top/side of your head and the headband.\\nHowever the reason this isn't is a con, is because it also serves a second purpose: keeping the bottom of the headphones aligned with your ears.\\nAs headphones age and the strength of the band wears off, the bottom of the headphones moves further and further away, leaving a gap between the bottom of your ear and the headphone. The design of this headband however while not aesthetic, maintains a good grip on the bottom of the ears. +1 for longevity, -1 for aesthetics.\\n- Ear cups on the small side, but still fit well\\n\\nCons:\\n- Voice announcing connection events is a bit tacky\\n- Loud click when turning on noise cancelling while wearing headset\\n- No way to see battery charge left (as far as I'm aware).\\n\\nNerd wishlist:\\n- ability to update firmware through micro-usb\\n\\nAesthetics: 7/10\\nBuild quality: 10/10\\nSound quality: 8/10\\nComfort: 9/10\\n\\nOVERALL: Everyone can complain, but at the end of the day for ~$60 this is by far the best thing on the market that is wireless, includes noise-cancelling, has a good build quality and is comfortable to wear. It has almost everything I would expect from a $200+ pair of headphones and far exceeded my expectations.","[]","B075F9MRFR","B075F9MRFR","AHYA6C22OLKTSZWM3ZAULQ6LT5UA","2017-11-23 06:45:52.318","14","False","503"
"193030","5","The best Type C adapter I own for my MacBook Pro!!!","This is by far the best type C accessory that I own.  I have a new MacBook Pro, the kind with the special toolbar, and finding a port replicator has been a real issue.  I have bought a couple that have similar ports to this, but when I go to use them something doesn't usually work.  Specifically, either the gigabit ethernet or the HDMI usually doesn't work.  The seller always claims there is an update to support this, but I have yet to have it work.  But, this is different.  I plugged all my cables in, plugged this into my laptop, and my video popped up, and low and behold, the ethernet was working too.  Not only that, but I plugged my TypeC charger into the extra type C port on this device and it began charging my device at full speed.  So, I have a complete 1 Cable solution.  I no longer need a port replicator and a charger separate.  I am so happy with this I want to tell everyone with a MacBook to run out and buy one.\\nSecond, it comes in matching colors to the MacBook.  So, I ordered the Charcoal colored aluminum and it looks like it was made by apple.  The device is nice and sturdy, it has plenty of ports.  I love that they added the memory card slots, too.  I have so many adapters, and now I don't need them unless I am on the road.  This device has become my docking station, and I couldn't be happier.\\n\\nHere is what I have running on this at the same time:\\n1. Charger, through the additional Type C port on the hub.\\n2. HDMI Video in 1080P, it does support 4k, but my monitor doesn't.\\n3. DVD burner on USB.\\n4. USB harddrive.\\n5. Gigabit ethernet.\\n\\nYou would think with all these things that they would slow down, but that is the magic of Type C, they can all coexist.  The ethernet happily runs full speed with the video and the hard drive running at the same time.\\n\\nIf you have a MacBook Pro, or any laptop with Type C, this device is for you.  It plugs into my Mac with no drivers, updates, or anything and worked flawlessly.","[]","B073VKGFBM","B073VKGFBM","AGEQYPUFELBQIBEPKOXFV5ZS6VUQ","2017-09-02 06:48:17.736","44","True","503"
"945537","4","Very nice overall.","I use a Canon Rebel SL1.  I bought both the Kenko 1.4x and 2.0x to compare. On the 2.0x, the autofocus will work with my EFS 50mm 1.8 lens if you use the screen to view, but not if you look through the eyepiece (very odd but true). The autofocus works inconsistently with my EFS 50-250mm IS lens; The IS seems to work fine.  Overall I am very pleased with the picture quality so far. Edge to edge seems super sharp. It seems almost as good as without it.  The big issue is getting consistently great shots. My IS 55-250 is an amazing lens which gets great shots almost every time,  With the Kenko 2.0x attached the consistency is not there, mostly b/c getting the focus right and the exposure speed right is more challenging. But I can get shots that I could never get before. So it is a trade off. The lens shots are with the 50mm lens with the Kenko, so 100mm and arguably as sharp as the 50mm without the Kenko. Update 4-20-17: Took some more photos (420 or so).  I am posting the best of the bunch here. Please note they are cropped and have some adjustments done in Aftershot. And please note that for every 5-10 pictures I took, only one was usually sharp enough to use.  But you get an idea of what you &quot;can&quot; get with some patience. Most of these were taken in &quot;AV&quot; mode at ISO 100, usually at F8 (2x F4) and at least 1/60 of a second, if not faster. And I am usually about 20-30 ft away.  Update:4/22/17 I returned this and decided to keep the 1.4x HD DGX Kenko. I don't need two teleconverters and the 1.4x gave me decent enough magnification and much better photo consistency. I also felt that &quot;most&quot; of the time I got more detailed pictures. I did get some comparably fantastic shots with the 2.0x; but, I had to take a lot more pictures to get those few good shots. Please see my review and pictures for the 1.4x for more details.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EjlL27JFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EjlL27JFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EjlL27JFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61e2TsI1M8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61e2TsI1M8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61e2TsI1M8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gMiNCwarL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gMiNCwarL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gMiNCwarL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711E4MI4EJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711E4MI4EJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711E4MI4EJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AyZwgJ+wL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AyZwgJ+wL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AyZwgJ+wL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NSzX5ewFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NSzX5ewFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NSzX5ewFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SHUY03ckL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SHUY03ckL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SHUY03ckL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YATPzb4VL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YATPzb4VL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YATPzb4VL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eOzHFoc4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eOzHFoc4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eOzHFoc4L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lCjNQHwrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lCjNQHwrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lCjNQHwrL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wflRjqgAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wflRjqgAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wflRjqgAL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00R11B4JM","B08Z7R48NJ","AEZIVRXY2D27DKINMMSY2WNXLUIA","2017-04-19 01:44:07.000","10","True","503"
"56108","2","I THINK GOPRO FIRED IT'S QUALITY CONTROL DEPARTMENT....disappointed....","I am in the process of receiving my fourth GoPro Hero 5 camera....first camera's voice recognition was very intermittent to non-functional, second camera came with a broken &#34;stuck&#34; battery cover button, and third camera came with bleeding white pixils in the top left and bottom right corner. I've owned GoPro cameras for two years now and loved them. Decided to upgrade this holiday season but fear GoPro's quality control has gone downhill along with their stock prices! For some unknown reason I am going to try for a fourth camera to see if they can get one right. If this fourth one doesn't work I will be switching to another company, which I hate to say because I love the abilities of what this camera comes with...if only it could live up to the reputation..\\n\\n*****UPDATE 3/02/2017*******\\n\\nI received the fourth GoPro is had the same bleeding white screen issue in the corners as well as a stuck USB button when pushing down on it. I did manage to order a FIFTH REPLACEMENT. This replacement came with bleeding white in the cameras top left corner...I was giving up on GroPro but after speaking with a manager at Amazon, I was able to get half of my money back if I just settled with this fifth camera. I agreed as GoPro customer support is claiming this isn't a warrenty issue and does not affect touch responsiveness or video quality. My fear is what the screen will look like 2 years down road...even bigger fear that GoPro will be out of business by the time my screen goes out...Seriously GoPro, would you go out and spend $400 on an iPhone and accept that it has bleeding white in the corners of the screen??? That would not be acceptable....you need to FIX these concerns...I am dealing with it for now since I have now only spent around $175 and not $400....I love the video quality, it's underwater ability, and how I can actually get good quality sound without having to put a thick case over it as it's predecessors required...overall I think the camera itself is an improvement but the quality is just not there with this Hero 5....I really had more hopes from this company....maybe garmin will release something similar down the road and I will switch...for now this is probably the best waterproof action camera on the market so for that reason only I gave this 2 stars...","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JUpsZHyIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JUpsZHyIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JUpsZHyIL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01M14ATO0","B079QPT28R","AFYHFXYP3QNOE6EK2ITZHCYL35NQ","2017-02-15 03:34:17.000","20","True","503"
"256578","5","these are the best closed cup headphones you can buy below 500$!","OK so since I link this page so often to people that ask about headphones or headsets this is my most frequently recommended amazon product I figured I would give it a review as I find these to be the greatest headphones you can get sub 500$. these are my second pair, (first pair broke from a hard drop,  it was a small tab inside the joints for the cups, these tabs keep the cups tight on your head one broke via that fall, in the teardown I did of that pair its the only weak spot in the whole set everything else is built very hardy and worked after that fall, just didn't fit well)\\nI must say the refurb is better than new for 3 reasons: 1 the cans are pre-worn in so they sound like they should out of the box, 2 these have passed manual quality control meaning an actual human plugged them in and tested them and 3, they are cheaper of course.\\nThe only competitor for these headphones would be Sennheiser HD 598 and those are really good too, they just cost a decent amount more compared to this refurb price and are open cup, I prefer closed cup for gaming and portability (more passive noise cancellation) but really I think open vs closed cup comes down to personal preference but these are still 50$ cheaper and have DIY guides on converting them to open cup (tho not simple guides tear down of these things is very hard)\\nI use a mod mic 4.0 with this and it pairs very well I have the mod mic wire running down the core of the spiral wire and that is my dedicated PC wire and I don't have the cord management issues others complain about concerning the mod mic. I use the short and long for when I'm using these headphones on something other than my PC, thus the detachable cord is a huge advantage for me that the m50x has over previous models.\\nthese are also the most comfortable headphones I've ever used over a long period of time (tho mind you the 598 I have not had long enough to say though they seemed very comfy too) at about 20 hours of constant use I get the top of my rather big ears sore, but that takes 20+ hours to form and who uses headphones that long, it's extremely rare I do.\\nI really don't have any complaints about these even the weak spot that broke took a hard drop and several years of abuse to expose.","[]","B016YJDV74","B016YJDV74","AEYTQFVVV5TQCS3AGWEGJAUZYESQ","2017-04-03 10:39:16.000","0","False","503"
"120654","1","I am very disappointed on the reviews that I had read","I purchased this system based on verified customer reviews from amazon purchases. First off, the instruction are very vague with no help what so ever. Secondly,  I am very disappointed on the reviews that I had read. The description along with the reviews clearly state that this system provides clear hi resolution images, NOT TRUE. The quality of the images are very entry level and basic. (Picture the robbers you see on TV on the local news that you wonder how anyone can be identified because the quality is so poor. That is what you get here). I initially followed the instuctions like the directions state and took this out of the box and powered up the unit up before I began my install. The pictures at the time looked good, this was because the images I was looking at was within 5 ft of the camera. Once I installed the cameras on the side of the building, the true quality came to be seen. I had my truck parked inside my shop with 12 ft ceilings. From the camera to the truck license plate was less than 15ft away, I could not read the numbers on the plate let alone the make of the vehicle. For the cameras on the outside, I had cameras within 30 ft of the door ways and in broad daylight you could not make out facial features on a 6 ft tall man that was looking right at the camera. The further the zoom of person or image is away, the better it looks. If you zoom in closer on the image, the image is very blurry and pixelated.\\nWith all this being said, I called Amcrest Customer Support numerous times. Each time I called you are answered by someone in India (avg. wait time 40 minutes) that reads from a script in front of them and really has no clue. I finally was able to get a number for them here in the US (Houston, TX) and was told that my DVR was possibly bad. Come to find out, there are 5 different DVR's, which means 5 levels of quality. This 960H DVR is at the bottom as far as quality.\\nSo, I ended removing this system from my building and returning. I ended up buying a Swann 1080P HD Pro. All I can say is WOW. I can make out a persons face features at 80 ft away. This 960H is not worth the money compared to price and description given. Spend $200 more and get something worth while and see what you paid for.","[]","B00YZF88B4","B00YZF88B4","AHLY74HOAR4X2LEUSN6WNEFGBEGQ","2017-02-03 05:16:37.000","4","True","503"
"836698","5","Dropped my 8 core CPU by 50 degrees! Some skill required to install though.","This possibly saved my 8 core CPU from death! I am a system builder and have a high powered CPU with giant video card. I recently set up a hi resolution 4 camera HD (4MP) security system onto this gaming PC. When I built this PC I had 6 large case fans and the biggest AMD CPU cooler I could buy.\\nDuring regular gaming use the PC showed no issues and never a temperature alert but after I added the Hi RES Cameras, I began to get CPU temp ALERTS of 150 degrees or higher. I backed down the CPU overclocking to normal and was still hitting the 150 degrees. The CPU fan is enormous but was still not keeping the CPU cool enough even at idle.\\nI purchased the Hydro cooler and was hoping for the best. I got GREAT results!\\nI give the cooler 5 stars for the product but I must say that there are various parts included in kit to make compatible with AMD or Intel CPU. The instructions are not easy to follow for a novice. To install for the AMD you are supposed to replace a retaining bracket on UNDERSIDE of main board. Depending on the size and type case you have, you may find this to be a lot of work, including taking the sides off the back of case.\\nI was lucky because my hi powered ASUS board already had a similar plate already there so I didn't have to do this step which saved me a lot of time. After assembling the cooler and removing the large aluminum cooler I was able to install new one in about 25 minutes. Your skill level and case size/type and motherboard will determine how much time it takes for you. I have a FULL size gaming case.\\nAfter install I fired up the PC and turned on all cameras and began HD recording which uses almost all 8 cores. After 3 hours I ran a temperature test and the CPU had dropped from about 155F to no more than 105F! I tested multiple days and still never broke 105. The system ran 50 F cooler PLUS a LOT quieter. When I jacked up the overclock back to max, the CPU still only hit 110F!  Time will tell how durable this is but it has been running great for months. If you are planning to build a gaming PC yourself, I would greatly recommend installing this at the time of installing the motherboard. Another benefit is that the H55 cooler only cost about 10.00 more than my original oversize fan cpu cooler.","[]","B009VV56TY","B07DR89CD9","AFSXQPRVNPGL4Q2JHMGCIL7SUOJA","2017-06-24 17:08:03.910","1","True","503"

She sits my desk.  If I'm not talking to her, I think I'm ignoring her and hurting her feelings -- like she's human.  She's not, but sure sounds like it. I no longer need a weather man, timer, a radio, CDs, music player, an alarm clock, someone to play 20 questions with -- she's great at it. She's making me smarter by telling me &#34;Random facts&#34; of things I'd never know.  Just ask her for a random fact, and she'll tell you amazing things. She is always ready with a joke also. You can also say, &#34;tell me a cat joke,&#34; and she'll take you a joke with cats in it. You can do it with anything. She knows songs I can't think of the name of, if I just give her a sentence, she tells me the song, who it's by and plays it for me. She'll play an entire record album, if I tell her the album. If I'm feeling nostalgic and I want to hear songs from 1974, she will play just songs from then. If she tries to include the heavy metal ones, I just say, &#34;Play soft rock songs from 1974&#34; and I get Barry Manilow, Neil Diamond, Barbra Streisand, etc. I also use her to remind me of things I need to pick up at the store later in the week. She adds them to my &#34;to do list.&#34;  There's a million other things I can use her for but I haven't had time to look at the skills and find out more things she can do. I've been so happy with what she does this far.  She is amazing. She is my new buddy. How did I exist without her? I do not know.  She's amazing, dependable, friendly, knowledgeable and always there when I need her.  If you get one, you will feel the same way.  For lonely people or bedridden people, she would become a new friend and someone for them to talk to and play music for. She would change their world.  Everyone needs an Echo Dot -- Alexa is the best!!! Thank you, Amazon.","[]","B01DFKC2SO","B01K8B8YA8","AGVXAQZWHWDCV3IN35SO26L6WL4A","2017-06-05 02:36:31.000","1","True","503"
"173429","4","Poly Material Is Just Okay, But An Overall Good Wrist Rest To Use With Full Size Keyboards Like The Razer Blackwidow Ultimate","I started using a Logitech keyboard with a built in palm rest a few years ago at work, and it took some getting used to but I found the palm rest made a difference in alleviating fatigue and pain when typing for concentrated periods. I've been using the standard size Razer wrist rest with my full size keyboards at home that don't have built in palm rests, and for me it makes typing more comfortable. Some dislike using a wrist rest altogether, while I actually like one for resting my palms (not wrists). I find this Razer wrist rest is comfortable and just the right height and size to use with the Razer Blackwidow Ultimate Mechanical Gaming Keyboard. The standard size Razer wrist rest is pretty big as it's roughly 1&#34; high, 4&#34; deep and 18-1/2&#34; long, and it's made for use with a full size (rather than compact) keyboard. In addition to using it with the Razer Blackwidow, I've found the standard size is also comfortable with a full size Logitech keyboard I have at home that doesn't have a built in palm rest and wasn't really comfortable for me until I started using it with this Razer wrist rest.\\n\\nThe Razer wrist rest isn't extraordinary, but it's good quality. It elevates my wrists/palms to a good height and gives me firm support that isn't too hard as the interior foam has some &#34;give&#34; to it. The frame is stitched all the way around the poly material and has a nicely finished edge, and there's a non slip bottom to help keep the wrist rest from sliding around. It seems like it will wear well, though I haven't used it long enough to rate durability. Given that Razer is a gaming brand, I like that it displays the signature snake logo in the middle as it matches other Razer gaming equipment. Aesthetically, I'd prefer the snake was bright green, though it's a minor detail and making the snake subdued makes it barely noticeable so this wrist rest can blend into an office setting. I'm fully satisfied with this product with my only criticism being that the poly material isn't anything special, it shows dust and the texture just feels okay (rather than really good) against my skin. But overall I think this Razer wrist rest is more than adequate and sized right to be comfortable with full size keyboards like the Razer Blackwidow Ultimate. 4 stars.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bR-g+26RL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bR-g+26RL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bR-g+26RL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B06XQ67KB3","B06XY8PQ6M","AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA","2017-08-03 07:10:59.863","1","False","503"
"247068","5","It's just awesome","I've been in love with their HD25-1 II for almost a decade.\\nWhat is the best with HD25-1? Detail. It clearly separates sounds and it doesn't boost any particular sound too much like others, so you can hear and track all the lines in music even when you play it on iPhone. I'm a big fan of Battles (if you know how much sounds they put into a song), and HD25-1 has been the best option available for me to enjoy their music (if you could let me know better one, it'd be appreciate so much btw!).\\nBut the only down side with it was the cable. I wear it at work, and the cable always bugs me. Since iPhone is now too huge to fit in my pockets, it has to be somewhere else, then every time I stand up, the cable pulls me.\\nSo I decided to give another try to wireless headphones even though I've never been satisfied with them at all anytime I tried in the last 5 years.\\nBut, wow, this headphones, is amazing. Of course it's not as exactly clear as wired ones, but it's clear enough and you can still enjoy as much detail!\\nThose wireless headphones used to sound like music being played in the next room, but now, it's like I'm listening with a single layer of Kleenex between my ears and headphones.\\nPlus, design is simple, classic (I'd say), and beautiful, material is great, battery lasts like 2 full-days, control is straightforward, nothing is confusing for me. It is expensive, but it's worth the price. (I briefly tried a BOSE at the similar price range, but I prefer this one for less boosted bass and high tone.)\\n\\nOnly thing you may want to know before purchase is you can't expect much on its noise cancelling. You can definitely hear everyone chatting around you. It's more like this: when you cover your ears, you should hear muffled noise, and the headphones will cancel the noise so you hear what you hear when you don't cover. Actually it's a bit better than that but you should expect only that much.\\nOh, one more thing, if you put this around your neck and run to catch the next train, speakers will hit your collarbone badly. It's light, but it's heavy enough to hurt.","[]","B01N7UBGGQ","B01N7UBGGQ","AFYAIORFFYYBU3DLMVGA3N2TBSBQ","2017-11-12 18:06:12.635","4","True","503"
"478341","2","Lack of support ruined this already flawed player","This player has not been able to play YouTube videos for about 6 months now. I've looked it up; google changed their API, and Sony never got off their duffs to update it. Well, guess what, I like watching YouTube videos as well as discs, and I don't want to always balance a laptop on my legs in bed to watch a YouTube video. The YouTube app was nice to use while it lasted, but this player simply does not support it anymore, and it's been a dead app for a while now. That's a loss.\\n\\nThe Netflix app is buggy, and frequent quits back to the Sony home screen when trying to play a video. That means selecting the Netflix app again, which has two very long boot screens, selecting a profile (another load screen), then clicking your way through the interface to get back to the movie or tv show's episode you were trying to watch when the app quit on you. And yes, you really do &#34;CLICK!!&#34; your way through on that remote (more on that later).\\n\\nAs for the rest of the player.........the disc reader is loud when loading, the boot-up time for the player isn't terrible but isn't great either, and the remote's buttons have an annoying loud click sound on every button. So if you're browsing through Netflix, every title you scroll through is another &#34;CLICK!!&#34; on the remote while the person next to you trying to sleep is enduring that unnecessary sound.\\n\\nTo the unit's credit, it does support the Super Audio CD format (I checked), and the remote's small power button can be programmed to power off your possibly non-Sony-branded TV (mine's a Westinghouse), making for easy powering down of both the blu-ray player and the tv.\\n\\nBut it's plagued with too many problems to keep using, like the whole unit constantly freezing up, with not even the power button on the unit powering it down, resulting it me having to unplug the device's cord down by the power strip, since there's no hard &#34;cut the power&#34; switch on the back of the unit, and the cord is hard-wired into the back of the unit, so the power cord can't be unplugged from the device end of the cord.","[]","B006U1YUW2","B006U1YUW2","AE42EAQH6S52GOI7LH654LN4JHVQ","2017-03-10 07:32:57.000","2","True","503"
"487798","2","Love it - except when I hate it.","I've been using this for just over a month now.  It looks good, the strange fabric palm rest is comfortable, it is easy to type on, and the keys feel good.  In fact, when I finally got fed up with it and switched back to my old keyboard, I really missed this one.  So what's not to like?\\n\\nThere are a couple of relatively minor annoyances with the function keys: they default to non-F-key mode.  In other words, if I want F5, I have to hit the Fn key first, then the F5 key.  Fortunately, that is a locking key, so I only have to do it once.  And the F-labels are printed so small that I can't really read them.  Easier to just memorize where the frequently-used function keys are.  But as I said, that is a minor consideration.\\n\\nThe much bigger issue is that a few times in the first few weeks, it would suddenly stop responding when I type.  I could fix that by pulling and replacing the battery to reset the keyboard.  Then I had to do that plus un-pair it from my computer (Microsoft Surface Book), and reconnect it to get it to work.  (3 or 4 times in the last week or so.)  The last straw was today when it started generating keystrokes on its own - either Windows-I (which causes Windows to pop the Settings screen up) or control-shift-I (which puts Chrome into Developer mode).  Really annoying when it happens every few seconds.\\n\\nSince I love it when it is not being infuriating, I'm going to swap it out for another one and hope for better luck.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nI've been using the replacement keyboard for a few weeks now, and I'm sorry to say that it too has started being frustrating.  It sometimes generates a long series of the same keystroke, as if the key were being held down, but more often nothing happens when I type.  Removing and reinserting the batteries fixes the problem until the next time.  A reset button, or at least a power switch, would be very handy.\\n\\nI'm afraid I'm giving up on this keyboard and going back to the Logitech wireless keyboard I had been using before.","[]","B01MFCTRZM","B01MFCTRZM","AGIRV6XTWJ7JQGNSS7PQDWQMNT6A","2017-08-07 22:24:58.868","2","True","503"
"17931","4","Works if you know what it is - NEEDS WWLAN mini-PCI-e + SIM with active account to work. SIM cards w/ adapters problematic.","This works as is intended. It needs an appropriate WWLAN card though. WWLAN cards normally are meant to be embedded inside a laptop (sometimes a mobile router). If you don't know what a WWLAN card, this will not work for you. The WWLAN card is what normally provides a laptop with mobile 3G or 4G internet - you still need to slide your SIM card into the laptop slot. What this box does is allow you take the card that would normally be embeeded in your laptop - and instead, put the card in this box and provide you with a slot to insert your SIM.\\n\\nI have found that this box becomes problematic if you don't use the regular size SIM card and instead are using a nano or micro sim with an adapter. After a couple dozen insertions of a micro/nano SIM + adapter, the box is no longer able to properly read the SIM card. I had bought two of these boxes and one went bad and I initiated a return on it, then the 2nd box went bad shortly after. However, I found they still worked if instead, I affixed a piece of tape to the bottom of the sim card (to faciliate removing it later) and just insert the card without the adapter - aligning with the pins. This is the primary reason for 4 instead of 5 stars. Upon discovering this, I cancelled the return on the first box and now use both boxes with the tape trick.\\n\\nIt does take some hacking skills to get this to work - if you are looking at this solution, you are probably aware of this. If you are uncomfortable with hacking, then you probably want to get a more out-of-the-box solution than this. This is not a box where you put your SIM card in and turn it on and it works right away.\\n\\nIn addition to this box you need a WWLAN card and an account+SIM that is compatible with the WWLAN card. The WWLAN card I used cost 8x this box and the mobile provider+SIM is an extra charge per month. Keep in mind that this actual box is a very small minority cost vs the whole solution.\\n\\nThe primary reason you would want this box is if you wanted to take your active 3G/4G service that is now tied to a specific laptop or hotspot - and be able to access it though some other means.","[]","B01J705MTC","B07X2WGRCH","AEPTHZSDHXCIYLD64CNMLEZATCNQ","2017-03-23 17:56:52.000","25","True","503"

What's in the box?:  You receive the headphones, instructions (typical quick start guide), and a USB charger (mini USB).\\n\\n2.  Set-up?:  These were quite easy to set-up.  I like to see if I can get things like this connected without using the quick-start instructions.  with these headphones, I was able to connect to my phone easily.  Once I did that, away I went.\\n\\n3.  Use?:  The connection through bluetooth was great, and no connections problems at all.  As to the headphones, these are over the ear.  The fit for me was fine.  There was no overly tight press on my head and I found these comfortable.\\n\\nThe headphones are of good, not great, build quality and looks as should be expected at this price point.  This means to me that the buttons and the overall feel is good but not overly nice.  The movement of the slides (note that these are 'retro' style so the slides are like years ago and this is part if the charm of the headphones. The top is no cushioned and the cups are not really fine 'faux leather' either.\\n\\nSound?:  These are of high quality, but not superior quality.  These are way better than Apple pods to be sure.  There is very good staging and sound balance.  In no way is the sound bad or of less quality.  In fact, I was quite surprised how warm the sound is.  So I would judge these right in line with most headphones I have tried both more inexpensive and more expensive.  Certainly, for the price point these are really really nice.\\n\\nOverall?:  For this price point and being wireless, these are terrific headphones.  The sound is quite good, the fit is pretty comfortable.  The build  quality is good and this shouldn't break part from regular use.  Connection is easy and without any issues at all.  I rate this 4 star product based on the price point.  I have tried two other headphones (though I must confess I ended up buying a more expensive pair for my main personal use), but these are quite good and I wouldn't hesitate for this price point if the style fits your expectations.","[]","B00L6S6XWO","B083MQJ4R4","AGXZ6ELCUJSWJGZ4JINSX25LWMPQ","2017-12-25 19:52:26.576","0","False","503"

However, they sounded better than just about any other headphone on the market at the time.\\n\\nThey were very musical.  Decades later, with the advent of the truly portable headphone, Koss remains a leader\\nin the business which they helped to pioneer in the early days of home Hi-Fi.\\n\\nAnd their KPH7G portable headphones are just another example of how this company can build a quality product\\nat a price point that still manages to faithfully honor the music.\\n\\nAbout a year ago I purchased a pair of Koss KSC75 headphones and have been very pleased with them.\\n\\nIn spite of their diminutive size, they are dynamic and do a credible job of conveying a musical performance.\\n\\nFor about $18, they are priced competitively.  I can say the same in regard to the KPH7G headphones,\\nwhich while not quite as detailed as the KSC75s,  still do a fine job of faithfully honoring the music; and at half\\nthe price of the KSC75.\\n\\nOne caveat here is that like all mini headphones, the KPH7G are delicate and if mishandled can be\\neasily damaged.  So common sense is a must here.  Moreover, at this price, you can purchase a few\\npairs in case you damage or even lose a pair.\\n\\nSome KPH7G owners have also stated that the headphone cushions wear out after a few months\\nof daily use. To remedy this problem, Koss sells spare foam ear cushion replacements which can be purchased in packs of six  for a nominal charge on Amazon.\\n\\nIn a day where  portable wireless devices which include headphone jacks are myriad in nature, it is a pleasure to see that the headphone has  flourished; having evolved into a tiny, lightweight, yet very competent transducer.\\n\\nThe KPH7Gs are a bargain at $10.  At the $4 and change price that this hi-fi enthusiast paid for mine, they are a steal.\\n\\nHighly recommended!","[]","B00KHA6XZE","B00KHA6XZE","AFAOXXNLH7NA2CAJOLKUG24PDEFQ","2017-04-04 08:47:48.000","0","False","503"

This track pad, while kind of convenient cause it's self-contained, is VERY touchy, and I'm always opening stuff I DON'T wanna open and dragging stuff I DON'T wanna drag, cause I CAN'T TURN OFF &#34;Tap to click&#34;. (BTW I always keep that disabled, even when I work with excellent feel trackpads, which this one is not. But it works.)\\n\\nAlso the Page UP - DOWN feature does not work in a Windows Explorer window that displays files in a List, Details or Icons view. The page up-down feature DOES work in a Word document.\\n\\nThe Backlit feature is kind of useless cause the light does NOT show the keys and letter designations, so in the dark you see a bright cutout in the shape of the keyboard but you still have no idea which keys are which.\\n\\nBut I didn't return it cause the price is fair and I can deal with it until I get something better.

I could not see any visible damage to the box or TV. I hooked it up and everything was good to go. So far the quality is just as I expected after seeing this model in the store. I've been wanting to buy the E6 for a few years and when I saw the E7 come out, I knew I had to have it. 65&#34; was my go to size considering the size of my living room. Anything bigger would have been too much for my house.\\n\\nI was using a 32&#34; LG LED TV that I got back in 2010. That one has surprisingly great picture quality, but I definitely needed something bigger to fit the new house. My old LG has always been very bright, but I did notice a lot of light bleeding and very bright black levels. With the new E7, you see almost none of that. I ran a movie which has the black letter box on the top and bottom and I thought that the black panels were the frame of my TV. Colors and clarity are amazing, but I feel that my 1080P movies are almost like a joke on a 4K TV. They look great, but I know 4K movies will look amazing. You do get some reflections, but mainly when you're watching from an angle. If you sit center to the TV, you don't really see any reflection.\\n\\nI also love the built in apps that can be downloaded straight to the TV. You have the option to use Ethernet or WiFi. As you can see from the pictures, I have a router and near the TV for all my electronics so I opted for the Ethernet option. Downloading and running the apps straight from the TV is quick and easy. Right now I'm also fully utilizing all the HDMI ports. There are only 4 which was expected from most TV's, but disappointing since I have so many devices.\\n\\nMy dad also loves TV's and is planning to buy the E7 or G7, but I beat him to it. Now he has to come to my house to justify his next purchase.  All I need is a surround sound system next. I definitely recommend this TV to anyone that is looking for OLED.

"447838","4","Great DVR, but not compatible with existing cameras","I have a small WiFi Amcrest I use as a baby monitor, and I love that thing. The quality is superb and the user interface is awesome compared to other units I used in the past. That same interface is on this DVR unit, which I was really happy about. I have an existing 8CH 720p Annke system setup in the house, with 8 720p cameras all ran to where I wanted them, so I thought maybe I could just upgrade the DVR without needing to buy the cameras; unfortunately, that's not the case.\\n\\nDVR was easy to setup, once again the Amcrest user interface is awesome and super fast interaction between phone app and DVR. That being said when I connected the Annke cameras to the DVR, I got less than stellar results. All cameras, regardless of which channel I plugged them into, showed up in B/W, with very poor video resolution. I tried your standard help desk troubleshooting tips; disconnecting/reconnecting camera, rebooting, factory reset, different cables, etc. After 2 hours of breaking my brain on this, and reading several online posts with similar experiences, I chucked it up to an incompatibility between the Amcrest DVR and my Annke cameras.\\n\\nSo, while the issues I had wasn't exactly Amcrest's fault, I can not in good conscience give this review 5 stars; I didn't &#34;love&#34; it, but did think what I did see was pretty &#34;OK&#34; (3-stars). Some users might not need cameras, but simply want to upgrade their base unit, and this unit just didn't play nice with my cameras. I was hoping to save a few hundred in camera costs, but I guess I'll have to buy the Amcrest 16CH Camera/DVR kit is I want to upgrade my home setup. Come on daily deals...\\n\\nUPDATE: 9-June-2017 - Bump score from 3 to 4 stars. Despite 3-stars showing up as something being &#34;OK&#34; on the consumer side, all kinds of things are triggered on the vendor side by Amazon, enough so that I start getting emails wondering what went wrong. Nothing went wrong with this order, it functioned as designed.

"94914","5","For $35, you will be hard pressed to be disappointed.","This is a nifty little digital microscope. What I was looking for was something to do a little extra magnification for videos for YouTube. The camera on my phone can magnify to a similar degree, but getting it to focus, not shake while I'm holding it, and not overexpose when I zoom in is extremely difficult. So I saw this little dodad, and thought, &#34;For $35? Sure. Why not?&#34;\\n\\nI gotta say, I am superbly happy with this thing. I thought the base was just going to be some kind of cheap mat that would be just barely strong enough to hold the microscope, and I'd end up needing to find my own mounting solution. Nope, hard plastic. Has a great feel to it. The suction cup at the base of the arm has a lever to create the suction. The microscope end of the arm has two little dots that enter holes in the side of the microscope, and they do a great job of keeping it in place while I'm focusing or adjusting the brightness of the LEDs.\\n\\nIf I have one complaint here, it's that it is hard to finely adjust the brightness of the LEDs. It's like the dial sticks, and then you put enough pressure on it and it finally spins further than you want it to go. But I can work around it with very little effort. The focus is the grey section of the microscope. That is a damn pleasure to work with, and can be finely adjusted without issue.\\n\\nAnd finally the very best feature about this microscope. From my computer's perspective, it's just a USB camera. So I just plug it into my computer, and like all USB cameras under Linux, the thing just works. Plugable did send me an email when this was shipped out. It looks like they generally recommend just working with your favorite Linux distro's USB camera drivers to make it work.

I was disappointed that non-PWM fans were supplied, but after turning it on, I found the case is still nearly silent.  At 40&#34; away, you can barely hear it.  Added an Icy Dock 2 to 3 bay in the top and I can now house 11 drives\\n\\nMinus 1 star for poor design.\\n  - Drive cage traps heat, especially at the bottom.  The intention was to blow air over and under drives, but there isn't enough space for air to get through easily\\n  - As another reviewer of the DS380 cage noted, you will need to drill holes in the back for air flow. 6 3/8&#34; holes (2 above opening, 4 below)\\n  - Air flow design causes air blown at drives to completely bypass drive cage.  Had to add something between metal that fans mounted to and cage to force air into cage\\n  - 24 screws need to be removed to get that cage out of the bay!  And the face plate has to come off too!\\n  - PSU placement means that 20&#34; long cables are too short to reach top of motherboard.  You may need an extender if your motherboard's ATX connector is along the top edge of case\\n  - Drive trays are tricky to get locked into place, you have to wiggle the tray until both sides click\\n  - No place to mount an internal drive in spite of having plenty of space all over.\\n\\nMinus 1 star for lack of attention to details\\n  - As another reviewer stated, the caps on backplane move! I had to use hot glue at the base of each cap to provide stability, something that many manufacturers have done for decades!\\n  - Screws for 2.5&#34; drives require #1 phillips screw driver while everything else works fine with #2\\n  - Keys supplied do not have a reference number in the event you need to buy replacements\\n  - Bottom fan vent is blocked by the drive cage, so no extra fans can be added\\n\\nI would recommend this case, but the builder had better be prepared to compensate for these flaws.","[]","B01MA6NJE8","B07MWVDKBR","AENPAN6PRXTLQYVHYUW4GRPFUESQ","2017-05-16 02:58:58.000","7","True","503"
"518283","3","Not bad at all.","This Nobsound is a very good compliment for anyone needing that extra bass/treble at an instant. I have paired this PreAmp to the Little Dot MK2 and it has added a little extra driving power as well.The Nobsound is a equipped with two blue LED below the tube to give it a cool blue glow, i don't care for it but their there. The tubes also supply a very thin yellowish color.  When i first fired up the Nobsound, both LED blue lights came on and stayed on for about 10 minutes, then the right LED went out. The left LED stayed on. At about the 3rd day the LED that was refusing to turn on came to life and has stayed lit up to current...go figure. The chinese stock tubes are garbage causing the same output sound as the Little Dot driver tubes (front smaller ones) the treble was that of a metallic smashing sound, it did tame down a little after burn in but i still replaced them for the exact same as the one i replaced the Little Dot MK2 7 pins Jan5654W by Riverstone Audio via Amazon for 19.95 for a matched pair. Now they all match. THe treble is very responsive, pretty smooth sounding and good. The Bass on the other hand thickens up to 3 O'clock on the dial, passed 3 O'clock sort of bleeds into the mids thickening the vocals a little. I like 2 O'clock just fine for certain songs. I have not tested all my headphones with this setup as i have way to many cans. This review was with the Hifiman HE400i. I've noticed that the VOLUME set on the Nobsound at 3 O'clock tames down the treble as opposed to max volume which will supply more treble...hmmm,? Anyway not bad for 45.00. I will keep it for the times being. If your wondering whether this combo drives the HE400i with sufficient power as it stands....it does not. It sounds pretty great up to 2oclock on the Little Dot MK2 volume dial. After that it distorts. However with the Grados RS2e with the Geekria flat Ear cushions, the sound, bass impact, treble and mids sound phenomenal!! It like a match made in heaven. Maybe the He400i will improve when i swap out the power tubes on the LD mk2 when they arrive , russian made.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FyUWN6aiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FyUWN6aiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FyUWN6aiL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01NBM7K8L","B01NBM7K8L","AH32IQRR6P33WUKJ2YVCJURW3NBA","2017-08-16 22:36:39.598","2","True","503"
"220214","3","Looks AMAZING! 5/5. Barely cuts it past that.","It. Looks. Sexy. I ordered the brown leather case. It's about the same color as a leather basketball. The leather has a soft feel to it so it's not hard or feel like it's going to start to crumple if you look at it wrong. The stitching looks really good, the edges are well cut and finished. I mean, visually it's truly stunning. As I was writing this review someone came back here and said &#34;That case is NICE!&#34; So it definitely has ascetics going for it. As I stated earlier, the feel is very soft. As far as how it looks and feels I give it a solid 5.\\n\\nThe magnet portion of the I feel is pretty good. The magnet holds in place well. If I turn it upside down it doesn't feel like the tablet will fall out. So if you were to drop it while in this sleeve i don't think your tablet would go flying across the floor.\\n\\nMy issue is that it doesn't feel very protective AT ALL. I recognize this is a sleeve and not a case, but most sleeves have SOME sort of protection. It's not full protection like a case, but they usually have some sort of foam/padding/cushion on the inside for at least a little bit of protection. This literally has almost nothing. On the side where the flap closes there feels to be some sort of cardboard which probably houses the magnetic portion so the case will hold shut. Other than that, on the back side, theres literally nothing. It's simply a piece of leather. No felt. No &#34;velvet&#34;, no foam. No neoprene. Not even a piece of cardboard. There's NOTHING. For that I have it a 2/5.\\n\\nSo in conclusion, I like how it looks, I like how it feels, I like how it's put together. I like...LOVE all three of those qualities. But as far as a functional sleeve, it passes that test minimally. If all you literally want is a sleeve. Don't care about any sort of protection. Just want to keep the device from getting scratches, then this is your choice. But if you want ANY sort of protection in the rare unforseen circumstance that it slips out of your hand while you're walking then do NOT get this case.","[]","B01LYN90PJ","B01LYN90PJ","AE4OW5GLGRSWVSDS3ZZFYJI7EDGQ","2017-01-03 17:11:21.000","0","True","503"

It also mostly works(when it isn't crashing), and is fairly cheap, so, given the price I'd probably rate it in low to mid 2 star territory in my book,  were it not for the fact that it is an &#34;Includes Special Offers&#34; device, but isn't sold as such.  In other words, they don't tell you that it puts advertisements on the home page and prime pages, and there is no way to turn them off.\\n\\nIn addition to the unadvertised inclusion of- advertisements on menus, it crashes daily, needs regular rebooting, loses sound, and won't support surround sound in Plex ( which the roku 3 actually *does* do, so even the one advantage over a several year old roku is questionable), not that it can run plex reliably without crashing.\\n\\nAlso, the &#34;Amazon Focus&#34; is much more annoying in practice than I expected it to be.  Since voice search always returns prime options, and the main menu is prime, you have to go to the home screen (with it's advertisements) and use the remote wheel to navigate to the netflix app every time.  In theory I believe that you can load netflix with voice remote, but that is clunky and causes crashes and sound drops like crazy.\\n\\nPros:\\n-cheap\\n-good image quality\\n-remote pairs well with the unit ( no pushing buttons 5 times at different angles)\\n-small footprint\\n\\ncons:\\n-Includes Special Offers, but doesn't tell you it does that!!!!\\n-needs to be rebooted at least once a day\\n-freezes up regularly\\n-sound  will drop when switching between menus (about a 5-10% chance per menu switch!)","[]","B00ZV9RDKK","B075X8471B","AH5D5WLLM2NXFTKGR2XWL6YGBKMA","2017-09-30 11:20:57.926","0","True","503"
"568533","5","The Best Man Bag","I spend many hours checking out potential Amazon purchases. Many call me nuts in that regard. But this is the first time I've felt compelled to review a purchase.  I found this bag quite by accident after having to return another &#34;man bag&#34;, which had good Amazon reviews but just didn't work for me the way I expected. Thank you Amazon for your seamless return process. So, feeling rather defeated after having spent so much time picking it out, I once again browsed through a seemingly endless number of small bags on Amazon, none being what I wanted. So, I searched online for a Man Bag review video, and &#34;boom&#34; up popped the Man Bag Dammit. The name itself was enough to get my attention, along with the USA Made label. One word. Perfect. For me. Not too big, nor too small. Quality everything. Waxed canvas, sturdy inch-wide shoulder strap with rugged hardware, and stay closed zippers. The hand strap is also nicely designed and constructed. Doesn't stick up too high like on other bags I've seen. The design of the bags &#34;D-ring&#34; shoulder strap connectors on the top rear of the bag makes it hang tight to my body, unlike on-top connected straps on bags I've owned which sometimes made it hard to open the top zipper. The heavy canvas material also molds itself to my body nicely. There is more room inside this bag than I expected. I prefer not having lots of small storage places such as for pens, credit cards, keys and such. The bag-wide single internal zippered compartment is just right for my wallet, keys and other loose items I don't want bouncing around. Best of all is the external zippered compartment that fits my iPhone 7 Plus. Inside I have plenty of room for my iPad Mini and Kindle Voyage. And more. Sunglasses for example. As I've gotten older and wiser, &#34;fear&#34; sometimes places its grip around me. Fear of losing my wallet or phone for example, caused me to put them in my usually worn cargo pants leg-pocket secured by Velcro, But after getting my wallet or phone out, habit made me put it back in a relative unsecured and crowded front pants pocket. No more. Hence the Man Bag Dammitt. Just buy his thing! It's great!","[]","B0153W7C4G","B0153W7C4G","AGLGS546KWZ3Z23UUJTEXBLHOCIA","2017-06-03 18:51:03.000","1","True","503"
"465900","2","very difficult to configure, then quit working","I have only had this camera about a week, but after overcoming Sunba's bonehead default configuration, I finally got it configured and running. I am very pleased with the picture and optics, but control and configuration software is both difficult and confusing. Also, as usual with electronics made overseas, the little manual that comes with the camera is laughable, and useless.  Additionally, the camera is very heavy, which presents mounting difficulties. Even with the great optics, using this camera is tainted by the pathetic configuration problems.\\n\\nWhat is that pathetic default configuration? Well, Sunba preloads the camera with a default network ip address. Which might be fine and dandy, if your camera network is using the same subnet as the preconfigured address in the camera, but if your network is configured for a different subnet then you have to figure out how to get around it, and for the average person I suspect it would be very difficult to do (I had to configure an old router with the same subnet, and then configure the camera for dynamic ip assignment). After getting the camera on the subnet it wants, then you will at least get the camera to respond. However, you're still not finished with the b.s, because, after you get the camera connected to the correct subnet, you have to download a configuration app from Sunba. Oh, but that's not so easy either, because this app sets off the firewall, and virus checking software on the computer, which won't let it be downloaded unless your firewall and virus blocking software is turned off or disabled, and that has to be done on very computer you plan on using to monitor this camera with. .....  For a camera that costs as much as this one, it should be way easier to setup and use, but once you get through the b.s., it's a pretty good camera, so far anyway.\\n\\nUPDATE: I am returning this camera. It's a total pos! I've been configuring and using PTZ cameras for over ten years, and this was the worst experience I've had yet. The camera is very expensive, very large, very heavy, very difficult to configure, and it only worked for a few days ...I give it two stars, instead of one, because it does have amazing optics, but what good are great optics if the rest of the camera sucks to the point that the optics cannot be used ...","[]","B01HTYW2Q4","B096DQ93QT","AHXL4RVTV7WSPEKUGKWCIKY45XFQ","2017-07-18 13:37:59.861","2","True","503"
"654792","4","I'd like to start by saying the amazon app store is ...","Mine arrived with 2 dead pixels, and a scratch on the screen. I'm not going to try to warrantee, because by the time it becomes an issue I'll have bought the HD model, But I'm not going to take that into account for the review. There is always a chance for defects, and of course it was ordered during the busiest season.\\n I'd like to start by saying the amazon app store is worthless. No youtube app, Just a bookmark to take you to youtube in the browser, which is painfully slow, and all of the apps just seem lacking. There are of course games, and the most common apps like facebook, and instagram, But for the most part it feels like there could be more.\\n So, Do yourself a huge favor and look up how to install the google playstore. There are simple instructions online, and though amazon probably isn't happy about it, You will have a much better experience. You can install ANY android app, and it works the way it should- After all, fire OS is just a re-skinned version of android.\\n The camera is... Well, It's not great. The speaker is in probably the worst location imaginable, and doesn't produce the greatest quality sound anyway. But, What could you expect for the price?\\n Battery life, actually, isn't that bad. I mostly watch videos, and use it for facebook, and scrolling through the internet while in the garage and I can go just about all day the way I've used it. You may have a different experience.\\n Wifi range, Is surprisingly really good. My phone and laptop struggle to stay connected outside of the house, but this tablet does a really good job.\\nThe screen, Well, There's a reason I said that I will probably be upgrading to the HD. The color reproduction just seems off, and there is really more to be desired if you are using it to watch a movie or videos frequently.\\n Even though I sound like I'm being very harsh on this, I really do like it. It does everything I need it to, and it does it well. I feel as though the faults I've brought up are things I would have liked to know before I received this, even still, I don't think I would have made a different decision. It's great for what it is, with a price that's better than most all other options.","[]","B00TSUGXKE","B010BWYDYA","AEXQULXHZQUUYFAM3XPIE434X3YA","2017-01-03 06:58:24.000","0","True","503"
"593325","4","Gets loud, super portable, easy to pair, seems very durable.","Cons:\\nIt doesn't float. That's about it. Subsequent models have been made that do float and to the credit of UE they do include some ridiculous blow up floatation thing that looks like an inner tube for your speaker. That's my only reason for a one star rating. They made this thing super durable and even WATERPROOF but didn't make it so that it would float? So it'll keep playing all the way to the bottom of the river/ocean. Great.\\n\\nThe other con that I'd mention but it's a slight one is that the charging port is very difficult to reach and thus you cannot charge it with very many cables except the one that came with it. I've found a few others that I have that work but it doesn't make sense that they would make the charging port so slim so that 95% of all chargers cannot get to it without bending the tip or breaking the speaker.\\n\\nPros:\\nSounds great. I'm no audiophile by a long shot but I do detect the difference between highs and lows. I'm familiar with the strength of base, etc. So When I say it sounds great, it does. It's meant for traveling outside and taking on the go (which is what I got it for) and it does that well.\\n\\nVery durable. That goes without saying because if you are looking for this product you are probably looking for a product that you can take on the go and not have to worry about it falling and shattering. This is that speaker. I will mention that UE makes a lot of these speakers though and some will like the larger and more cylindrical speakers that do the same thing. I really like the conical shape of this one and the smaller size than it's peers.\\n\\nVery portable. The bungee strap on the back and the 9 hour battery life make it so that it can easily be taken on a 4 wheeling trip through the forest or anywhere out in nature and have a good speaker with you. I went hiking with it and it stayed on the whole time. I really liked that I could hear my notification on it.\\n\\nI hope this helps! I just got it for Christmas so I'll do an update later after I've had it for a few weeks or months to update any issues or things to know about the device.","[]","B01FFV59PY","B01FMWDA66","AGATUG6BQ6GNLFSOUNMZFQL3SZGA","2017-12-27 20:15:53.720","0","False","503"
"406919","4","Amazing laptop-like device for those that want portability","I'm a college student who commute to campus so I was really looking for a device that would fit my needs as a student while being portable, thin, and light. The Surface Pro 4 checked all those requirements. The first thing you'll notice about this is how beautiful it is. The magnesium alloy not only looks good, but feels amazing in the hand. The device itself is light and feels great holding it as a tablet. Even with the type cover attached, the weight is still very much manageable. The screen is among the best out there, bright, sharp, and very color accurate. The device is fast enough for your daily needs and more. Don't let its size fool you. This device is more than capable enough of doing what you need to accomplish. You can even play some light games on here if you want to. Windows Hello on here is super accurate and fast. Don't bother buying the type cover with the fingerprint reader. Facial recognition to unlock is just as good. Tablet mode is superb, especially since i5 and i7 models include an excellent pen.\\n\\nJust a few downsides:\\n-Windows 10 is still a little buggy on this device. Sometimes the camera will fail to start when using Windows Hello.\\n-You only have one USB port on this device. That can cause issues when you want to use two USB ports at the same time. For example, I'm using a USB mouse but sometimes I want to plug in my flashdrive to transfer files. This means I have to take out my mouse to use my flashdrive which can be a pain. You can always use the type cover touch pad or a bluetooth mouse, or even just a buy a Surface Dock, but for the sake of convenience, I would have preferred Microsoft put in at least two USB ports on this device. A USB-C port would have been even better.\\n-Battery is quite poor, especially on the higher end models with the i7, which I have. I average about 4 hours with normal use on this which is a big downside for someone who is on the go a lot and cannot plug the device on an outlet.\\n\\nBut overall, I would recommend this to people looking for a laptop with an emphasis on portability and utility without sacrificing performance (if you think you won't have the cash to pay for a full price Surface Pro 5 which will come out soon, then get this)","[]","B01605ZRBK","B01605ZRBK","AEYO74PNYOE4KN65F2DCWJJGW64Q","2017-04-03 23:07:52.000","3","True","503"
"982674","5","Great Earbuds!","I love these wireless earbuds! I have had Absolutely no issues with these earsbuds. They were easy to pair and are easy to use. I did read that there was dissatisfaction with the fact that the bud beeps when there is a voicemail waiting and you don't listen to it right away. But what I do is press the button on the bud once for a second, the bud beeps and it stops responding to the voicemail in your box. It's really cool that it pairs with a second earbud, which again, is easy to do (following the directions) and then the buds will tell you which earbud is the right and left channel. Then you can switch ears accordingly. Only one earbud responds to calls. If you get a call and don't want to answer it you just push the button on the bud twice really fast and the message goes to voicemail. Push the button once and you can answer th call. I've not had any problems with the caller hearing me but once and then I turn the bud about a quarter turn and then there's no problem being heard. I try to put the bud in so that the button is horizontal in my ear. The Sound is great. I do wish I could skip songs by pushing the earbud button but you can't. That's my only issue, which is not a huge issue for me. It just would be nice. I love my gold gilded earbuds! They're Beautiful! And they pop right in the charger magnetically. The tube charger can recharge the buds a couple of times. I've not actually run into any problems with having to charge my buds more than once as I'm not that busy on my phone but I do use them a lot listening to music and still have no problem with having to recharge them.i just make sure I charge the charger when I get home, which charges both bud and charger. I've been looking for something like this for a long time and could not be happier. I also like that you buy them separately. Not everyone wants or needs two of them. Lastly, I used them on my recent trip to D.C. For the women's march and with both buds in, I could not hear the roar of the plane engine, just like Bose noise canceling headphones. I also don't have any problems with them staying In my ears. They do come wi 3 size buds.

"916346","5","By far,  THE BEST!","By far this is the best GoPro ever. I wasn't sure if this camera would be a big enough upgrade to the Hero5 Black. It's a HUGE upgrade. Everything is better with the Hero6 and it's noticeable right away. Not only are you getting double the frame rates with 4K/60 and 1080/240, but everything just looks so much better! Stability is amazing and the color is outstanding. The GoPro color is vibrant and beautiful. If you color grade in post like I do, and prefer the flat profile, the Hero6 gives you so much more to work with compared to other similar cameras including the Hero5.\\nGoPro smartly got rid of the narrow and medium fov and instead added the ability to ZOOM. Essentially it's the same as using these modes but you have much more flexibility in how close or far you want the sensor to crop, plus you can see exactly what the effect will be as you adjust the zoom/fov.\\nVoice activation to turn on the camera and start recording is a big plus (firmware update is required and available now with the GoPro app) along with all of the usual voice activations found in the Hero5 cameras.\\nAll of the features of the Hero5 are also found on the Hero6. Waterproof, LCD back screen, GPS, RAW photo, manual ISO and shutter, stereo and wind resistance plus Protune audio, auto cloud updating, Quik Story, Bluetooth/Wi-Fi connectivity, and selective spot metering/ light adjustment. The difference is, Hero6 does all of these things better. A lot better.\\nThe touch screen is more responsive. ISO can be set to max 100 with the shutter on auto. Wi-Fi connection and transfer is significantly faster. Audio is clear and more accurate. Light balance and low light are much better. If you don't have the ability to edit RAW photos the new HDR gives rich blacks and brighter whites than the Hero5 Black WDR.\\nIf you are thinking about getting an action cam that can also be used as an everyday shooter, this is the camera to get. If you are on the fence about upgrading from your Hero5, it's worth it. If you are still using a Hero4 or even a Hero3+, now is the time to upgrade, you truly don't know what you're missing and won't regret getting this camera.\\nIn short, I am impressed!","[]","B074X5WPC5","B08R3D8R9W","AFXN6G5GVFGIREUEZ7LJY2RVVC2Q","2017-09-30 08:52:36.836","158","False","503"

After many positive reviews I decided on the Logitech MX Master. It was also very expensive for a mouse at $100 but I decided if it was good then it was worth it.\\n\\nPros. - The software allows you to customize to liking many functions and regular updates are great. The Gesture button allows you to expand these functions even more. It's got lots of buttons and great customization. It's got a nice rechargeable battery that lasts a good amount of time.\\n\\nCons. - The tracking on this mouse is pretty horrible for a $100 mouse. It can't track on anything besides a track pad. The scrolling is by far the most part as it appears to be tied to how well the mouse tracks movement. For the mouse movement you can get by and after a while you get used to it, but the scrolling almost never works it's that bad. Everything else is great.\\n\\nDealbreaker - LIFESPAN & Customer service. I've had this mouse for about a year. I don't game, I don't do professional work, it's purpose was for casual and leisure use. I have the latest iPhone X, an iPad, an Ultrabook for school and a Mac at work, so I barely even spend time using it so the fact that it no longer even works is ridiculous to me. The Gesture button was the first thing to go, after 6 months it stoped making that firm click sound and then the button no longer would work, THEN THE WHOLE MOUSE STOPPED WORKING AT ALL.\\n\\nI had to pull out my old mouse which I purchased in 2012 so I could use my computer again. The Logitech MX Master lasted me 12 MONTHS. I even e-mailed Logitech support to see if they could repair it or see if they could do anything but no response. It's been 2 weeks and now the great MX is just collecting dust. I seriously thought their firmware would eventually get better and they would fix the tracking/scrolling to get me by, then I planned to purchase  their new mouse once the MX would no longer hold charge but now that's all ridiculous. How could they make a product with these issues, slap a $100 price tag and leave their customers out to dry after just one year of light use?","[]","B00TZR3WRM","B00TZR3WRM","AFGONIYQGTMOLRMNGZPHUOB6NZ6A","2017-11-20 02:57:29.111","0","True","503"
"244080","5","Greatly exceeded my expectations as a practically useful device","I understand the Harmony Hub as a general device control tool that comes with IR and Wifi out of the box. Originally bought it for a vanity feature to turn on my TV via Alexa. My wife weakly approved the purchase when there was a discount and of course I jumped on her vague approval to immediately make the purchase. The hub greatly exceeded my expectations and here's why.\\n\\nI have an old Samsung TV and Apple TV gen 1. Also an old sound bar. Together, they form a 3 remote circle of agony. Turn on the TV with the TV remote or sound bar remote then navigate with the Apple TV remote. Volume control had to be done via the sound bar's remote. After setting up a harmony activity with the sound bar, TV and Apple TV selected, the remote smartly assigned volume controls on the companion remote to the sound bar and navigation to the Apple TV. All this worked without custom configuration, I liked that I now have a fully functioning remote for my Apple TV watching habits. On the flip side, you can't do customize most buttons on the remote.\\n\\nAlso, the activity became an integrator with my Hue lights. I setup a scene, aptly named couched potato where it dimmed all the Philips Hue lights (yes it does color and brightness selection too) to the right levels and turned off other lights. Yay!\\n\\nMy main gripe is that the software can be better. The UI is clean but works in a pretty clunky way (updating activities take an awkward amount of time) and the initial setup is pretty frustrating. Most of the time, I use Harmony with Alexa. A lot of people are skeptical about voice control with valid concerns. I am a convert because voice is a simple interface to getting things done without having to deal with bad UIs of hardware makers pretending to have cool apps.\\n\\nAlso, I just realized that even if you bought the extender for Z-wave / Zigbee, you still need to get hubs for a lot of smart home systems to work. It's kinda sad because I was hoping that the Harmony can replace the frivolous hubs that manufacturers force on us.\\n\\nKeep making the integrations better, the Harmony has potential to be a star product!\\n\\nI am now hoping that it will work with fans in summer and I can tell Alexa to turn them on :P","[]","B00N3RFC4G","B00O4RRHP6","AHXV4WSMOJL3UFNQDC5QMSP2QSXA","2017-03-28 04:38:34.000","0","False","503"
"437844","4","Good lens ... but quality control issues evident","I have both this Helios 44-2 58mm lens and the Carl Zeiss [Jena] lens it was copied from - the Biotar 58mm. Both are M42 screw mount used on my Pentax bayonet film camera (with Japanese Pentax-made M42 adapter). The Zeiss lens, despite being from the early 1960s, is a superb performer and a go-to always in my bag. The Soviet/Russian Helios series, of which the 44-2 was the last in production and thus the newest, copied the Biotar optical design with a few small differences: namely, the Helios has an unusual and unique bokeh which the Zeiss lacks. The Zeiss is far far far sharper and altogether better built but the Helios' qualities of swirly bokeh and softness make it stand out as an excellent lens on its own\\n.\\nI compare the Helios to the Biotar not only because of pertinent historical lineage but to compare manufacturing quality control.\\n\\nIssue: My Helios lens screw mount thread depth is ever so slightly off... so, when fully screwed into my camera, infinity as marked on the lens is not truly infinity, due to this factory error. For a true infinity in focus via the viewfinder, I need to focus the lens at slightly /before/ the marker arrow.\\n\\nNot a big deal - especially factoring the low cost of the Helios - but the added movement when I quickly need the lens exactly at infinity detracts from its usefulness. So, for that reason, I keep this lens for portrait work - when I very rarely need to go to infinite focus.\\n\\nAgain, I think this issue is more quality control at the factory than one endemic to the Helios lens design. Some specimens will be otherwise flawless and others, like mine, will have a small flaw. Given the nature, in my experience, of buying Soviet-made lenses from the former eastern bloc, I may be lucky next time and get a perfect lens or be unlucky and get a flawed, even if slightly, specimen.\\n\\nOverall, my experience has been great though, being that I am getting (nearly) flawless lenses, direct copies of Zeiss optical designs, at bargain prices allowing certain looks and hence photos I would have never been able to get otherwise at this point in my photographic timeline.","[]","B00Y2S1NE8","B00Y2S1NE8","AGSZ4NNBKFSUV6YJFUZUL2WEMNGQ","2017-08-19 06:02:33.163","0","True","503"
"358665","3","Mediocre","These cameras are really cute and neat and I'm glad they're coming back into today's times. However, this camera doesnt work like I think it should. I have a love-hate relationship with it. Last year, a friend of mine had one of these and took a picture of me and my other friend. It was amazing and I've really wanted one ever since. By the time I got around to buying one, they had come out with the Instax 9, which I figured had to be better than the 8 because aren't all updates better? So I bought this one. I leave for college soon so I really wanted one so I can take tons of cute little pictures. When I got it, I used up a pack of film taking pictures at the beach and of my cats and selfies, and they only turned out &#34;ok.&#34; In comparison to the picture my friend took on her instax 8, they suck. The quality just seems a lot lower; the details and clarity just aren't there. I am not expecting perfect quality photos, but my standards are raised as I am comparing the pictures I have taken to the amazing one she took. Even compared to a review on here where a lady's camera was defective, the part of the picture I could see looked better than mine.  Some pictures turn out somewhat better than others, but none of them, I would say, are super good. The film is so expensive, I feel like I have wasted my money and picture opportunities. Although the Instax 9 came with a more selfie-friendly update, I think you should use the selfie option as a last resort. I think I will be returning this camera as I think it's just a waste of money for mediocre photos. Had I not had a comparison picture, I would probably be loving this thing. I do love the pictures I have taken because even though they're not excellent, I like the old fashion vibe and nastalga I get from holding and looking at them. This is such an awesome device, I just wish it lived up to my expectations. I think I am going to purchase another to see if it's just my camera or the Instax 9's overall, and if I find it is the Instax 9's, I might purchase an 8. I love these cameras and I'm going to try everything I can to keep one! I will update my review as I travel through this journey of discovery.","[]","B06WWBTB3G","B08GDRCCPK","AEHVOQQKEJLA46YIQDML3OHM4VRA","2017-08-03 01:29:08.084","49","True","503"

We're happy with the sound and picture, and setting the TV up for Roku, Amazon Video, Youtube, HBOGo, and Time Warner's TWC (now Spectrum) app was super easy.  With the TWC app installed, we're cable free, and can move this TV to any room in the house in case we need a second screen for a football party, or want a TV in the guest room or whatever.\\n\\nMixed: The remote is quite small and doesn't have number buttons, which is an adjustment if you're used to a standard TV. It also doesn't have a headphone jack, which is a disappointment for Roku users. The wifi is weak, and we had problems maintaining a Netflix connection or a TWC app connection while the TV was in an entertainment center.  (Oddly, Amazon Video worked flawlessly.)  There is no ethernet port, so if you want wired connection, you will need to use a USB adapter, which then takes up the USB port.\\n\\nSome fixes that brought this up to 4 stars (really 5 except that I needed to do the fixes in the first place).\\n\\n- Once you update your TV operating system to 7.5, you can install a remote app on your iOS or Android phone, and the phone will work as a headphone remote!  (In other words, you plug your headphones into your phone, then can watch TV without bothering other people, which is one of the great features of the new Roku boxes).\\n\\n- There are a bunch of internet discussions with proposed fixes for the wifi, ranging from turning off ping activity to just moving your wifi router. We tried cutting out wifi altogether, with [[ASIN:B00484IEJS this USB to ethernet adapter]] and [[ASIN:B00AWRUICG this powerline data adapter]] to get the signal from the TV to our router through our power lines. That mostly worked, but was enough of a pain to keep up that we actually hooked a Roku unit to the TV via HDMI port. A regular Roku has had no network or buffering issues, so we're basically down to using this as a dumb TV.","[]","B00UB9UJFQ","B00X3TUHWG","AGTDFTKWEUPJFPBOSV6JRHSCIKYQ","2017-01-09 17:09:11.000","1","True","503"

The system comes with 8 small diameter cables with cat6 connector at one end and micro hdmi connector at the other end. The 8 cables are 98 feet (2 ea), 82 feet (4 ea), and 51 feet (2 ea). I built a patch panel for cat6 cables on an exterior wall, ran the camera cables through the wall to the attic and to the cameras mounted under the eaves around the house. From the patch panel, I connected 5 foot patch cables to the NVR.  The system works perfectly. I have made several video clips of recorded scenes, very simple process.  The PoE system was the best Zmodo of the 3 I have owned.\\n\\nUpdate:1/10/2018\\nOne camera was causing &#34;video lost&#34;.

All the bits I needed were available on Amazon.\\n\\nUpdate 05/29/2018\\nSix months after purchase and 2 of the cameras have lost night vision capability. Daytime works fine and if I place an IR light source next to the camera, it works fine. I can hear the relay clicking to light the IR LEDs but the LEDs do not light up. I have cut and rewired all the cables with crimp connections as explained about as the micro USB connections failed. I have all the cameras on 100 foot cables.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QGF+1NoYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QGF+1NoYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QGF+1NoYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RZZPfk2bL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RZZPfk2bL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RZZPfk2bL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01KZJ3T4E","B07KGP8QJQ","AGWCWUCYSGLU26CKWV6T5N45TZ2Q","2017-12-11 12:39:25.039","6","True","503"

The tendency is no good though: APC made what they call a &#34;new model&#34; to this one, model 425VA which according to specs does not allow users to replace battery but only done in service centers! Imaging to drive around to find a service center or pay double shipment to replace battery?  They surely are heading to force buyers buy new UPS when battery dies.\\nSo far 350VA model is a blessing.\\nHere is comparison with another popular brand CyberPower CP350  :\\nAPC is almost twice larger and heavier. APC' battery is almost twice larger. So , what does it tell you about the amount of charge?\\nIndeed if APC claims no more than 350VA, then CyberPower 350 model cannot have that much charge as both batteries made of the same type: SLA and the charge is proportional to a volume of acid.\\nAPC charges the battery any time the unit is connected to the outlet regardless whether it is ON or OFF.\\nCyberPower does not charge battery if the unit is OFF... beware: if you turn it off when in thunderstorm , and left it OFF for some time (as I did), you are for a big surprise: your battery is dead!  Why? Because CyberPower does not charge battery when in OFF position (why not? OFF is for the output, not for input)  and at the same time CyberPower DRAINS your battery through internal circuitry even though your equipment receptacles are OFF !\\nNow you are for another surprise: your CyberPower UPS discharged your battery and you have hard time to find a replacement... not on Amazon. I found it on internet for $25 + shipping! Bought it once.... then killed battery once again... decided to replace with APC and stop this nonsense...\\nBTW: a replacement battery for this APC unit is $15 here on Amazon...\\nAt the time of this writing difference in price between the two is about $5.00...\\nThere are other technical details which make APC truly fully functional UPS while CyberPower does not do, but this review is getting too big...have to cut short...\\n\\nMy Conclusion:\\nbuy this and if you need more power - get few of these while APC makes them...","[]","B001985SWW","B001985SWW","AHTU7VNSWFOPHLLNJOI4NCF3O3XA","2017-02-11 18:56:21.000","2","True","503"
"734361","5","This Teleconverter is FANTASTIC!","I had bought a Nikon 300mm F/4 (Fresnel) some months back, because I was looking for an ultra-sharp, long-reach lens - but I didn't want to haul around a monster like the Tamron or Sigma 150-600mm due to the weight and size. After spending months agonizing over my choice, I finally went - as I said - with the Nikon.  However, prior to buying the Nikon, I had strategized that the ONLY way I was going to be happy with this lens (regardless of performance) was if I could extend it to a similar reach for the Tamron or Sigma.  As you can imagine, this was quite an expenditure AND investment of my time.\\n\\nSo, the Nikon came in, and had stellar performance on both my D750 and D7100. I was very pleased, indeed. :)\\n\\nThen I bought this teleconverter, mounted it, and did some tests.\\n\\nThe first thing I realized was that I needed to do some auto-focus fine tuning - introducing the TC-14E had made that apparent, even with an F/5.6 aperture.  Once I did that, my focus tests were spot on, and I could do some quality tests.\\n\\nSimply put - I cannot find the SLIGHTEST meaningful difference in quality and clarity - even pixel-peeping - between the 300 with and without the TC-14E. Nor did the TC-14E introduce any observable chromatic aberrations as well!\\n\\nIn other words - I got the reach (now 420mm on my D750 and 630mm on my D7100) by adding a small amount of weight and raising the wide-open F-stop from F/4 to F/5.6.\\n\\nStupendous - this lens and TC combination is PERFECT.\\n\\nI can't speak for other Nikon lenses using the TC-14E, but I can tell you that the 300 and the 1.4 are so good together, I just don't ever take it off. :)\\n\\nSo if you're on the fence for this, and you're running a Nikon 300mm Fresnel, don't hesitate - the results (once you've tuned the combo) are 100% worth it!","[]","B00KBC1WUY","B00KBC1WUY","AGPZ6FTMQ5OT3L6U5PMSYHCXKPUQ","2017-03-24 18:56:09.000","37","True","503"

However, having a LG SB8 sound bar, and wanting surround sound, I figure... what the heck it's ~$200 loss at worst for a pair of speakers.\\n\\nI purchased a TP-Link Powerline (look it up on Amazon:  AV500, with dual Ethernet ports) just to be &#34;safe&#34;.  After setting up the Powerline at the main router and the remote module near the H5, I plugged the H5 into the Powerline.\\n\\nBoom!  Instant wired internet connection.\\n\\nThe Music Flow app took a bit to figure out, but to be totally honest, setup was not very difficult.  Read the instructions, push correct buttons when you need to, and I've had no issues pairing up the pair of H5 with my LG SB8 Soundbar.\\n\\nWhen in music playback mode on my iPhone, it sounds great paired with my Soundbar!!  When playing without the Soundbar (which has the bass module), the sound is adequate but not exceptional.\\n\\nWhen the H5 is playing in theater mode as remote satellite speakers, the overall sound volume is lower... it's not as loud as if it's playing music.  I think LG enters some theater sound algorithm by dampening the remote speakers.  Anyways, a quick fix is to reduce the Soundbar volume independently from the H5, then boost up the overall volume.\\n\\nTo be totally honest, the H5 exceeded my very low expectations considering the horrible reviews everywhere.  While the sound is not exceptional, I'm certainly not complaining either.  If I were to do this again, I'd probably buy the H7 for the extra 30 watts of power... and actually I just might do it regardless.\\n\\nOn one other thing... once you have the speakers &#34; sync'd&#34; in the Music Flow app once, your friends who are on your Wifi network can simply download the Music Flow app, search for connected speakers, and automatically sync up to the already connected speakers.  They don't need to go through separate installations!  This means your guests can download the app, sync up, and they too can control music directly from their phone.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712ni3k2qiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712ni3k2qiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712ni3k2qiL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BFrqpxZnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BFrqpxZnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BFrqpxZnL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00XYVVYX4","B00XYVVYX4","AF54SUTQW64EZMAKVBRSR2VUDJWQ","2017-09-28 01:23:58.103","5","True","503"
"70525","5","Easy use, great sound/volume, comfortable","I tested these out with my parents, who have some hearing issues when we watch tv, and this has made a HUGE difference!\\n\\nFirst off, setup wasn't bad at all, and once the power and audio stuff is connected, it is SUPER easy to use. No crappy pairing process, as is usually the case with bluetooth. These are paired to the base already, so to turn them on, you basically just wear them. When you take them off, sound stops coming out. To charge them, you just put them back on the base. No re-pairing, loss of signal, etc.\\n\\nAlso, the range is great! We have a big house, but you can walk pretty much anywhere and keep the signal going. It's nice because if you have a show on and need to do something by the kitchen or in the garden, you can keep listening as if you were in the same room--no problem!\\n\\nThe sound quality is perfect for TV. I know some people aren't thrilled about it for music, and while that's totally valid, these are more for tv/movies anyway. For that, the clarity of sound is great, and you can go to pretty high volume. Also, you can adjust the volume differently for EACH EAR. So if you have hearing loss on one side but not the other, you don't have to harm your good ear and only hear quietly from the other--it has easy adjustments for this!\\n\\nComfort: Great news: these hook into your ears and hang down comfortably, and they do NOT have to go over your head. Why does this matter? Because you can wear them with glasses without interfering or squishing the glasses into the side of your head. The pressure is strong-ish (so they don't slip off) so if you are sensitive or prone to headaches from pressure, you might not want to wear them all the time, but for most people, it should be fine for a few hours at a time.\\n\\nDifference between the 2000 and the 5000 model? 50 feet range difference, and 3 hours less time on a full charge for the 2000. Sound quality seems the same, and functionality is pretty much the same.\\n\\nAwesome solution for those with so-so hearing, or people sharing space and not wanting to bother neighbors or other residents.","[]","B06XYS4YL3","B06XYS4YL3","AH5HSMUMRJRDWBPFDQ6G3EAAOSFQ","2017-05-11 23:59:30.000","3","False","503"

The instructions seemed simple enough but I was unable to build it, no matter how hard I tried. After studying the parts I realized that one of the bolts in the vertical pipe parts was a different size than the other side. There is a bolt embedded into the top section of the arms on either side. The horizontal bar has holes that the bolts go through and about half an inch is supposed to protrude out. A  wing nut is used on the protruding bolt to hold the bar in place. One of the bolts was so more deeply embedded into the pipe that there was no bolt protruding out of the arm and therefore it was impossible to secure the bar into place with a wing nut, making it liable to fall and injure someone if knocked. Upon closer inspection, I discovered that the pipe with the shorter bolt was also thinner than its counterpart making it slide down into the pipe it was supposed to be attached to.\\n\\nI fully admit that it took me a while to communicate with the seller and when I did, they said that the 30 day return period had expired but they would offer me a replacement stand if I paid the shipping. Again, work commitments (I work 3 jobs!) made me forget about the communication and when I did, I saw a message saying &#34;call us&#34; which I thought was weird as there was no number attached. Apparently, they had sent the number in a previous email message but I had assumed that they hadn't given me a number. When I did call them,  they have refused to honor their promise to give me a replacement stand that can actually stand as they claim it was a one-time offer and that one time is gone.\\n\\nSo now I have a broken stand that can't stand and am out of pocket $40.

I was very excited to receive it, but admittedly disappointed to discover that there is no DVD sleeve as stated in the description. I was hoping the seller could just send it to me, but I guess it was integrated into another version of this bag and they no longer have the one with the DVD sleeve. What a shame! Such a functional design! On the bright side the seller was VERY kind and really wanted me to be happy with my purchace offering 2 solutions and making me feel as though they really cared that I was pleased with my purchace. At the end of the day I'm very satisfied with the discount I was given for the missing component and used it to purchace a DVD sleeve to go with my case. I would say that you can definitely buy with confidence from this seller and you will be in good hands if there is ever a problem.\\n\\nThe case it's self is very nice as you can see in my pictures and video, it's attractive, and can hold all your plugs and even your remote in a zippered mesh compartment making everything stored in there easy to spot for quick retrieval. I also find the pocket with in the DVD player section of the case to be quite useful as well, you can put a couple 2 slot DVD holders in there and even your remote if you'd like to keep it handy. Over all this is a very well built and nice case. If there was one thing I'd change about this DVD player case (besides the dvd sleeve) it would be that there is only one zipper on each track which normally I think the extra zippers are a waste, but in this case where the fabric pieces that hold the lid of the case when open have a tendency to need to be tucked every time you close the zipper it would be nice to not have to zip past these. Over all this is a beautiful case with lovely blue interior which is very attractive and matches my DVD player. It's nice and padded and I feel my device is safely tucked inside. I can appreciate that the interior storage is such that I can keep all my components for viewing on my device in one place. I'd like to thank the seller again for offering great customer service and a very nice well built dependable product that should serve my family well for many years to come!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515954XJ-wL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515954XJ-wL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515954XJ-wL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61onzb2yk4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61onzb2yk4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61onzb2yk4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wuxpqYpsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wuxpqYpsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wuxpqYpsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wuxpqYpsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wuxpqYpsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wuxpqYpsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yLhqG4MtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yLhqG4MtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yLhqG4MtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B000ID37EA","B000ID37EA","AHQ2X42XLLQK3Q2KWFCVLRXYPGPQ","2017-09-07 01:29:48.683","6","True","503"
"397780","5","Booming Sound and LED Light Show Anywhere!","This is a great Bluetooth Party Speaker.  First, it’s big and loud and fulfills the mission for providing music for a party.  It has both LED light strips going around the thing as well as strobe lighting and a glow over the woofers. The LED strip will glow in several colors and can be managed through Sony’s Music Center app (but not on the speaker itself..you can only turn it on or off there). It has a pretty sturdy build and feels solid and weighty.\\n\\nIt has a built in rechargeable battery that lasts a good amount of time.  It definitely lasts a whole eight 1/2 work our day for us and has an AC plug for charging or providing power when it’s out of juice.  And yes, it charges while doing that which is much appreciated. On the unit itself you get a Power button, play/pause skip forward/back in one button, volume up and down , and unit controls such as input select (USB, RCA input, or Bluetooth connection) and buttons for turning the lights off/on, and the Mega Bass button which is popular for most people. On the rear you get a USB input that can house a USB drive with mp3 files loaded up which also can charge devices.  You do not get a 3.5mm input jack which surprised me, but you do get RCA jacks and can get an adapter for a 3.5mm if need one.  There is also RCA out for connecting more of these into a party chain. I especially like the two carry handles as they really let you get a good hold on them when carrying.  You can sit the speaker vertical or horizontal .\\n\\nSound is not too shabby.  It’s definitely loud and can fill a large room with sound.  Add the Mega Bass and you got yourselves a dance party if you want.  Don’t expect this to be a speaker that is full of clarity but it does quite good especially if you use that Sony Music Center app since you can use an equalizer with presets or your own.  You can also use the app to DJ the music and lights.  It’s really quite cool.\\n\\nAll in all, this is great for parties at the beach, park, or a big dance room. It’s a great speaker system.","[]","B074XLS5X5","B074XLS5X5","AGL6OK7XA4BD4GRMNAQRNLYR3P3Q","2017-12-07 05:15:24.203","0","False","503"
"811180","1","Warranty is determine based on the serial # of your device, regardless of how long its sets in inventory.","My initial experience was great with the SB6183, but within a year that began to change.  I bought mine approximately a year ago and registered it via the online Arris website.  The SB6183 began to exhibit the popular rebooting issues and then finally went dead just a few days ago.  Had Comcast come out to replace with a temporary modem, which they were glad to do and even stated that if I get a replacement modem and return theirs within 30 days, they would not charge a retail fee.  No complaints there.  I then contacted Arris for warranty support the next day.  Arris informed me that my SB6183 is out of warranty based on the serial number, which was unexpected, as I bought it from Best Buy a year ago.  Guess these device sit in inventory for a while and it appears that Arris does not take that into consideration.  Needless to say, I was not very happy with the response, but was told that I would need to supply the original receipt, which should not be a problem.\\nMaybe due to the experience that I've had with other reputable companies, I have a concern with the steps requires me to take to obtain warranty support and get a replacement modem.  These steps could possible be completed within a few weeks, but I work from home and some of the steps seem totally unnecessary, since I've already perform them with the initial call to Arris.  The Arris support representative outline the steps below, which are in addition to my initial call.  Steps 2, 3 and 4, seem to be totally unnecessary.\\n1) Submit receipt, wait for acknowledgement from Arris,\\n2) wait for confirmation email with phone number to call back Arris,\\n3) trouble shoot the dead modem again with Arris,\\n4) if determine, device issue can not be resolved over the phone, Arris will provide RMA #,\\n5) Customer ship modem back with RMA #,\\n6) Arris will determine if modem needs to be replaced;\\n7) Customer waits until Arris ships replacement unit.\\n\\nI understand that product failures will occur, but with a device like a cable modem, companies should establish more efficient process to provide warranty support to their customers.  For the above warranty support reasons, I will look to companies other than Arris for future product purchases.","[]","B00MA5U1FW","B0BHGRJDCK","AFEZ3OXBP5PT6NCOK7DI5HCWWRBA","2017-07-25 20:11:37.900","1","False","503"
"532803","4","Fantastic wireless earbuds. Would recommend to anyone","Ok so I I've only had these for a day. May post another review a couple of months from now.They are awesome but I'll start with the cons\\n\\nCon\\n- Can be a little annoying to setup ear pieces to go above the ear. A lot of tweaking of the wings were involved and I was really aware that you were supposed to insert them then turn them up. The fit clips although clever and frankly innovative for wireless earbuds also require quite a bit of tweaking to get right.\\n\\n- because they're in ear headphones they can cause a lot of irritation if you don't have it perfectly which I didn't for the better part of the day\\n\\n- biggest pet peeve and everyone else is probably saying this PROPRIETARY CHARGING PORT. It kinda sucks because I know I'm probably gonna lose it and pay 15, 30, 45 dollars for a new ones T_T\\n\\nPros\\n- once you do adjust everything to their perfect setting for you they are super comfortable. Minimal irritation and even then I may still need to adjust them a little more personally.\\n\\n- again over ear and xfit are amazing for wireless earbuds. They don't get in the way and I don't think they're even noticeable to other people unless they were looking at you from the side to top it off if people were looking at you from the side people would only see the really cool logo on the buds so points for style.\\n\\n- most importantly the audio quality is great. It's start off flat which people wanting to use these out of the box will be put off by butwhen you use any of the presets which there are a ton it really lets you cater to any individual song or genre which makes them incredible versatile.\\n\\n- to sling off that the companion app is great and strait forward. No account creation necessary as it allows you to sync with google or Spotify accounts.\\n\\n- instructions tab learn control and setup features is very useful and informative.\\n\\n-Battery life has been long supposedly 8 hours and I'm not doubting it so far.\\n\\nOverall really worth it I just hope the next gen has a micro USB built in or something.

"506113","5","Advanced RF Analyzer Tool & Radio Receiver Device at Ridiculous Price.  Engineer's Dream.","These work great for RTL-SDR use.  Plus they give you a pack of 3 Various antennas.  NooElec also sends you an Email link on how to setup this SDR up in Windows.  For the price, these are just incredible to mess around with for looking at the RF spectrum or to check signal levels For Your New Scanner Antenna!  You should also buy a (SMA male to F female adapter ) to hook up to some RG6 cable for an outdoor antenna setup for less interference (noise floor) from your computer, etc. Very revealing, to see just how good/bad a signal comes in to you and how high the noise floor level floats underneath.  You could spend thousands and get a high end device to do that too, but this SDR (with the free software) will give you nearly that accuracy for $25.  I have at least one running all the time and after an hour or so, there is No Drift whatsoever! I'm locked on a P-25 control channel and the carrier peaks exactly on frequency and just stays there all day.  It has no drift.  You can't ask for better specs.  It receives radio signals from about the CB band (27Mhz) to about 1.7Ghz.  Great for radio type &#34;pirate experiments&#34; too.  You can hear and examine any signal you point it at, but it will only decode audio on Analog signals with the standard software.  Digital P-25, etc signals will just be heard as noise bursts.  For these digital signals P-25/trunking you'll need two of these SDR units and other software and yet more advanced computer skills. You can also use it to look at FM radio broadcast signals, and RDS data too. You can hear those as well. I  also have the NESDR mini 2, but this is the better package deal.  The case gets warm but it does not block another USB port, so this thing was well thought out.  It is not a toy.  NooElec gets my 5 stars vote for an Incredible Radio Receiver Device that really delivers the goods as a full fledged advanced RF Analyzer Tool with a low price.  They don't know how Great it really is.  I have wanted this particular device in my possession for 40 years.

"801683","2","The horrible microphone is a bigger Achilles Heel than I thought possible","Boy, do I really want to like these headphones.  First off, I've been a lifetime Bose customer -- I have loved pretty much everything they put out.  In fact, my noise canceling earbuds (the $300 ones) are hands down the best headphones I've ever owned.  They're unbelievable.  I've owned two of them.\\n\\nAnd so it was through this lens that I was hoping the same standard of quality would be present with these Soundsports.  Here's the TL;DR version: the sound quality is just as fantastic as corded headphones but the microphone is amazingly fantastically tremendously terrible.  I am also awaiting a new pair of headphones (which Bose replaced for free) in the hopes that my pair was just a fluke.\\n\\nI really hate sounding so sensationalist, and since getting these headphones in December (it's now Feb), I've used them every day to give them the &#34;ol' college try&#34;.\\n\\nUnfortunately, there are two major issues with the microphone sensitivity:\\n1) The microphone itself is so sensitive that it literally picks up everything.  Doors opening, conversations being had across the room, me typing, even me walking.  It's so bad that folks on the other line regularly comment they can't actually hear me from the &#34;din&#34; of everything else going on.  What's peculiar is that my other headphones, the noise canceling ear buds, have the best microphone on the planet.\\n\\n2) The headphone cord itself is its own attenuator -- meaning that if I turn my head and the cord brushes against my collar, that feedback makes its way into the phone.  Talk about distracting for other people.\\n\\nWhile I use these headphones every day to work out, I am using them far more frequently to take/place calls.  I didn't fully appreciate just how detrimental a bad microphone could be to the overall design.\\n\\nI will be reporting back here soon, once Bose sends me a new pair of headphones.  Like always, their customer service has been top notch and have offered to ship me a brand new pair for free in the hopes that I had a hardware fluke.  I will gladly raise the rating on this review if the new pair fixes the issue.","[]","B01L7PSJFO","B0B62FJF1J","AHY2CGQEHZ7ZLOCYQWQN5FR4EENQ","2017-02-06 16:51:40.000","1","False","503"
"128186","4","Once I got past setup, I loved this thing.","This is one hard review to write.\\n\\nOk, let me level with you. It's pricey and it's not for novices. You'd think it's easy enough, I'm not an IT hardware guy but I've set up quite a few high end ones. Splurged this time.  It's a pain to set up. Period. Support is solid and the company will help you but if you think you're just going to buy an 'expensive' one and it'll be easy, it wasn't for me.\\n\\nPast setup, It's a dream. it took me a day and a half, likely the idiot doing the setup not the product but it did take a while and a few calls. Once that was finished it was all down hill. Works perfect, flawless, every time. I have 4 monitors, two of which are TV's with HDMI connections and just a complex setup. It's  a dream.\\n\\nNow that I know what I was doing wrong it's a walk in the park. Easy as pie.\\n\\nYes, buy this. Yes it's worth every penny. If you're the least bit hardware savvy you'll be up and running. I know b/c I bought another high end one, learned from my mistakes and was able to get it going fast.\\n\\nCaveat:  I've only owned it three weeks but the load I put on it is hefty and I am in love with this thing. I was so mad (b/c I'm a baby) I was going to throw it at the wall during setup. I called support, yes they were foreign (gasp) but they were patient, competent and handled it immediately. Immediately.  When I say immediately I'm talking like 3 minutes. That's why I say it's on me 100%.\\n\\nLove this thing. Only gripe after setup was that there weren't enough ports. Easily fixed , buy bigger one. See next review.\\n\\nLove it and even though I say it's pricey and talk about how much I love it, it's not that pricey and worth every penny.  If you're already a KVM whiz it's a walk in the park. If it's your first one, read the manual, ask a friend or just call support if you run into any problem","[]","B00310EES0","B07RSGPN7F","AFMGK3QWHUTAJQGRFATTWIWK35LA","2017-01-11 06:57:43.000","0","False","503"
"259862","2","The Good: Sound quality is pretty great when listening to ...","**Update** I originally gave these 3 stars because I really liked the audio quality. However, I went out today and bought new headphones. Comparing those headphones, which cost the same retail price, are night and day. These sound muddy, have very poor bass, and lower volume than the new headphones which I won't name.\\n\\nI've had these for several months and wear them almost everyday, if I remember them.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n\\nSound quality is pretty great when listening to music. I tested these against some Bose headphones, and I liked these better. The buds do a great job of drowning out external noise.\\n\\nBattery life is pretty great. I have never had it go out during a normal shift at work. I do tend to listen to them off and on so they are not constantly playing, and I do recharge them at night.\\n\\nThe headphones are pretty comfortable wearing all day. They stay around the neck when at the gym as well.\\n\\nThe buttons all work as they should, and it's nice having access to Siri, volume, track skip, and play/pause from the headphones.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n\\nCall quality is terrible. I can hear people just fine, but no one can hear me. I get a lot of people saying it sounds like I'm underwater. And this is after I verify nothing is covering the mic.\\n\\nBluetooth: I don't have a lot of problems connecting to my devices unless trying to connect to multiple devices at once. This is much more of a Bluetooth issue I feel, but can be annoying having to resync multiple times. The range (coupled with the poor call quality) is what will ultimately force me to buy a different pair of headphones. At work, my desk sits about 10-15 feet away from the copier, and when I go to pick up copies, the audio starts to cut in and out. If I go an extra 10-15 feet to the breakroom, I lose connectivity altogether. The skullcandy headphones I lost had a much better range than these.\\n\\nOverall, the audio quality cannot make up for very poor call quality and abysmal connection issues. Luckily I broke these accidentally the other day and now I need a new pair of headphones.","[]","B01CTQ5TKI","B01CTQ5TKI","AENGNN7QWSXX2QOGU6YEZI5FF2OQ","2017-03-14 03:56:47.000","2","True","503"
"965021","5","Excellent Lightweight Quality and Design, Sounds Great For Voice, Just OK for Music","These Sony C400s are my second pair of behind-the-neck wearable wireless earbuds. They are noticeably (or not noticeably) light and don't make me feel like i'm wearing a yoke after several hours, which is a big plus--i actually forget i have these on w the earbuds hanging down, and they don't fall off. Unlike my other behind the neck earbuds (LG Tone), these Sonys don't have speakers or hidden & retractable cords either, so it's a trade-off between lightness and additional features...but, of course, these Sonys are about a third of the price of the LGs- a huge plus in itself.\\n\\nI've been wearing these about 2 weeks to listen to language learning course content, and I couldn't be happier. The sound is very clear for the spoken word, and all the inflections and details are easy to hear and understand. The earplugs are comfortable and although not technically noise cancelling, do a good job of blocking most outside sounds just due to the good fit. I prefer the retractable cords on my LG, but these hanging cords are too short to get tangled or in your way mostly. I find myself pulling the cords out from my jacket or collar, but no biggie.\\n\\nThe sound quality for music is just so-so. These are pricey imo for the uninspiring audio, which is missing both depth and delicious clarity from pretty much all ranges. However, they are reasonable for the casual music listener.\\n\\nWhere these excel, however, is in they way I use them- for podcasts, audiobooks, regular TV shows and language programs, where musical sounds aren't as important. The battery life seems like forever--i have worn these for about 8-10 hrs straight w no prob, and didn't bother to try to run them out but recharged at that point. Also, the feather weight, as discussed, turned out to be more critical to me than i realized or noticed before switching from heavier earphones of all types. I find myself favoring these earbuds over all my others, and reach for them about 95% of the time (other 5% i'm listening to music using superior over the ear phones). I'm giving these a 5-star rating, since I can't really complain too much about a product i've been using the most.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717APM5QTwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717APM5QTwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717APM5QTwL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ts2qbmy4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ts2qbmy4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ts2qbmy4L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vu9rh5INL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vu9rh5INL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vu9rh5INL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B074WFT3KL","B074WFT3KL","AFATNFWGYVVMEZWGDNLDUXRBRFLQ","2017-10-05 20:10:21.878","1","False","503"
"398855","5","Balance throughout the ranges is amazing. Nothing about this headphone is boring","WOW.\\nThese headphones are superb.\\nBalance throughout the ranges is amazing. Nothing about this headphone is boring.\\nIt's like an hd650 with better lower and upper extension, and clarity with less bleed into the mids while maintaining a better, controlled bass. Soundstage is slightly smaller compared to that can, but it's nothing to speak of.\\nI have owned a lot of headphones but this one may be the best. I certainly like it more than HD800 or any MrSpeakers headphone. The balance is just so good. These excel at and with any genre.\\nMale vocals are holy on these, there is slight warmth on the lower midrange.\\nHowever the warmth doesn't encroach into bloat, the vocals are amazingly believable and organic.\\n Upper mids though have an ever so slight recession so while female vocals are still very good they are not the best possible.\\nIt's important to know that while these easily extend down to an audible 20hz the midbass does have much more presence.\\nIt's also important to know that this headphone does it very competently. That midbass isn't loose, nor does it bleed into the midrange at all such as the case of the hd650s lower mids sounding ever so slightly bleedy.\\n\\nI really like Beyer cans but these are on the next level from any manufacturer. Honestly these or the 1990s are the best headphones, depending on your preference (they are very similar, can't go wrong).\\n\\nThese headphones are also super cozy despite being no slouch at 340 grams. You can wear them all day, they are breathable and have no hot spots due to that micro-velour. The design is &#34;classic&#34; I would say and it's growing on me even though I don't like the look as much as the t1/t90/1990. They certainly feel higher quality than Beyer's lower line, despite looking similar in pictures. The headband adjustment too is very clean, and dual entry makes it easy to go balanced, another reason I decided on these over the 1990s (they are 3 pin so you need a bunch of modding to get them to 4pin or dual-entry....).\\n\\nWorth it all the way.

"240518","1","No connectivity","We received the drawing tablet yesterday and attempted setup on Windows 7. First error occurred upon connecting the tablet USB to the computer. At least three drivers failed to install. After several reboot and second attempt, two more installed but one did not even after second reboot. Weird that this driver appeared to be a Bluetooth driver (hardware id starting with BTHENUM).\\n\\nWe proceeded to install the driver and app off of the CD. We first uninstalled the old Wacom driver. The Huion driver and app appeared to install correctly, but upon starting the app all the controls were grayed-out and the status said &#34;device disconnected.&#34; At this point the tablet was on and displaying a standard windows desktop. The pen was moving the mouse. In MediBang, there was no pressure sensitivity, and of course no functionality on the buttons.\\n\\nPerhaps the worst part of all this is that we called the Huion &#34;Hotline&#34; number from the Thank You card that came with the tablet. No answer, no message, the number just rang and rang. Terrible. Also PM'd Huion on FB, but so far no response there either.\\n\\nThe tablet does appear to be well made, with a beautiful display with a nice feel using the pen. This is the only reason this product does not get a 1-star review.\\n\\nUPDATE: I'm changing this review to one star. The so-called Huion &#34;hotline&#34; never answered, but I finally did hear from Huion support in the form of a Facebook PM at 11PM. The exchange was mostly about them asking for, and me providing, information about the sale of the product and serial number. I provided the information and didn't hear back for three days, at which point I Huion claimed to have never received by email. They gave me a different email to send the information and again I sent it and didn't hear back from them. It became amply clear to me that I was wasting my time. As for the serious installation/connectivity issues, they provided virtually no help. I did try installing on a different computer -- still no connectivity. The installation errors seem to be related to USB drivers that the tablet either requires and attempts to install. Different USB drivers failed on the two machines during installation.","[]","B0779QTQ13","B0779QTQ13","AHCZPRRYAQT64JBS6IGNS6IZXPSQ","2017-12-13 17:23:44.271","4","True","503"
"850227","5","Excellent Starter-to-Intermediate CB Radio","I bought the Pro505XL in December 2016. It's a nice, compact unit with some decent features. It does NOT have a built-in SWR meter. Saw a couple of reviews where people said that, but it isn't true. It has a signal-strength meter, those bars on the left side of the display, but that's not a SWR meter.\\n\\nSome advice on this radio. First, get a real good antenna for it. I mean a LONG one, high quality. Second, get an external speaker for it and hook that up, rather than using the built-in speaker. Sound will be much better. And yeah...the good old bullhorn speaker under the hood of your vehicle up near the front grille of your vehicle is always fun. I like the silent controls on this one, too. No click-click-click stuff when changing channels. Since the radio is rated at the legal 4 watt limit, your antenna is EVERYTHING. Go for big, go bold, or don't go at all. If you decide later to upgrade to a CB with more functions or something, you won't be sorry. Besides, who wants a cheap antenna that doesn't get out very far, anyway?\\n\\nI mounted this one on the top of the dash in my (restored) 1987 Nissan Hardbody truck. I attached the mounting bracket and then used velcro strips on the bracket, and on the dashboard. Makes it easy to disconnect and store if you want to. Stick it IN the truck, rip it out if you wish. Doing this also keeps the bottom-mounted speaker UP off the dash, so you can hear it. But like I said, an external speaker really is better.\\n\\nAnd no matter what you do...make sure you take the time and patience to get that antenna matched properly. You want an average of 1.2 or less on your SWR meter on all channels. (That will give you 95% of your potential output. 1.0 is the ideal, and gives you 100%) There are many good videos on YouTube on how to match a CB antenna. A single millimeter difference in the proper length can be the difference between getting out long range, or only a couple of miles. And if your SWR reading goes much above 2.0, not only will your signal not reach far, but you can easily fry your radio.","[]","B005ZLB0E4","B09YL2D2RQ","AGEH7HVRYCQCFKAIAN3BFX42MLFA","2017-04-09 04:49:54.000","7","True","503"
"799034","4","Good Replacement Band for the Fitbit Alta!","I've had my [[ASIN:B01B25PKB0 Fitbit Alta Fitness Tracker, Silver/Black, Small (US Version)]] for a year and a half and it's still working great! I've had to replace the band a few times now because they eventually get worn out since I wear it all the time, day and night. When my last band wouldn't stay hooked to my Fitbit, I needed to order a band right away since I didn't want to risk losing the tracker itself. This is the first time I've tried bands not made by Fitbit but I thought I would take a chance because of the color selection and price.\\n\\nThese bands are made to fit the Fitbit Alta so make sure you double-check which Fitbit you have before ordering. Just like the Fitbit replacement bands, these come in sizes small and large in a variety of colors as well as two different clasp styles. I like that there are both the standard clasp like the one that comes with the Fitbit and then a band that fastens more like a watch. Some people have had trouble with the former style of clasp so having this alternate clasp is a nice option.\\n\\nPersonally, I've never had trouble with the traditional clasp so I ordered that one in a small navy blue color. I measured the band and it's the exact same size as the Fitbit brand and also includes the size printed on the inside of the band. My wrist measures six inches in circumference and a small fits me perfectly. The band looks identical to the Fitbit brand but I can tell it's made much cheaper. When I opened the packaging, it had that cheap plastic smell but that went away within a couple days. The navy blue color is pretty and my tracker snapped right into the band. I was able to snap the band right onto my wrist without any problems. The packaging doesn't state the country of origin.\\n\\nI've had it for a month and a half and haven't had any trouble with it. I can tell the material feels different but it's also about half the price of the Fitbit bands. If I have any trouble with the band or I lose it entirely (I hope not!), I will update this review and adjust my star rating accordingly. Until then, I'm giving this product four stars because I like the product, the color options, clasp style options, and the price.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+O1FH-44L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+O1FH-44L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+O1FH-44L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714RcC7OmzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714RcC7OmzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714RcC7OmzL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NDJrbE9UL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NDJrbE9UL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NDJrbE9UL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71w+rbWvMyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71w+rbWvMyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71w+rbWvMyL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FlcW2ybEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FlcW2ybEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FlcW2ybEL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NaAJvQbFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NaAJvQbFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NaAJvQbFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TuM2T73zL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TuM2T73zL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TuM2T73zL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01FXGVXN8","B01FXGVXN8","AH4YBVO724V3BJUUFP4DBFQGNEHQ","2017-10-30 15:02:30.605","0","True","503"
"545663","4","Great Sound Extraction, but this Device may encounter Switching Issues when used with with Older DlP TVs with Adapted DVI Inputs","If you are buying this device to extract sound from an HDMI source before sending the HDMI video signal along to a TV that has only a DVI input, please note that [at least with my older DlP TV on which I, long ago, installed an HDMI to DVI adapter on the TV's only digital vibeo input (DVI) port because the TV has no HDMI ports] through apparently no fault of this device itself, when an HDMI source is selected via this device, the DLP TV must afterwards be cycled on and off again to restore the TV picture, as, upon switching sources, the TV will show either a distorted picture or no picture at all until either the source or the TV or both are cycled off and back on again. This is likely just an eccentricity of my (now very old) model of Samsung DLP TV. However, if your TV setup happens to be similar or the same as mine, the switching capability of this device will be pretty much useless to you and you may just want to purchase a somewhat less expensive sound extractor without the switching capability and switch the sources by hand by manually plugging and unplugging them to your single port sound extractor.\\n\\nHaving said all of the above, the build, sound extraction capability and switching capability of this device all seem to be very good. My concern for potential purchasers is that, since you are probably buying this device for older TV monitors, that do not have full HDMI capabilities relative to sound extraction, you are more likely to encounter the issue with your particular TV not properly handling this device's output as the inputs to this device are switched, in which case, the cost of the extra cables to hook this device up to your older TV and the extra cost of a switching sound extraction device are added costs that get you very little if anything in return.\\n\\nMy less-than-perfect rating reflects my experience son far in attempting to switch between various devices, if I happen stumble across an easy solution to my problem with switching sources to my DLP TV using this device, I will try to update this post. In the meantime, I will be using this device as a pass-through box only to extract the sound output from various HDMI sources that do not have separate sound outputs and I will be manually connecting the HDMI outputs from various devices to a single input to this switch only if the source device does not have a separate sound output.","[]","B01HM1RP6G","B01HM1RP6G","AEB7D7YG7ED7WYCLQPEXDXH5NPRA","2017-02-14 05:18:09.000","2","True","503"
"786975","5","Great laptop computer for a good price","Been using the laptop for a week now. Got everything installed and up to date. Not so much bloatware as some reviews say, or I dunno, other laptops I've had in the past have been worse. This laptop is great. It is big, it's definitely not for everyone, but for a huge laptop it is very thin and lightweight . Oh and it DOES (at least mine does) have THUNDERBOLT support, it's actually compatible with the upcoming ASUS external GPU.\\n\\nIt does get hot when playing, but that's expected. The keyboard does not get uncomfortable, the part that gets really hot is between the keyboard and screen. The screen is gorgeous. The 2 drives work well, SSD is fast and booting up takes only a couple of seconds. The keyboard is excellent, the touchpad is good, but not great. It's a little too sensitive for my taste, but I always use an external mouse anyways so its a non factor for me.\\n\\nI thought I would have an issue with the keyboard backlighting/colors/font, but turns out you don't really even see the keyboard much when you write, and the backlighting in red is great in low light cause it doesn't distract you from the screen but you can still see the keys. I'm not sure it would work all the time in a professional environment, but I work remote so I don't care. This thing definitely turns eyes. I'm a frontend dev and most of the time have Photoshop, an IDE and a bunch of other windows and browsers open. This thing doesn't even hiccup with all that open.\\n\\nIf I had to say something bad about this computer I guess is that it's a shame there's no dedicated media keys (I learned by experimenting the Fn + Arrow keys work as prev, stop/play and next, which works but isn't ideal) and that for some reason, I can't change the Fn keys to be the default keys and have the F Keys work when I press the Fn key. There's a ton of posts on the ASUS board of people requesting this, you should be able to change that, at least in the BIOS, but you can't. Other than that, awesome computer that packs a lot of stuff for a very moderate price. Other brands seem to be closer to the $2k range for the same set of components.","[]","B01KB0X0OQ","B01LY4X2OX","AHYK5MYDAERWMKUN4FFV5WT66VOA","2017-01-02 19:28:23.000","0","True","503"
"460166","4","The case is a good value for under $100 but does have some compromises","The case is a good value for under $100 but does have some compromises.\\n\\nThe pros first:\\n1. It's beautiful. Clean front panel and sharp angles everywhere. Tempered glass is beautiful to look at and it feels solidly built as far as the case itself goes.\\n\\n2. Cable management is good with the cable hiding strip, and plenty of holes including holes in the PSU shroud.\\n\\n3. Compact size while still allowing for a good amount of building room inside the case.\\n\\n4. Relatively cheap price for a case of this quality, and comparable to offerings from CM, Phanteks, and In Win.\\n\\n5. The puck is useful. I don't VR but it's good for sticking your headphones/headset to the front of the case instead of throwing them on-top like I do or having to buy a stand and take up desk space.\\n\\nNow for some cons:\\n\\n1. IO panel quality is questionable. My power button works fine for now, but is extremely rattle when touched. I have seen this reported as &quot;normal&quot; but it doesn't instill confidence and I feel like it could stop working at any time because it feels so flimsy.\\n\\n2. Airflow isn't the best. Not only does it not have the best airflow, but it comes with 2 output fans and nothing for intake in the front. I suggest getting 2 140mm fans like some noctua PWM's for good intake to achieve positive pressure and keep dust from settling without adding too much noise.\\n\\n3. Speaking of noise, it's okay with aftermarket fans, but the included 120mm's are not quiet by any means, also ugraded these to some 120mm noctuas and with a good air CPU cooler you can get the noise to a good level.\\n\\n4. No dampening or shock absorption for HDD cage. My HDD's are used for backup purposes only, but if your primary drive is an HDD I suggest a different case, or installing some sort of rubber washer or you will get humming/buzzing from the cage.\\n\\nOverall case, but you should know what you need to compromise for the beautiful looks and compact size.","[]","B01LZQMXJT","B07J45XS7K","AEAENJ7FERGP4BSEIGYGGVON34RA","2017-11-30 21:30:55.187","2","True","503"
"70524","5","Easy use, great sound/volume, comfortable","I tested these out with my parents, who have some hearing issues when we watch tv, and this has made a HUGE difference!\\n\\nFirst off, setup wasn't bad at all, and once the power and audio stuff is connected, it is SUPER easy to use. No crappy pairing process, as is usually the case with bluetooth. These are paired to the base already, so to turn them on, you basically just wear them. When you take them off, sound stops coming out. To charge them, you just put them back on the base. No re-pairing, loss of signal, etc.\\n\\nAlso, the range is great! We have a big house, but you can walk pretty much anywhere and keep the signal going. It's nice because if you have a show on and need to do something by the kitchen or in the garden, you can keep listening as if you were in the same room--no problem!\\n\\nThe sound quality is perfect for TV. I know some people aren't thrilled about it for music, and while that's totally valid, these are more for tv/movies anyway. For that, the clarity of sound is great, and you can go to pretty high volume. Also, you can adjust the volume differently for EACH EAR. So if you have hearing loss on one side but not the other, you don't have to harm your good ear and only hear quietly from the other--it has easy adjustments for this!\\n\\nComfort: Great news: these hook into your ears and hang down comfortably, and they do NOT have to go over your head. Why does this matter? Because you can wear them with glasses without interfering or squishing the glasses into the side of your head. The pressure is strong-ish (so they don't slip off) so if you are sensitive or prone to headaches from pressure, you might not want to wear them all the time, but for most people, it should be fine for a few hours at a time.\\n\\nDifference between the 2000 and the 5000 model? 50 feet range difference, and 3 hours less time on a full charge for the 2000. Sound quality seems the same, and functionality is pretty much the same.\\n\\nAwesome solution for those with so-so hearing, or people sharing space and not wanting to bother neighbors or other residents.","[]","B06XYTQJTN","B06XYTQJTN","AH5HSMUMRJRDWBPFDQ6G3EAAOSFQ","2017-05-11 23:59:33.000","16","False","503"
"380128","4","Great Cameras, Minor Flaws and Ring Doorbell Comparison","I really like this camera, with a few exceptions. I bought 3 of them together and point them out the windows for security. I also have a Ring doorbell but the motion detection was very spotty so I wanted to start handling front door motion detection with this and only use the Ring for actual doorbell rings as a backup. But I am going to do some comparisons to the Ring.\\n\\nPros:\\nMotion detection and video quality so far has been top notch, well above the Ring.\\nExtremely easy set up, no problems.\\nWifi is pretty good. I normally get spotty wifi out in my detached garage and this handled it like a champ.\\nGreat integration with echo show.\\n\\nCons:\\nI really don't want to record audio and there is no way to turn audio off.\\nYou apparently have to use the phone app or echo show, there is no website to view/share video from like the Ring. This is y biggest gripe.\\nSharing videos is more difficult than the ring because there is no website, you have to download it to a google drive share and then share it from there or email/text the whole video.\\nI feel like it could have had an echo dot chip put into it for a few bucks more. I have some of these where I am planning to put dots in the future, would be nice not to have to have two devices.\\n\\nSo for a 5 star I would have liked at least 2 to 3 more features: Ability to shut off audio recording, somewhere in the amazon website to review and share video, echo dot integration.\\n\\nI have one more small con but this one isn't fair to ding Amazon for. I need to swap my Ring doorbell's &#34;Front Door&#34; name with my cloud cam &#34;Front Door&#34; and it just wont let me do it.

"748660","2","Really great screen, but mine is ghosting after 15 months of use...And now it's dead...","I loved this monitor when i first got it on my desk. Really enjoyed using it, and I'm a professional 3d artist, so I scrutinize my displays. This particular one is for my home setup and is pretty great. BUT after just over 14 months or so, I started noticing ghosting! I have a black desktop. When there is a white window against that black, everything is fine. As soon as I place another window that is grey over the white window, there is a noticeable ghost of the white that appears in the grey! It disappears after a minute or so, but I would not want to ever see that on my desk at a studio. Otherwise I really love this screen, but the ghosting is a real annoying trait, and I'm not sure if it's just this one or a more endemic issue with the panels. If I were on a project at a studio, I would ask it to be replaced asap. Seeing as this is my home screen, even though I do some work from home, I have to grit and bear it for a while, until I decide on a replacement. Now of course, this is not a super expensive professional display, but still. That's disappointing.\\n\\nUPDATE: And now it has started flicker on and off and is pretty much dead. Tried it on other machines and with other cables, it's the panel, it's dying and unusable at this point. Super disappointing HP. Took it down to 2 stars. A high-end monitor like this should've lasted a lot longer.\\n\\nAs far as an earlier review that said this is useless for 3d work, I disagree that it's the fault of the monitor, this screen (aside from my ghosting) has been great in my work, the 4k issue has to do with software apps not catching up to the 4k resolutions yet, which they need to do asap (you know who you are). I wouldn't do work at 4k on anything smaller than 27&#34; and that, especially in 3ds Max, is a bit of a strain. Again, that's not the fault of the screen. I think that user was saying don't get 4k yet if you're into 3d work, which I kinda agree with, until the software catches up. And windows scaling for 3d work is useless, too. Has to be native for best effect.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71p2znn1-gL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71p2znn1-gL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71p2znn1-gL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00SCDUA5C","B00SCDUA5C","AHTRYCYA7YSNGP2JXS2QQRRR6KHQ","2017-05-19 23:05:03.000","1","True","503"
"724328","5","Works great","Strap\\n\\nI bought two sets of these to strap down two led tvs.\\n\\nMy first impressions were that the straps seem strong enough.  The buckles were design to tighten its grip if tension was applied. You must follow the directions for this to work correctly. I could see if the buckles were not position correctly, then it could be loosen by gravity or simply kids getting a hold of the loose excess straps.  Each strap came with a set of screws and bolts.\\n\\nFor each strap, there are two different ends (see picture).  The end near the buckle has three holes, two at approximately 13/64 inch (I used a drill bit to measure) and the other a little larger at 9/32 inch.  This is the end that was mounted to the tv.  The other end has three holes at 13/64 inch.  The 9/32 is the largest hole and the one that can fit most of the bolts for the VESA mounting holes.\\n\\nI have two different TVs, both with different tv stands.  One tv stand had a wood back with metal shelves attached via bolts.  The wood back seem to be mdf wood, which I didn't feel comfortable screwing into.  I think it would eventually get lose.  The bolt was the best choice, but the strap end wasn't big enough for the bolt.  I ended up making the hole larger (make sure you clamp it down or else it will spin out of control when you use  a drill).  One thing I noticed when I drilled the end, the other layer did not flake.  This is good and it means the metal is not coated with a paint that will eventually flake.\\n\\nThe other tv was easier.  The back of the tv stand was all metal will holes as part of the style.  I just used my own bolt with a nut and washer.\\n\\nA few suggestion: I would put lock washers to make sure the bolts don't come lose.  If you end up trimming the strap, use a lighter to melt the end a little so it doesn't fray and come undone.  You can probably see YouTube videos for instructions.\\n\\nI like the fact that this is adjustable.

"981462","4","Hang on to your precious phone/camera","Shooting with a bare iPhone is a very risky business. Holding it out of car windows, over bridge railings, one-handing it to get a better angle - all it takes is a minor bump from some toddler careening by and there goes your camera. Just holding your phone and chatting, any little distraction or surprise can make you loosen your grip. As a professional photographer, I know the hazards. DSLRs provide a robust hand grip, but for complete security, you also need a hand strap so that you can completely relax your hand, letting go of the camera and it won't take off on its own.\\n\\nThis is the only product that I have found on the market that does that job - and does it very well. Shooting in still camera mode, there is no way the camera is going to come loose from my hand, no matter what else happens. Yes, they would have to pry it out of my cold dead fingers...\\n\\nOne reviewer complained that the swivel was not tight when shooting in video mode. You do have to tighten it properly, but it is plenty  tight for shooting. I have large hands and have no trouble getting three fingers comfortably through the grip. In fact, just curving my fingers a little wedges them against the grip, providing a very solid support, making the camera part of my hand. I didn't find the plastic of the grip to be a problem like some reviewers have.\\n\\nGetting the camera mounted requires a bit of focus, but once installed, is ultra-secure.\\n\\nThe only design change I would like to see is moving the pushbutton mount out over the grip pivot and canted forward so it was right under my index finger, as is standard on many DSLRs. However, holding the button in your other hand is a fun way to shoot people because they can't really tell when you are taking a shot.\\n\\nFinally, the price is high by about double considering the bill of materials. OTOH, this is the only one of its kind on the market and it does the job it was designed for, so I guess it's worth it. Heck, I've paid $80 for a stupid DSLR lens cap, so it's all relative. Happy camper, knowing I am not going to watch my $1000 iPhone making an unintentional jump off the Golden Gate bridge.","[]","B01L9WTIJ6","B01L9WTIJ6","AGBXLKHS2GYOFRNDW3HEQ5HBL6MQ","2017-01-26 23:08:44.000","8","True","502"
"196268","5","Great Little Dash Cam despite issues","When I started my search for a dash cam I was looking for something simple & reliable. I tried at least 4 different cams sold here on amazon. This little dash cam seemed to provide what I was looking for & more.\\nAfter a few weeks of use I noticed it was not recording over the previous videos as it's supposed to, despite the claim to be able to do so. But what was worse, was it continued to act like it was recording like normal (make sure to check your cam is actually doing the loop recording.) I emailed the seller & they were quick to reply. They advised me to do several things as you've probably seen in other reviews. Update the software & use their recommended sd card. (Mentioned in the seller's product info) I have done what was suggested & am still in the process of seeing if the suggestions work. I will update this post when I have more info. But what I was most satisfied with, besides having a duel camera in one unit, was their quick to reply customer service. Prior to the unit not loop recording, I had weird freak problems like a bunch of 0s appear out of nowhere on the little cam's screen like shown in 1 of the pictures with this post. I don't think this cam likes cold weather (around 20°F). Once the vehicle was warmed up & the cam restarted the strange numbers went away.\\nOverall, I still like my purchase over the many others. I will stick with Vantrue in hopes that the little cam will be flawless in the end.\\n\\nUpdate 2.15.2017\\nSwitching to the proper recommended SD card improved on the situations mentioned above. However, from time to time I still have the camera starting & restarting in a loop if it's been really cold and I started my car via my car starter. Once again, I don't think this is fault of the camera, it's just too cold for it so it retaliates.

"969040","5","I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT, SO I BOUGHT 2","THIS WAS MY 2ND FIRE STICK, I BOUGHT ONE OFF OF A FRIEND AND LOVED IT SO MUCH THAT I HAD TO BUY ANOTHER ONE. IT DOES NOT COME JAIL BROKEN AS I KNEW THAT, THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I BOUGHT IT. I WANTED TO SEE IF I COULD JAILBREAK IT MYSELF AND I DID. IT IS A REALLY EASY AND SIMPLE PROCESS. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT THE FIRE STICK COULD REPLACE YOUR EXISTING CABLE SERVICE BUT TO ME I WOULD BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THAT. IF YOU LIVED IN A APARTMENT AND ONLY HAD ONE TV THEN YES THAT COULD WORK, I HAVE A 3 BEDROOM HOME AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT I WOULD NEED ATLEAST 6 FIRE STICKS, NOT GONNA HAPPEN LOL. AND SOMETIMES THE LIVE TV JUST ISN'T RELIABLE AND SOME SERVICES YOU WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IF YOU DIDN'T JAILBREAK YOUR DEVICE. THE FIRST FIRE STICK THAT I HAD JUST DIED ON ME THE SECOND DAY THAT I HAD IT, NO POWER AT ALL, COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT, LUCKILY I GOT IT REPLACED AND I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS SINCE. THE VOICE FEATURE IS KIND OF GIMMIKE I WOULD SAY IF ITS JAILBROKEN BECAUSE ALEXA DOES NOT UNDERSTAND MOST OF THE COMMANDS, BUT WITH THE REGULAR FEATURES SHE WORKS JUST FINE. TO INSTALL THIS IS VERY EASY, ITS BASICALLY JUST PLUG AND GO, YOU LOG INTO YOUR AMAZON.COM ACCOUNT AND FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS. WHEN YOU NEED TO TYPE IT IS VERY ANNOYING BECAUSE THERE IS NO PHYSICAL KEYBOARD, SO I WENT ON AMAZON AND BOUGHT A ADD-ON KEYBOARD REMOTE FOR THE FIRE STICK AND LIFE HAS BEEN MUCH EASIER, IT'S IPAZZPORT KP-810-30B MINI BLUETOOTH KEYBOARD, I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS FOR FIRE STICK USERS","[]","B00ZV9RDKK","B075X8471B","AHHCWGPK3CBVFIES3X6IDOCMQYHA","2017-08-20 14:40:13.807","7","True","502"
"430594","5","Sharp looking box that works very well for the RSP1","I replaced my generic-looking grey aluminum RSP1 case ordered on Ehh-Bay with this one.  Never liked my grey metal case because it was too big in height and didn't hold the RSP1 board securely.  This one, at $30, cost twice as much but it looks much sharper, is &#34;right sized&#34; for the SDRPlay RSP1 (not too big in height) and includes both an FM broadcast band filter and a black carrying case.  It's nicely priced for all that is included in the kit.  Note that assembly is not as easy as it might seem.  Take your time, though, and you'll get it all put together.\\n\\nThe tiny FM trap which fits inside the case works well in filtering out the local FM broadcasters.  A 10 kW FM transmitter only 2 miles away is only slightly audible when I crank the RSP1 IF gain all the way up to max.  The FM trap doesn't seem to hurt reception of the VHF aircraft band or the local NOAA weather stations around 162.5 MHZ so the skirts of the filter seem to fall off OK.\\n\\nOnly two small complaints.... (1) If you put the FM trap inside the metal box it will be sitting very close to the RSP1 circuit board.  If the FM trap metal box begins to come loose and twist after multiple connects to your antenna system there is the possibility of shorting out some of the connections on the RSP1 PC board.  I slipped a very thin piece of foam rubber between the FM trap and the RSP1 board so that nothing could ever be shorted out at some future date if the antenna input becomes loose.  You might also want to put some foam rubber on top of the extremely small antenna nano-connector that plugs directly onto the RSP1 boards so that it has some force pressing down on it and stays in place.  (2) Two of the black screws that hold the front/back plates onto the case didn't want to go into the case totally flush.  Not a big deal in my opinion.\\n\\nBottom line, it's a good value and makes your RSP-1 look very sharp.  It also supplies a lug that allows you to ground the metal container to help avoid nearby RFI noise if so desired.  Well deserving of 5-stars.","[]","B06XDQ1P1F","B06XDQ1P1F","AHEMJ45UT73AWCN4E4EAL4VQUOPA","2017-10-10 23:12:29.948","3","True","502"
"632262","3","Of quality and quality control.","Update: After I posted the review below, Tonor reached out to me offering a full refund. I accepted. Tonor's concern for my satisfaction has been remarkable. I am entirely satisfied with our transaction. Tonor's fantastic customer service has not altered my experience of the functional characteristics of the microphone itself. While the performance of the microphone did not meet my needs, I appreciate that others may have needs which the performance will satisfy (and may even be optimal).\\n-----\\nI purchased the &#34;Tonor USB Professional Condenser Sound Podcast Studio Microphone for PC Laptop Computer Apple Mac Upgraded Version - Plug and play, Black&#34; with moderate expectations. Sure, it isn't advertised (or priced) as a professional-grade device but one does expect fitness for advertised purposes.\\n\\nThe mic arrived quickly. Installation on various computers (all running macOS or Linux) was truly plug-and-play. I evaluated the mic's performance across several machines, operating systems, and environments. The sensitivity of the mic was unacceptably low. When I digitally amplified the signal to obtain greater sensitivity, a low-frequency hum became obvious. If this were a mic with an analog interface, I'd have been looking for a ground-loop problem. But all the analog works are internal to this mic.\\n\\nI contacted Tonar regarding the unacceptable performance. They agreed to send a replacement mic, which arrived a few days later. The replacement mic does have greater (although, still not entirely &#34;good&#34;) sensitivity. The resulting signal still requires digital amplification, although less amplification than the original mic. A low-frequency hum is still present but, with less amplification, is less problematic.\\n\\nGiven moderate expectations, performance of the replacement mic is acceptable. With a bit of post-processing, I get reasonable sound. Although, the necessary post-processing makes the mic less useful for &#34;live&#34; functionality. Given an amenable audio-subsystem (so, depending on your determination and operating system), one could possibly string together and apply the necessary audio filters automagically -- making &#34;live&#34; use a reasonable possibility. I've not yet done this.\\n\\nIn my experience, one should have modest expectations for this mic's performance. Nonetheless, Tonor provided notable customer service.","[]","B01142EPO4","B01142EPO4","AFYWFVOANXI4BK6T6PHGX7WN4FEA","2017-08-05 21:47:15.802","5","True","502"
"604543","5","Amazing receiver for the price!  Everything you'd want/need in your home theater!","We recently moved into a new house that has a dedicated theater room but the equipment left by the previous owner was...to put it nicely...old.  The projector didn't have HDMI and the receiver was as much of a dinosaur in weight as in age.  We decided if we were going to buy a house with a theater, we needed to do it right.  While I'm not new to A/V I am new to dedicated home theater equipment, so I immediately called around to a few local professionals who design and install this stuff for people to find out what kind of equipment they work with and recommend and this receiver was at the very top of the list for really good equipment on a budget.  We took the &#34;budget&#34; part even further and bought this in new/used condition from a great Amazon seller and it arrived packaged, looking and behaving like brand new!  Installation and set up was a breeze and within 30 minutes of opening the box, I was playing music from my phone through the speakers in the theater via bluetooth, watching TV from my Xfinity box, movies streamed via Plex to my Roku Ultra and played on my blueray DVD player and the receiver juggled it all like a champ!  We currently have older but still very good Polk audio wall mounted speakers and the sound is just incredible!\\n\\nIn case you're wondering, we paired this with a new/refurbished Epson 3000 home cinema HD 3D projector and are beside ourselves with how amazing the experience is!  These two play very well together.  My only complaint is that the remote has to be pointed right at the receiver, which is a pain if you're sitting on the front row of our theater seats and have to crane your arm up and backward to the back corner of the room where all the equipment is housed, but we plan to integrate to a single remote that doesn't rely on directional IR so that won't be a problem for long.\\n\\nAll in all I am really pleased with this receiver for the price and while it has way more features than we will probably ever use, it does exactly what we want it to do, and very quickly and very well and we couldn't be happier!  I HIGHLY recommend this receiver for use in a home theater setup!  For the record I did not receive this for free or at a discount.  Hope this helps!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71D6qTLvSZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71D6qTLvSZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71D6qTLvSZL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DepAtPclL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DepAtPclL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DepAtPclL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NR4Ag0C+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NR4Ag0C+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NR4Ag0C+L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71X5qgc6vjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71X5qgc6vjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71X5qgc6vjL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01BY7YUKI","B01F7SU6BM","AE4SBEJSCJAWM7CRKJDBQF3O7RGA","2017-04-07 17:29:17.000","54","True","502"
"687832","3","boots quick, but has its issues","I am the stereotypical purchaser of this item, I suspect: I have a MBP 5,5 from mid 2009.  It has always done what I wanted, but creates a lot of heat in some situations and, as the original HD was nearing full, I was tempted by the siren's song of SSD.  So I got this drive and ordered the company's 2x4gb ram upgrade for the same machine.  I had an existing SATA to USB (2) cable and so I was fairly sure I could clone my HD to the SSD and the swap the new one in.  That much went well; for reference, my drive was over 200gb and it took about 3.5 hours to transfer and verify to the SSD through that USB 2 port/cable.  Now for the bad news; the RAM upgrade failed.  I tried to two chips in both slots, I seated and reseated them, but only got the 3 beeps of death whenever I tried to start up.  There is ferment on the internet about flexing things with screwdrivers, but I don't think that's a good idea warranty-wise.  Just my two cents.  The drive boots faster and is quieter and it may also even run down the battery slower; I have no benchmark data to pass along sorry.  But it has given me at least a couple of problems: the first is the very well-documented one of causing the thermal sensors to turn the fans on more often and for longer periods.  The internet also offers workarounds for that, but I can't endorse any of those here.  One other problem is when waking from a long period of lid-down sleep the touch pad refuses to work unless you restart. Consequently I leave it to sleep open now.  I undertook these upgrades because of the new drive's capacity (the SSD is 2x the old HD) and speed and, just for full-disclosure's sake, because I test drove a new MBP with the &#34;power bar&#34; and I hate that thing.  I likes my esc key! So I might downgrade to a MB sometime in the future whenever I really, really, really need a new one.  Given what has occurred, however, to do over again I would likely just buy an external drive for more storage and leave well-enough alone.  PS--I did return the ram chips and amazon refunded me.","[]","B01IAGSD68","B078YN3VW8","AFGHVABGKIDJKSIBVONVLZLJQYWQ","2017-04-26 23:02:20.000","0","True","502"
"699976","5","High quality all around.","This little guy is perfect for me in three ways:\\n\\n1. Two USB charging ports\\n2. BT input to AUX output\\n3. Clear voice microphone input\\n\\nWhether it's me charging two accessories or driving with a passenger having two ports is critical for me these days. I suspect two or more ports is critical for anyone driving these days. Dash Cam, Smartphone, backup battery charger, etc.\\n\\nI would prefer not to have to plug and unplug my phone every time I got in my car to listen to music. The BT adapter and AUX output makes it dead simple to connect and play my music. In fact, my music is usually playing when I start the car because I leave it plugged in and my phone connects as I approach the car.\\n\\nI used to use a BT receiver that claimed to be able to make and receive calls. Without fail every time I accepted a call the other party couldn't hear me. I even put the mic right up to my mouth and no joy! It was a joke! As long as I have had it I have made 10 or more calls on this device and even at a further distance than my previous device the other side can hear me just fine. I have received reports that it's not HD voice, but they can hear me with no trouble/background noice and I don't have to touch my phone.\\n\\nHonorable mention for me is fast charging on my S8 and FM transmission.\\n\\nI love being able to top up my Galaxy S8 even on a quick 15-20 minute car ride. This next one is a little crazy, but I have had this idea to put a sign on my car to have people tune in to the radio station that I am transmitting on and have them text or shout requests to me as we are driving together. I prefer the AUX connection for better quality audio, but the novelty is there to fulfill my whimsy.\\n\\nOf note:\\n\\nWhen I used the FM transmitter I had to turn my vehicle volume higher and when there was no music playing there was a buzzing noise that, to me, was more than just white noise from the speakers. Not a huge deal for me because the audio sounded great on the station I chose, but something to be aware of.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614zH4OiAHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614zH4OiAHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614zH4OiAHL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61b5rvihglL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61b5rvihglL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61b5rvihglL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716FMZVcJFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716FMZVcJFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716FMZVcJFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tiUQ1L2hL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tiUQ1L2hL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tiUQ1L2hL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B0719SNR5N","B0719SNR5N","AG3T5NIYIEIRZUZMPYG5J6JXHITA","2017-09-27 16:29:47.120","0","False","502"

The space bar is very short and the ? key is just to the right of the space bar so it is VERY easy to hit that key when trying to hit the space bar. (See below for more details)\\n\\nI bought 5 cases to try them all out and compare them. By clicking on my Amazon name I think you will be able to see my reviews of all 5 once they are all up. In the attached photos I am showing this case compared to the Logi (Logitech) Focus keyboard case.\\n\\nBasically, this Alpatronix CASE is one of the nicest of the bunch!\\n-  The case holds the iPad well and safely. Though it does not have anything that encloses the corners, the corners are well protected because the iPad is set into the case deep enough.\\n-  The leather seems to be good quality and the case is very handsome and professional looking.\\n-  That said, it is heavy and very thick. (See photo) That is great for protection but can be an issue for those of us that walk and bus everywhere and need to fit everything into a backpack.\\n\\nSadly, they Keyboard is sorely lacking! (See photos)\\n-  The keys and the keyboard are slightly smaller than all the other keyboards I compared. I suppose you could get used to it, but I found the other keyboards much more comfortable to type on.\\n-  As mentioned above the space bar is extremely short.\\n-  The keyboard setup might work for “hunt and peck” two finder typists\\n-  But for anyone who is a touch typist and switches between their regular computer(s) and iPad I think this would be a nightmare.\\n-  Lastly, as compared to the Logi Focus & Zagg Folio, the keys are very flat. The other two have a very slight curvature to the keys which makes typing on them much easier and pleasant.\\n-  It is nice how the keyboard can be removed but even when removed the case does not fold back flat so I am not actually sure of the purpose of the removable keyboard - unless it is to be able to use it further away from the iPad.

But car audio installation is a different beast. So here's my 2 cents that might save another customer hours of aggravation if they plan to install this themselves.\\n\\n1) get an ANL fuse that can handle 60-80 amps. Running 8 gauge power to your battery with no additional fuse to separate it from the source can be dangerous and the fuses in the sub aren't going to cover this.\\n\\n2) this sub had a BUILT IN LINE OUT CONVERTER, therefore you do NOT need one of those little LOC boxes that most people buy for their subwoofer and amp kits.HOWEVER, The cables that come with the sub make you THINK you need one because they are RCA female to high level speaker input.But there's a bridge within the amp itself and you will need to cut this cables RCA ends off and splice the R positive and L positive, R negative and L negative into your cars speaker harness using a T-TAP and quick connect that you can get from any advance auto parts.\\n\\n3) Tap the high level input into your cars existing subwoofer, NOT YOUR REAR OR DOOR SPEAKERS, or it will sound like crap.\\n\\n4) you DO NOT NEED TO RUN A REMOTE WIRE. This was my mistake but I misread the instructions and wasted SO much time attempting to run a remote wire to my head unit and fuse box that I didn't even need, because at the high level input it has an intelligent turn on that senses audio and turns the sub on by itself.\\n\\nBreak the sub in slowly, do not turn up the setting for a few days and let that speaker move air without going crazy. Once it's broken in, enjoy the little powerhouse that this lightweight little sub is. In my Civic Si it rattles my windows and fills the car with the most crystal clear, tight heavy bass without being overwhelming.

"511242","5","Perfect fit, with easy removal stick-out if you like","I bought several versions of the JetDrive, including this Lite 360. I love the options of being able to select different JetDirve versions for my need, especially the ability to select &#34;longer&#34; version so it is easy to insert or remove the drives from the laptop slots. I have at home MacBook Air 13&#34;, MacBook Pro retina 13&#34; and MacBook Pro 15&#34; retina, all of them are mid to late 2013 versions.\\n\\nFor my own MacBook Pro 15&#34;, the &#34;correct&#34; version is supposed to be JetDrive Lite 360. However, after checking the specifications on the manufacture's web site, I realized that Lite 350 version is actually a little longer, and many online reviews mentioned that it might be difficult to remove those drives if they fits too tight and close to the edge of the MacBook. Being a frequent digital camera user, I need the SD card slot for my camera memory card downloading. I don't want the hassle of peeling the card off the card slot. The Lite 350 version does stick out about 3 - 4 mm from the slot, but the benefit of easy removal would save me much time and less headache in the long run. So far, I have never experienced any hit or obstruction because of the small extrusion.\\n\\nSame thing for our MacBook Pro retina 13&#34; which is supposed to use Lite 330, but I got this Lite 360 for it to make sure I have the extra edge sticking out. As a matter of fact, our MacBook Air has to use the Lite 130, the longest version, and it fits snugly right to the edge of the MacBook: so comfortable that it is the hardest one to pull out!\\n\\nThose cards fit the MacBook SD card slot very tight, and it is very unlikely to accidentally remove or damage by daily use or carrying around. I admit somebody might not like the cosmetic appearance of the sticking out card, but you get another benefits: you can see the printed card size from the stick out strips, making it easy for me to know which card I am using without going through the Finder!\\n\\nNo need to say more about the performance. These cards are very fast, and I have no problem watching full screen HD videos off the drive. I highly recommend it for all MacBook users.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pdLCp5xHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pdLCp5xHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pdLCp5xHL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00K73NWK0","B00K9ZS12A","AHXXZZJDG6OPJO6VCAEX767ILM6Q","2017-05-24 02:42:03.000","1","True","502"
"278032","5","Best portable mini itx period!","I purchased this case for a mini ITX build and could not be more pleased. I use this build for a portable astrophotography machine and it is perfect. Since I knew I was going to take this thing outside I wanted to put in water cooling. This case allowed me enough space to put in a ASUS ROG Strix Z270I Gaming Motherboard, G.SKILL 32GB (2 x 16GB) Ripjaws V Series DDR4 PC4-25600 3200MHz , 7700k CPU, EVGA GeForce GTX 1070 SC GAMING ACX 3.0 Black Edition, a Samsung 960 EVO Series - 500GB NVMe - M.2, a Samsung 850 EVO 1TB 2.5-Inch, a EVGA CLC 120 Liquid / Water CPU Cooler RGB and all powered by a EVGA SuperNOVA 750 P2, 80+ PLATINUM 750W. All of that is in this box and the build went as quickly as any I have done in much larger cases. So, while this is not the smallest on the market, this is by far the most versatile and easy to build in mini ITX case I have ever worked in. For you builders out there that are wondering about cable management, it took a little more planing than it does in larger cases but with some patience, zip ties and Velcro cable ties I was able to get it nice and tidy and keep them from interfering with the airflow. Last thing I will mention, the case is solid, as I mentioned, I wanted this for a portable astrophotography pc. This thing goes everywhere with me and it has yet to have any issues from being moved around and being crammed into the back of my suv with my cameras, telescopes, lenses and tripods. While I don't throw it around or drop it I am not exactly gentle with it either. In my opinion as a pc builder and as a user, this case is worth it. Quick note, this case has an E-Sata port on the front, I use it for my external storage hard drive Buslink P5-10TN 10TB, so if you do video or photography this case will work for you. No need to load the box down with large mechanical hard drives, all you need is an external drive that can take advantage of the E-Sata and you will be good to go when you are on the road with your portable PC.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61q0Em5cI7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61q0Em5cI7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61q0Em5cI7L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vtmT+m8YL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vtmT+m8YL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vtmT+m8YL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Gxp7oLW7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Gxp7oLW7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Gxp7oLW7L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yG6WBpGJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yG6WBpGJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yG6WBpGJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B006W99Y96","B006W99Y96","AFKIWVMIFZBGCDWCD3NZJKVOB6IA","2017-06-07 03:01:28.000","1","True","502"
"202401","4","Over all I really like it. It is pretty compact","I've only had this laptop for a few days, But I figured since there isn't much information online about it I'd post a review. Over all I really like it. It is pretty compact. With it just a little over 4 pounds its lighter then going with a similar priced similar spec gaming laptop. The fingerprint scanner works great. Id say Asus line about the swipe scanner being more reliable is true. Moisture, dirt, ect, Does not effect it like a regular fingerprint reader. I've yet to have it not work. This to me is awesome cause the fingerprint reader was one of the draws to this series of laptops. 512gig ssd was also. Its quick and works well. There is also an empty 2.5 bay. So mine is at 1TB with two 512ssds. Its worth noting though on mine the empty bay was not accessible by just removing the memory access door. That just allows access to the M.2 factory ssd and the single 8gb memory stick. The other 4gb of memory is made on to the board from what I understand. I purchased planning on running it with the stock 12gb though so that isn't a problem for me. But its probably worth mentioning. The screen looks good to me and is not glossy which was something I prefer on a laptop. Keyboard and track pad both work well and are comfortable to use. SD card reader also works well. I still prefer a laptop with an optical drive. So that's another plus to me. In fact I would have liked to have had bluray.\\n\\nNow for the negative, It does not have USB C. I don't have a need for this right now, But i'm sure that will change sooner or later. I took the gamble that it would be later.\\nThe keyboard is not back lit. I really wish it was. I think they all should be. You can always just turn it off if you don't need/want it. If its not an option your just doing with out.\\nThis is only a Dual Core 7th gen I7. This can be both good and bad. Plus side it does have good battery life and if that's a priority then the dual core is not a negative at all. Performance wise though this is a negative.\\n\\nIts a solid laptop and I'd recommend it. If it had USB C, I would have given it 5 stars.","[]","B06XW6XZ85","B06XW6XZ85","AETV4JVQNLLVL6MZ7AYET4HC5HBQ","2017-07-14 18:19:30.216","36","True","502"
"255029","5","A proper projector with proper bang for your buck!","I do love this projector by Elephas. It's small enough to fit in my knapsack and along with an android TV box, makes for the perfect movie viewing experience with family and friends.\\n\\nIt comes well packaged was a cinch to setup. In the box there's the projector of course (with lens cover attached), along with a remote, the power cable, a 3.5mm plug to 3 RCA A/V cable and manual. It would have been proper nice if a HDMI Cable was included but maybe I'm asking for too much here. The projector is just about 1500 Lumens as is advertised. I placed it on my entertainment centre, between my ceiling light and the projection screen and was able to see content even with the light on, though of course it was obviously not as clear as with the light off. I have a slightly cheaper projector I bought just a little over a year ago on Amazon and it isn't nearly as bright as the Elephas and just couldn't show much content with the room light on. The remote is simple yet effective and responsive. I was able to navigate myself through the menu and settings very easily. I consider myself a bit of a technophile but navigating through the same should be easy even for someone unfamiliar with similar technology.\\n\\nAfter setting the parameters to my preferred specifications I connected an android tv box via the HDMI port and selected a movie I knew was in HD. I was super pleased. It showed just fantastic and the built in speaker sounds pretty decent for such a small projector. It's loud enough to enjoy a movie without the need for additional audio equipment. There's also keystone correction to get rid of the trapezoid distortion and achieve a picture perfect view of your content. Use the lens adjustment to easily correct blur and bring your content into focus.\\n\\nIts also a rather quiet projector and never interrupted my viewing experience. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an inexperience but proper quality projector. Just make sure you have a good HDMI cable, which makes for a much easier and quicker setup. I find it extremely enjoyable with an android tv box pre-installed with KODI, because this actually converts the projector into a smart projector. You can access the android playstore and all it's yummies.\\n\\nJust a quick note, the lens protector will only go back on when the lens is retracted.","[]","B01GNLY3CK","B01GNLY3CK","AHMGXHXTGTPW3HGWNB56QOZU2ZUA","2017-02-02 07:36:30.000","1","True","502"
"661138","2","Overpriced and overrated. Strongly suggest listening to one before purchasing to keep from being disappointed.","I ordered a &#34;new - open box&#34; Tivoli Model One in black ash/silver from a third-party seller for $99. This item ended up showing signs of excessive moisture with some mold on the exterior and a musty smell, but I decided to try it out before sending it back. I put this right next to my Sangean WR-15 and was just as disappointed in the Tivoli as I was in the Sangean. Where the Sangean is mostly a muddy mess with too much low-end, the Tivoli is a muddy mess with too much mid-range. Although the two radios sound quite a bit different, both suffer from an incredible lack of definition. A lot of reviews of the Tivoli say that it is &#34;bright&#34; compared to similar radios- which is true- but it still does not have a full sound.\\n\\nAnother feature other reviewers rave about is the radio tuner. Yes, the dial is nice and smooth. No, I did not find it to tune into stations any better than any other radio. Additionally, the Model One that I tried had a persistent hum on all stations.\\n\\nI don't consider myself an &#34;audiophile&#34;, but being a musician I think that I have an ear for decent sound. Currently, I find that I am using my JBL Charge 2+ much more than any other sound system I own. The JBL has a full... dare I say even a &#34;complete&#34; sound compared to anything similar to its size.\\n\\nOverall, I think that the Tivoli Model One is an overpriced showpiece. It sounds exactly how it looks: vintage. I truly see no reason that this costs twice that of a Sangean, which is also overpriced but very similar quality. Ultimately, I suggest not paying full price for the Tivoli or the Sangen or having high expectations for either. They are decent, but no where near deserving of the rave reviews they received.\\n\\nGranted, it's totally possible that the signs of moisture in the Model One I received attribute to the lack of performance. If I find the need to waste $150 to try another Model One in the future and have a different experience, I will update this review.","[]","B00006I5WK","B009P22FGQ","AFODOMP6666COWLIMQTBGU2M3ZPQ","2017-04-30 04:04:05.000","0","False","502"
"574559","1","Decent arm but poorly design mounting/clamping mechanisms that can be dangerous during assembly.","Edit 9/2017:  Seriously don't waste your time with this mount.  I recently purchased the Amazon Basics arm for another display and it is light years ahead of this thing in terms of mounting design, height adjustment and arm length and general quality.  The Ergotech arm is &#34;solid&#34; but aside from that it's not nearly as well designed as the Amazon arm.  I'm trying to move it from one spot to another and it's a real chore with it's terrible mounting plate and the lack of an integrated adjustment knob on the bolt not to mention the cheap steel plate (see pictures) that mounts under the table.  I'm deathly afraid the table will snap due to the limited area of pressure with this plate vs the Amazon one.\\n\\nOriginal review:\\nWhile the arm itself may be ok... the mounting mechanisms are both poorly designed and dangerous.\\n\\nI'm sitting here with a cut finger from the shards of metal produced when you try to use the desk mount which has a horrible mounting plate design.\\n\\nThe instructions show using the plate in the photo as the under desk &#34;plate&#34; that the large bolt presses against to clamp to the table/desk.  Apparently the bolt is supposed to somehow just ride along that middle hole to keep it centered, I guess?  The instructions show this.\\n\\nThis design causes a number of issues.  First the bolt shreds the hole creating those shards/shavings of metal in the picture.  These are very sharp and I was cut while attempting to handle the plate pieces.  Secondly the plate turns and locks up on the bolt to the point where you cannot turn/tighten the bolt anymore (since the plate strikes the clamp as it turns) and you cannot tighten the unit to the desk.\\n\\nThere is no logical reason why they didn't provide a proper plate to use for clamping against the bottom of the desk other than being cheap.  I am now sitting with a 150 dollar mount that I cannot use as designed and am forced to either fashion a proper plate myself or return the unit for something that actually works.  Of course I could drill into my desk and use the hole mount, or drill into my wall... but I did not buy this mount so I could start destroying things simply to make it work.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dGeJAgGeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dGeJAgGeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dGeJAgGeL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zjnG+EJxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zjnG+EJxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zjnG+EJxL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B015ROFFGM","B015ROFFGM","AE4CPMDSKZKOBFQFZS7JFSBLVZRQ","2017-07-14 03:05:08.681","4","True","502"
"115420","5","This is a great kit, just add a micro-sd card and you are ready to have fun","Pros:\\nThis SBC needs at least 5 volts and 2 amps, 2.5 amps is better. The power supply that comes with this kit provides that power. If you use another source make sure you use a good USB cable to feed it power.\\nThis SBC is rock solid. It runs Chromium browser just fine. I have created a video with it but that is not it's forte. It is best suited for surfing the web and addressing email, or as a hotspot, nas, repeater, piratebox, etc...\\n\\nCons:\\nDoesn't have a power switch but it only pulls 2 watts or less powering a fan so why turn it off? If you feel you must turn it off you can with the halt command which brings the power usage down to 1 watt or less still powering the fan. Then just remove the power.\\n\\nOther Thoughts:\\nThis SBC is sensitive to under-voltage so if you are powering it with a battery make sure it can put out a solid 5 volts and 2 amps or more and that the USB cable is high quality so you don't get too much voltage drop across the cable.\\nIf you push it to 100% on all 4 cores it can heat up and start throttling even with the heatsink kit. A 5 volt 40 mm fan running on 3 volts can cool it right down to safe temperatures. You can get the 3 volts from the GPIO.\\nThere is no mystery to how this SBC boots an OS. It looks for the fat32 boot partition on the micro-sd card and boots from there. It can either boot an OS in another partition on the micro-sd card or on a USB flash drive, or another storage device. There is no MBR or such, just the boot partition. So, you can copy the files from the partitions of the image you download into the respective partitions on the storage device.\\nUsing Linux I use losetup and mount to mount the partitions of the image and then use rsync to copy the files. I am sure there is a way to do it with MS windows but I am not familiar enough with that OS. You can also use dd in Linux but you lose control of the partitions size and locations.\\nSearch the web for info about this SBC. There is a lot of projects and how-tos.","[]","B01C6FFNY4","B01C6FFNY4","AEUEHC3NJTM56SPHAFVDAY5GTODQ","2017-03-06 22:00:50.000","1","True","502"
"678577","5","Perfect Traveling Companion After Slight Modification","I bought an identical unit from another seller but can add some information on this unit.  In the SD card slot, it will read up to a 32gb card; it will accept a 64gb card but will only access 32gb of it; and a 128gb card causes the unit to 'freeze' and you have to unplug it to get it to reboot.  All of the cards mentioned above work fine when connected to the player via a USB card reader plugged into the USB port.  It reads and plays everything I have from a 2tb Seagate Back-up Plus hard drive connected via USB.  I use this when we travel because it is easy to hook up to TV's in hotel rooms via a HDMI cord.  I was not thrilled that it needed the included 'wall wart' power supply.  Through a lot of experimentation, I have found that I can power this via a USB cable that has the appropriate barrel connector to fit the unit.  But, as soon as I add a USB extension, it does not work.  What I finally did was to construct my own USB cord from another 'wall wart' supply that had the correct barrel plug.  I cut off the 'wall wart' and soldered on a USB plug (from Adafruit) to give me a fairly long and adequate gauge  USB cable with a barrel plug.  I can now power the unit from an Anker lithium battery pack (for hours) or from any number of USB charger units that I take on trips.  And some TV's have a USB port and some of these put out enough power for this unit.  So now, I can leave the included 'wall wart' at home to save packing space and weight!  I also found that the 'power on' LED was a bit difficult to see.  After taking the unit out of the case, I found that this surface mounted LED was pointing 'up' rather than 'out'.  I glued a small piece of reflective cardboard behind the LED to reflect the light out of the tiny hole in the front of the unit.  With the modifications of the power cord and LED I find that this is the perfect traveling companion and I can have all of my music, pictures, and videos in one tiny package!  You might want to check out some software that I have found useful:  MakeMKV and Handbrake (converts MKV files to smaller mp4 files).","[]","B01ICN8T5Y","B01ICN8T5Y","AHBJ67EBAFQC53O3JH2NDTNHPWBA","2017-03-16 20:45:34.000","0","False","502"

The first one I got bricked within a few days of use, but Amazon replaced it quickly, and the second one has been a very capable machine. I've used it as my travel laptop and back up to my gaming desktop, and it gets moderate to heavy use. I haven't had a single hardware problem since that first hiccup.\\n\\nIt's got commendable battery life, the charger is a normal size and easy to stow in your back, and it only weighs 6lbs, which isn't too bad for a machine with these specs. The hybrid SSD/HDD works very well, and the boot is incredibly fast.\\n\\nPros:\\nPowerful for the price - I can run nearly any game on this without any issues. I'm not the type of gaming who has to push everything to max settings, and I don't play bleeding edge games, but everything from Diablo 3 and WoW to DOTA 2 and Civilization 5/6 work beautifully on this laptop. It's also the cheapest for the specs (or at least was, at the time).\\nNice layout and design - the black-lit red keys are a nice touch, and the keyboard layout are well thought out. The black anodized finish is really slick, for whatever that is worth.\\nSmall form factor for the specs - a lot of other gaming laptops are tanks; this one is relatively slim, and feels more elegant. It's also easier to travel with.\\n\\nCons:\\nHeat - not all that unusual for a gaming laptop, but this things get very, very hot after a few hours of graphics heavy use\\nTouchpad sort of sucks - I don't really use the laptop without an attached mouse, but when I have to, the built-in touch pad isn't very responsive. The buttons take a while to register presses, and it's very easy to accidentally hit it with your wrist given its position\\nWindows 10 support - this has probably been resolved by now, but I had some issues with upgrading this from Win 8 to Win 10. The video driver in particular, no matter how many times I reinstalled it, or tried beta versions, would continually crash and claim to have stopped running. It didn't actually interfere with gaming, but was very annoying as it popped up nearly hourly.","[]","B00T7XRGGC","B017TAWAVA","AFVL2K3MODCKCJFBGZILZDDXLSKQ","2017-02-07 21:37:36.000","0","True","502"

However, I was unable to get my Ooma VOIP telephone system to work when I connected the Ooma controller to the Orbi base Ethernet port.

I finally re-connected the R6300 router to the cable modem and Ooma controller (without disconnecting the Orbi system to the cable modem) and the VOIP system connected immediately.  If Orbi works with Ooma, I don't know how to do it.  I searched the Netgear web site/community FAQs without success.

I gave the Orbi a 4th star because their tech support did try to fix the problem; however, I ran up against the Amazon 30-day return window and sent the unit back for a refund.  I may have had a unit with bad ethernet ports, but that's only my guess.  Instead, I purchased a NETGEAR Nighthawk X4 AC2200 WiFi Range Extender (EX7300) [[ASIN:B01D6JEMWS NETGEAR Nighthawk X4 AC2200 WiFi Range Extender (EX7300)]] to work with my older Netgear R6300v2 router.  Everything works fine with great expanded WiFi coverage.  Netgear tech support was concerned and helpful.  The engineers were trying to replicate my problem using the Orbi & Ooma when I ran up against the 30-day guarantee window.  If I wasn't using my router for VOIP phone service, I would definitely buy the Orbi.","[]","B06XJNDYX8","B06XJNDYX8","AHAM5KZXUJGR4EI6ZSAARW5EZ6OQ","2017-04-25 03:11:16.000","3","True","502"

I guess I just fixed mine up a little better. *shrugs*\\n\\nI noticed someone complained about the long wait as this monitor powers on.

(arthritis in my right thumb) This fits the bill. It reacts instantly, clicks and scrolls easily. Since I'm not using it for anything more than that I can only speak to the comfort and ease of use. I haven't tried using the buttons on the side. BUT, I've tried clicking them and find it awkward with my bad thumb and the way they are positioned on the mouse itself. I don't know how long a charge lasts and I haven't found anything that speaks to it in the tiny little document that came with it. I used it for 8 hours a day without turning it off and it didn't appear to need a charge. I don't think there's an indicator that lets you know it's running low, that would be nice, since it's not just replacing a battery, it needs 2 hours to charge. (so have a back up mouse) I turned it off for the long Labor Day weekend and will turn it back on and continue to use it till it dies, at which time I will report how long the initial charge lasted for me.\\n\\nSome reviewers are saying the size is too big for them and awkward on the wrist. I will note that I use a gel wrist rest mouse pad and so for the past 24 hours of intense use, have not found it to be an issue.\\n\\nPros:\\nSize is easy on your hand, it's sort of humped up and your hand can rest on it and there's a groove for your thumb.\\nIt moves, scrolls and clicks easily\\nIt is very responsive\\nComes in a nice sort of padded drawstring carrying pouch\\nComes fully charged to use out of the bag\\nIt's attractive, seriously, it's a good looking piece of hardware.\\nCons: (1 star removal)\\nDocumentation is tiny, so tiny I had to use a magnifying glass, my reading glasses wouldn't do the trick\\nDocumentation is limited - no real information about the mouse, including how long a charge should last\\nIf the tiny piece of text that came in the bag is the &#34;user manual&#34; it says it includes in the packaging - someone needs to work on that!","[]","B074HYNMWG","B074HYNMWG","AE5LF7AXSOYKEVQUEZRZQWTB7IQQ","2017-09-03 02:13:51.673","1","False","502"

Good audio quality, a decent microphone, great comfort, construction is just okay, software not overly intrusive and easy to understand, buttons easy to use but all on the same side of the headset, great range, and nice cables included.\\n\\nThe audio quality is very good and gets a 4.5 out of 5. The surround is noticeable per zone and is great for gaming. The different mode/eq settings actually do make a difference. My only complaint is the bass is not as deep as other headsets I have had.\\n\\nMicrophone quality is clear with no feedback 4 out of 5. Noise Cancellation does not pick up my mechanical keyboard or fan even when on voice activation. My voice was quieter and sounded different compared with the Astro A50s that these replaced.\\n\\nI have had many over the ear headsets and these are definitely the most comfortable. The mesh earpads and upper pad are very soft. 5 out of 5\\n\\nConstruction is 3.5 out of 5. This headset is mostly plastic and does not feel cheap but I will have to see how they hold up over time. The upper pad is an adhesive sticker that came loose on the right side, ~15% of the total surface area after less than 1 week of use. It does not affect the use or comfort just annoying.\\n\\nThe Logitech Gaming Software makes any of their products very easy to use. If you already have any Logitech products using this software it will just add right in. 5 out of 5\\n\\nThe buttons all being on the left earpiece along with the volume dial is okay. Personally, I would have split things up and put the programmable control buttons on one side and the volume/power on the other. But the button each have a different shape so it is not inconvenient to determine which you are pressing. 4.5 out of 5\\n\\nThe range is fantastic 5 out of 5. I went over 50 feet away and outside and was still able to hear and be heard without distortion.\\n\\nThe receiver is just a USB adapter that can also tuck into left earpiece. The power cable to charge the headset can be used while the headset is in use. It is nylon braided and easily 8 feet long. 5 out of 5","[]","B0148NPJ78","B0148NPJ78","AHGHCDEDXBZSLTSPC5LXT3OEP4OA","2017-05-29 05:29:51.000","0","True","502"
"538764","4","Great for the price but has occlusion issues","I ordered these to give to my sister after the trade-show freebie buds she was using broke.  I also bought a pair for myself as a backup to the Yurbuds I had been using.\\n\\nThe fit is excellent.  They have an oval shape that fits the ear canal much better than the standard circle shaped buds. Also the offset and angled driver fits the contours of your concha and inter-tragal notch (bowl of the ear and notch at the bottom) very well.\\n\\nHow do they sound?  Pretty good. They seem to have a very flat response. Coming from the Yurbuds which spike at 4K and trail off from there, these seemed to be missing something in the midrange but they have the highs and the lows as well. (as long as you insert them deep enough in your ears.)  I work at a hearing aid company so I might bring them in sometime to test their frequency response more precisely.\\n\\nThe main thing I noticed was the Occlusion. (blocking of the ear canal) My Yurbuds did not occlude and I could hear outside noises pretty well.  These do occlude and thus block external sounds to some extent as well as amplify internal sounds like swallowing, breathing, etc.  Tapping the cord results in an audible sound in the ear.  The occlusion is the reason I only give it 4 stars, other than that, its a great earbud for the price and I'm sure I'd have similar complaints about any other occluding style earbud.\\n\\nUpdate:  I checked their frequency response in an OES (occluded ear simulator) coupler.  They do have a bit of a dip around 1KHz but they're pretty strong out to 10KHz with some response (25dB lower) out to 20KHz and beyond.  The graph shows both the occluded (jammed in you ears tight) and non-occluded (loosely placed in you ears) response to show how it affects the sound.  This difference may account for the wide variety of reviews on its bass response however this issue is not unique to this device. All earbuds exhibit this effect. Most people should be able to find a semi-occluding fit with the included silicone buds that gives them a relatively flat response out to 10KHz.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41muLmsnogL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41muLmsnogL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41muLmsnogL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B003EM8008","B07S764D9V","AFPCL2FYVVNDLRH2ZBYLH46LXE5A","2017-01-08 22:00:51.000","4","True","502"

We wanted a video doorbell at home because we always get a lot of people dropping stuff, and we want to keep an eye on who steps on the front door. This was the best option in terms of size and features, but definitely still has things to work on.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Clear video and audio\\n- Straightforward set up instructions and within the app\\n- Good control of motion sensor\\n- thing enough to be placed on existing doorbell switch location\\n\\nCons:\\n- $30/year subscription needed for video feed storage. Really? This is way more than iCloud storage!\\n- Slow initial feed. There's a delay on the video feed when starting, so you might loose if someone just stopped by to drop something\\n- Antenna battles with brick mounting. We have it installed on brick, and the feed seems to struggle with sending data out\\n\\nOverall is a good option, I hope that Ring come to its senses with their data storage plan. I was thinking to get a couple more cameras for the outdoors, but paying almost $100/month just for storage is ridiculous.\\n\\n1yr review: if I could give 0 stars, I would. The product has been spotty and the manufacturer service is terrible.\\n\\nIt doesn’t stream video fast enough, specially when ringing. It doesn’t ring our bell anymore, it get frozen all the time while trying to stream video. The installation was good, it worked as expected and we got the annual subscription. All of the sudden it stopped working, we tried everything the Cust. Service recommended and then they said they couldn’t replace the unit anymore... we’re gonna replace it for another option like Nest.\\n\\nUpdate: Ring customer service sent a replacement, after a few emails exchanged. They sent a replacement unit, after the 1yr. The new unit has a large heat difusser on the back...we ID that the sun and high heat was causing the other one to loose voltage. The new one works perfect.

"278972","3","Hopefully the current model is better than the one I bought four years ago","I bought this radio four years ago, and thought you'd might like to know how it fared. The version I got has a monochrome screen, so maybe the ones offered today with the color screen are better. In any case, on the positive, the sound quality is good. Nice and loud, with decent bass from the size speaker.  Nice that it has line out and line in, as well as headphone. The internet tuning service is OK once you figure out how to set it up - nothing special but you can add more stations and make favorites. I like that it remembers the last stations played - handy when you can't remember to log on to the site from your computer to save a station.\\nOn the downside, a few things that have annoyed me over the four years. 1) It takes a long time to start up - around a minute to start playing an internet station from when you first power up.  2) Related to this, the power on off button is right where you want to grab the radio when you need to move it around, so it's extremely easy to hit the button and turn it off, then you have to wait a minute before you get your music back. Annoying. 4) The batteries bounce around inside a little, so if you drop the radio, or knock it (even a little) power is disconnected for an instant and - guess what - you have to wait a minute before you start listening again.  5) The indicator for WiFi signal strength is hard to read.  On my amber screen, it looks like a little ice cream cone, and I never figured out how a strong signal looks different than a weak one. 6) Finally, and this is the most serious limitation,  even if you use the NiMh / Alkaline switch properly, the NiMh charging system is not very robust. For one thing, the only indicator is a flashing green LED for charging and a red LED for Low Batt -- and the red LED comes on only for a second or two, right before the whole thing shuts off. So you never really know the state of the charge as you use the radio. Also I used to leave the radio plugged in and charging for long periods, but I think that this &#34;cooks&#34; the batteries because although I started out getting the full 4-6 hours of continuous play, this diminished to zero after less than 75 charge cycles.","[]","B0085H18W4","B0085H18W4","AGFKMSTO2ME2NMONMM4QZP4DHYOQ","2017-03-01 04:01:45.000","3","True","502"
"24271","4","The rep there helped me to look at my IP address which was in fact a public address from RCN and he was saying it seems like RCN couldn't finish the activation of the modem on ...","I wanted to provide my feedback because I have a unique situation. My ISP is RCN lehigh valley and it states on their website that this modem and one other modem do not work on their 500Mbps and 1Gbps tier plans. I had read something that said they may have tested it on DOCSIS 3.1 but it's not certified yet. Well I thought no problem, I only pay for 155Mbps so I purchased this modem from Amazon anyway, figuring it will work in DOCSIS 3.0 mode, which a few reviews said it did. Well I called RCN trying to get the modem provisioned. 45 minutes go by trying on their end...the representative said they can see it online then it goes out, I had to unplug it 4 times for 30 seconds each, during which she was trying to re-provision it. Every time I plugged it back in the lights would all turn blue, the up arrow, down arrow, and globe were all solid blue. So it should work right? Nope there was still no access to the internet. So they finally asked me what is the name and model of the modem and look it up. They quickly stated that it is not compatible with their network which I promptly told them your website said it's for the fastest internet services that I don't have. They insisted it wasn't their problem and I had to call the manufacturer to see if they could help me. So I call Motorola, the wait time to speak to someone was estimated at 9 minutes and I ended up waiting 38 minutes. The rep there helped me to look at my IP address which was in fact a public address from RCN and he was saying it seems like RCN couldn't finish the activation of the modem on their end and maybe the person I had talked to there wasn't sure what they were doing. So I call RCN back and this time it was the same story, and they cannot help me to make the modem work.\\nSo ultimately it seems there is no &#34;switch&#34; so to speak to make the modem work as DOCSIS 3.0 if 3.1 is available. I did not think I would have this problem and have to send this back despite my hopes of future proofing and saving on my internet bill. I can't give it the full 5 stars because I didn't get to experience if it is good or not. Hopefully this helps someone else though.","[]","B0723599RQ","B091ZHX225","AFJYDH2Q5DGRDVT72R3GGMVAZPLQ","2017-10-29 00:26:22.375","1","True","502"

It ran an old OS that prevented access to the Google Play even if you wanted it AND even apps from the Amazon Appstore were limited! Amazon never sent software updates for it (typical of Android devices, in general). It had no SD slot so space was limited. Everything seemed limited. It had that old carousel layout which was kind of boring. BUT it did have an amazing set of speakers; I like that one speaker was on top and the other on the bottom. The screen was HD.

I play games, read books, and watch Netflix or Hulu, and I can still make through the day, plus some, before I ever need a recharge!

"477582","5","Great fit, great sound (with app)","I wanted to upgrade from my LG Tone HBS-700, which although they functioned well enough, I thought sounded pretty bad for music (they were just fine for podcasts/audiobooks). I also wanted something that would sound better than my wired earbuds (some $25 &#34;Ultimate Ears&#34; model that sound fine enough but nothing exciting).\\n\\nI don't have extensive headphone knowledge nor am I an audiophile. I researched these along with some alternatives (MEE Audio X7 Plus, Beats X, Airpods, JLab Epic2, and various other models mentioned by The Wirecutter in their workout headphones and earbuds reviews). I was looking for something not collar style nor &#34;true wireless&#34;. I don't have an iPhone so so W1 support doesn't matter to me and the X3s seemed to compare favorably in audio quality to the Beats X and Airpods (based on my experience with Apple earbuds, they never stay in my ears) while also being cheaper, especially when you catch them on sale.\\n\\nSo far my experience has been very positive. Audio quality is better than any headphones (earbuds or over ear, wired or wireless) that I've owned and bass is deep and rich - this is provided you use a different EQ setting with the MyAudio app because the default is a little dull (I like the &#34;Hi Def Audio&#34; preset). The app is needed on my Android phone to get battery status but it shows up automatically on my iPad. I was able to get a good secure fit with the medium Comply foam tips and wings in both casual-fit and sport-fit styles.\\n\\nWireless connectivity is not an issue in my testing. I can walk out of the room without my phone and the connection remains solid. As for the proprietary charger, it wasn't much of a factor for me since I inevitably need to carry dongles or multiple chargers for my other devices already, none of which are micro- or mini-USB. I didn't come across any wireless earbuds that charged with USB-C. Not having a flimsy port cover on them is nice too. Be warned they only come with the dongle and you will need a proper USB-A charger (or PC port) to charge them.","[]","B01M7NCT5O","B01M7NCT5O","AGTPAULORT27RVTSXCLXQTD7RUOQ","2017-06-17 02:16:01.916","1","True","502"
"442636","5","Holds up well and includes extra features","I'm using this with my Samsung NP900X3L-K06US laptop, which is an ultra-light ultra-slim 13.3&#34; laptop (under 2 lbs WITH the battery!)  The biggest issue I have with this laptop is the limitations on ports;  there really isn't room for a full-sized VGA, or even a Displayport, connector, so the external monitor port is micro-HDMI.  The adapter that comes with the laptop, as well as most of the replacement adapters such as https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JDRHQ58/ , are generally short and stiff (even though the picture on that adapter shows it bent -- it does not really bend easily).  As a result, one end of the cable is inserted into this tiny port on the laptop, and the other end goes to a relatively-heavy HDMI cable.  The outcome is predictable:  The weight of the HDMI connection puts stress on the adapter and the laptop port, and the connection fails fairly quickly unless you take pains to support the HDMI cable.\\n\\nBy contrast, this UGREEN adapter uses a more flexible bit of cable, fits the micro-HDMI port a bit better, and, despite having the weight of the little &#34;box&#34; on the end rather than just a connector, places far less stress on my laptop's micro-HDMI connector.  I've had this for a few months now, and I have a tendency to move my laptop around & pick it up etc., and although the signal recently can occasionally drop while I'm moving it, it's far more durable than the straight-style adapter mentioned above (including the one that came with the laptop.)\\n\\nFor this durability as well as the addition of a VGA connector, this adapter is worth the few dollars more that it may cost compared to other adapters.  The added micro-USB (for extra power) and audio ports are design niceties that I haven't needed, but they may surely come in handy at some point, and they are nice inclusions that none of the other micro-HDMI-to-HDMI adapters include.\\n\\nI have mixed feelings about the bright white plastic but, all things considered, would definitely recommend this adapter over any of the straight micro-HDMI-to-HDMI adapters available.","[]","B01ALGJSQE","B01ALGJSQE","AENSUXYGYP2UUS76QBPPWZMAPLUA","2017-09-28 06:34:22.123","9","True","502"

Whether you install a &#34;spinning platters&#34; 2.5&#34; hard drive or use SSD media, the two FW 800 ports allow zippier-than-USB 2 speeds (800 Mb/s &#62; 480 Mb/s) and daisy-chaining.  Heat dissipation will never be a problem, as while fanless, this enclosure's high-touch design, quality materials and robust construction make a fan unnecessary.  Likewise the included power adapter:  whether USB 3- or Firewire-connected, most drives will be entirely bus-powered, so just one cable to the host is usually all that is required.  Both FW 800 and USB 3 cables are included, a smart move by AKiTiO for this pricier-than-average enclosure.\\n\\nWhile my SSD media can read/write at about 550/500 MB/sec, over FW 800 to a 2008 iMac, this enclosure yields speeds of 72 MB/sec read and 61 MB/sec write:  two to three times faster than USB 2.  I consider speeds on this enclosure highly respectable and they prove that AKiTiO implemented the FW 800 and UASP electronics about as fast and well as is technically possible:  great job!\\n\\nOne thing to know if you are looking for an enclosure that lets you frequently swap different 2.5&#34; media in and out is that this one isn't &#34;easy access&#34;:  there are four screws and rubber sticky pads to cover them that makes this more of an &#34;install a drive and forget it&#34; style enclosure.  However, once the simple media installation is complete, this is a versatile device:  FW 800 + USB3 is just what your older/transitioning to new Mac needs, it travels well thanks to its rugged construction, and it will grow into the future with USB 3.\\n\\nSure, compared to others, you'll pay more for this enclosure, but I find every penny spent on the Neutrino U3+ to be well worth it.  5 stars!","[]","B00GRF1IPI","B00GRF1IPI","AGNC4BWTIGRGXAGUIS2UBKTPPRGQ","2017-05-30 19:07:51.000","1","True","502"

Don't expect professional results.\\n\\nTook me over an hour to setup my camera, and I admit I came close to throwing up my hands.  The solution was to choose a different model of camera from the setup menu than the model that I purchased, and that seemed to do the trick.  Other users have reported other issues and fixes.

The padded camera compartment holds my Canon SL2 with 18mm-135mm with the lens hood on and ready to go in the front facing orientation.  In that same compartment, I have a 55mm-250mm (lens cap mounted backward), 50mm, plus 24mm and 40mm pancake lenses.  All of this is in the dedicated camera compartment.  By the way, I have three of the well-padded separators left over and not in use.\\n\\nThere is plenty of room elsewhere in the bag for a Micro microphone, spare batteries, memory cards, cleaning kit, etc.  If I want, I can slip my Canon Vixia camcorder into the camera compartment and a 7&#34; monitor and shade in the computer/tablet compartment.  The tripod pouch securely accommodates my Gorilla Pod SLR-Zoom tripod, but could also be used for a large bottle of water, or 40-ounce malt liquor.\\n\\nAccess to my camera is easy due to the large opening on the side.  Much better than the Vanguard Adaptor in this respect.  And, the rest of my gear is very secure because of the tie down straps that limit how far the side access opens.\\n\\nThis is the only small bag I have found that combines real protection, flexible organization and comfortable wearing options.  I highly recommend the 150AW for small DSLR or mirrorless cameras.  If I decide to go with a larger body in the future, I will not hesitate to get the 250AW.\\n\\nSo, to sum it up... well made, good protection, easy access, plenty of space in a compact package and still light when fully loaded.  Since it is brand new, I cannot speak to durability.  There is, however, nothing that jumps out at me as an obvious potential durability issue. It appears to be very well made.","[]","B00U3TQO7G","B00U3TQO7G","AF3HVHLLNR4MZDMJHN7DENGCH5TQ","2017-11-10 00:57:20.351","4","True","502"
"941378","4","Great sound after burn-in!","I'll start with the bad news first. When I first tried these earbuds I was on an airplane flying to Dallas and I was not impressed. The sound wasn't right at all and they let in a ton of noise. Yes, I know these are designed for workouts, sports, etc., but I was hoping for a little more sound isolation. I suppose I've been spoiled by the excellent sound isolation of in-ear monitors and I'm not used to these partial in-ears. Anyway, back to the sound. I found the the highs to be crisp and clean and the bass to be quick and punchy. However, the mid-range is (to my ears) very recessed and it smothers the sound with a veil that not even the highs can totally overcome. Talk about a huge downer.\\n\\nNow the good news. When I got home from my trip I decided, given that I paid $150 for them, to give these buds another shot. I hooked them up at home and started a 40 hour burn-in period. Thankfully, it only took half of that time for the sound to change for the better. After around 10-20 hours of burn-in the mid-range started to really open up, stepped forward a notch or two out of the veil, and changed the overall sound of these ear buds. This little change with the mid-range made the SoundSport so much more enjoyable to use. Oh, and did I mention the wing tips? I've never used these before but I have to give Bose credit. They work fantastically well, keep the buds in your ears, and are supremely comfortable.\\n\\nFinally, it's worth mentioning that these wireless buds last approximately six hours on a full charge, take roughly two hours to charge, and connect via Bluetooth and NFC. So far I haven't experienced any drops in connectivity which is pretty amazing. Final verdict: I'm keeping them.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nWireless!\\nCharge with a standard micro-USB port.\\nSound great after a 10-20 hour burn it.\\nExtremely comfortable.\\nWing-tip ear buds.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nDon't bother listening to them until you burn them in.\\nVeiled sound when first used.\\nNo sound isolation at all.","[]","B01L7PSJFO","B0B62FJF1J","AG5T2LTVAVLLVJ27JVM3GXXGPNXA","2017-02-28 15:20:22.000","0","True","502"
"657006","4","It is pretty bulky, so for myself it wouldn't be a ...","So I never write reviews, I read them a lot but never give them the time of day to write them. I decided to write one for this bag ! ( I've only had it for a few days now) Wow, this bag.. It's big ! I have gotten a few bags for my camera equipment and they always end up being smaller than I thought. So I usually end up having to tote around a few bags, which is not convenient.\\n\\nThis bag is well made, thick (padded) and supportive both for the camera equipment and your back / shoulders. It is pretty bulky, so for myself it wouldn't be a bag to hike around with as I'm short and it goes past my bum. It carries my lenses (7 of them) I did have to finagle the compartments to fit my wide angle and my bulkier ones but the Velcro pieces allow for movement. It COULD have been a bit more roomy for lenses as I don't have any Telephoto lenses and I wouldn't be sure how they would fit. The bottom compartment is neat as it comes out. There are a few little pockets around it that could be used to carry extra memory cards or money?  Maybe. There are a lot of clips which is nice to secure everything. The tripod holder takes a bit to get used to but seems like it holds pretty tightly. The spot for the laptop (on the back) I didn't even know was there until a day later it seems pretty nice, nothing big will fit and I would only put in my Surface since it's thin. The straps feel nice, I have my bag filled up with a bunch of stuff, I doesn't seem to stay standing since it's now front heavy so I lay it down so it doesn't have a chance to tip.\\n\\nThe weather protective cover is nice but mine already ripped a little and I've had it for 3 days.\\n\\nThe reason I gave it 4 stars and it may be premature  and petty is because I bought some small locks for the zippers to make sure my stuff is safe and realized the hole on the zippers are too small to fit the small lock rod. I tried another type of lock that's a little smaller and still no luck. I couldn't find much on Amazon so I'll look at stores but as of now I do wish the zippers would fit some sort of lock.","[]","B00WQTLB0G","B00WQTLB0G","AGN3XTV7NN2XTT3EEADFMBCDD2WA","2017-08-22 21:12:24.825","0","True","502"
"60033","5","It just feels 'Right' for me.... 5 Stars","What to say....Finally a DSLR that feels 'familiar' to these old hands that have been holding Nikkormats and Nikon F's, FE's and F2's since the early '70's. My Wife and I are both dedicated Nikon fans, having accumulated a 'collection' of Nikon bodies and Nikkor lenses over the years.  This camera has so many features that appealed to me, but the most significant is that it has the ability to work with every Nikkor F-mount lens that we own, including a couple from the late 60's.  As soon as I started reading about it, I pre-ordered, before it was released, and waited, and have used it since December of 2013.  It is so meaningful and good in a very personal, familiar way, that I picked up a second black-body Df several months later.  No Regrets.\\n\\nIt has low  light performance that surpasses every ability I had even dreamed of. My old shoulder stock and cable releases and soft shutter releases all fit the threaded shutter button. It is light and compact compared to many of the other modern DSLR's. It has superb ISO range and is easily adjusted on-the-fly (once you master all the settings available by the external knobs and dials). It is extremely configurable via the many menu options. Battery life is excellent. It seems 'tough' or durable. It has not failed me through over ten thousand or so shots.\\n\\nI could go on and on, but the truth is, I am still learning to use all of the capabilities this camera has. Don't want to get into it that much? Set the Program on &#34;P&#34;, set your ISO to 'Auto' in the menu, and go take great photos immediately.\\n\\nThere is, I admit, an 'emotional attachment' in play for me and this camera. The ability to use it, as an instrument or 'tool of art' is beyond words - It approaches most closely to a 'feeling' or 'expression of emotion' -- And So, it is hard to sum it all  up it in words.\\n\\nMy advice is to try one, if you can, before you purchase. It may not be for everyone, but it sure feels 'Right' for me. Five Stars!","[]","B00GD1KCAI","B00PHRVUUK","AHDZWO5KZAZCVW7F7KCH3RUZVKRQ","2017-02-06 05:58:43.000","16","True","502"
"183754","5","The zmodo app is junk!!","I ONLY RATED THIS A 5 SO PEOPLE WILL SEE IT..... These cameras are junk. I just grudgingly put them back in the box and printed a return shipping label. I am out 65 bucks and a few more nights without home security cams. First of all I swear they were marked PRIME and I didn't get these for about 5 business days. I got them and was very excited. I sat down this morning with a cup of coffee my phone and laptop thinking the hardest part of these would be me screwing the cameras into my vinyl siding. I wish.. I plugged em up, attached the mounting pieces and antennas. I downloaded and created accounts on not just the &#34;Zmodo&#34; app but the &#34;Me share&#34; app as well. It wanted me to connect to a special network and then connect to my wifi. I was able to do this once. It would only detect one of my cameras. So I uninstalled the apps and retried the connection, this time and every remaining time I tried it would not give me the option to connect to the zmodo network. So with my one camera, I explored the picture and tried to see how fast the motion detector would alert me. This is where I got pissed. I searched for 3 hours online through forums and youtube and even called zmodo. No one could help me activate the motion detection device. I could only view live video. Then after I gave up at 4:55 PM, I got an alert from the &#34;me share&#34; app saying motion was detected ... get this.... at 4:06 PM. WOW! Good thing I wasn't laying in bed and a murderer decided to ascend the steps into my home. I would have been dead by the time the damn app let me know motion was detected. It's just not for me. I don't have 2 weeks to dedicate teaching myself about the installation and application specifics of a freaking camera. There are far too many other options out there and I honestly don't even feel safe with them. I considered hauling them out of the return box and giving it one more go, but even if they worked this time, I would be scared the motion detectors didn't warn me in a timely manner. You get what you pay for. Come out of pocket when it comes to cameras, or risk getting home invaded with zmodo.","[]","B017SD8SVO","B017SD8SVO","AEXHGERERNHZ6XWIJNPAZXPGGLIQ","2017-03-08 22:39:48.000","3","True","502"
"252413","2","Good Company Bad Motherboard","From my point-of-view as a programmer and technician, this is one of the worst motherboards I have seen. I tried using this motherboard with [[ASIN:B00DGGW3MI Amd FX-9590 8-core 4.7 GHz Socket AM3+ 220W Black Edition Desktop Processor FD9590FHHKWOF]], two sets of [[ASIN:B012DSZKV0 PNY Anarchy 16GB Kit (2x8GB) DDR3 1866MHz (PC3-14900) CL10 Desktop Memory MD16GK2D3186610AB]], and [[ASIN:B01FYDUCA0 EVGA 850 BQ, 80+ BRONZE 850W, Semi Modular Power Supply 110-BQ-0850-V1]].\\n\\nAccording to all specifications, this build should run, by default, at:\\n4.7GHz CPU speed\\n1866MHz RAM speed\\n32GB RAM amount\\n\\nInstead, it runs, by default, at:\\n5.0GHz CPU speed\\n1600MHz RAM speed\\n32GB RAM amount\\n\\nFor some reason, it automatically overclocks the CPU and underclocks the RAM. I tried every combination of settings I could find in the BIOS and online. I set the RAM multiplier to 9.33, CAS timings to the manufacturer specifications, and voltage to 1.6V to force it to 1866MHz, and it would still only go up to 1600MHz. It would also tell the operating system that the RAM was only running at 800MHz. I also could not get it to clock the CPU at 4.7GHz instead of being overclocked. Most setting combinations that changed the motherboard's values to what they should be resulted in booting errors. Nothing would work.\\n\\nThe socket and motherboard all state it is for AMD. The instructions and BIOS say it is for Intel. The instructions clearly state and show how to install an Intel processor. The BIOS only has performance memory profiles for Intel's XMP instead of AMD's AMP. From my experience, this is nothing more than an Intel motherboard with an AMD socket. I have used Gigabyte motherboards in the past without issue. It is just this motherboard version I have had issues with.","[]","B00ZYK7I8I","B01M70M9QT","AEZJDGGNM2IJT4RZ26BMGTTGJGBA","2017-02-28 02:15:23.000","3","True","502"
"187527","3","A Nice Case, Terribly Overpriced.","I had a Kindle Fire 7 that never had a case and it was fine. But now I was upgrading to a bigger size and thought the case might be nice. However, I'm not going to lie: I think the price is OUTRAGEOUS, especially when compared to the price of the Kindle Fire itself! I never would have paid full price for this. However, just before &#34;Prime Day&#34;, Amazon had a special &#34;Bundle&#34; deal, that offered the Kindle Fire HD 8, the Amazon case shown here, and a pair of screen protectors at a special price. I had been planning to get a totally different case, but this Bundle deal made it worthwhile to go with this option.\\n\\nI've read really mixed reviews about these cases, anywhere from it's &#34;the best thing ever&#34; to &#34;they fall apart at the seams&#34;. So far mine seems durable enough, although there are some pros and cons. Pros: It's super slim and doesn't add much bulk at all. It's also fairly classy, with the fabric pattern and general stye. I like that I can fold it entirely behind the Kindle or use it as a stand. I also like that closing the case puts the Kindle in sleep mode and opening it wake it up - no buttons needed.\\n\\nAs for cons: The &#34;stand&#34; feature ( in which you flip out a corner of the cover so it acts as a stand) isn't ideal. It technically works, but there are so many scenarios where you want it to stand it on a pillow, a couch arm, etc, and then you realize it's not ideal in all conditions. Sometimes it starts to slide flat and you have to catch it to keep it standing, it's just not perfected. Also, there are no cutouts for the speaker ports, so that's something to consider; the case must be open for full sound. Other than that I'm not sure there are any other cons - other than price! I still maintain that the price is insane. My bottom line is that as part of the Bundle deal, it was worth it. But I would never pay Amazon's asking price for this case, alone. Had it not been for the Bundle price, I would have chosen a different brand at half the price.","[]","B01N44JBS4","B01N44JBS4","AGYKFTNNEBG6POISSRXFP6OFWP3Q","2017-08-08 01:26:54.342","0","False","502"

It's better than ""basic"" but it's also not for 17"" laptops, either!","[[VIDEOID:9e9423bdb6d2ecae2e747fbcb53cff9a]] This is a solid backpack with lots of room and compartments.  The first compartment has several little dividers to hold your pens, post-it notes, business cards, phone, external drives, power cords, etc.  The second compartment is not as deep or wide as the other pockets but goes down the whole length of the backpack.  The third compartment is h-u-g-e!  It's deep and wide and about 3-4&#34; at the bottom and will hold a ton of books, folders, and notebooks.  The rear compartment has a padded area for the laptop, a shallow pocket and another huge area that's as big as the 3rd compartment.  Finally, in between the 3rd and 4th compartments is a mini-pocket that can hold a phone, iPod, ear buds, and other small items.  This thing can hold a lot!  On each side of the backpack is a mesh pocket with elastic top.  It will hold a 20 oz. bottle of water.  Drink containers larger than a 20 oz. water bottle will probably not fit.  Now, let's talk about padding.  The front compartment is padded, the handle is padded, the shoulder straps are very well padded and the areas that will be pressing against your shoulder blades and lower back are thickly padded, too.\\n\\nOverall, this is a great backpack and not too &#34;basic&#34;.  It's lightweight and strong.  However, I have a 17&#34; laptop (screen size).  When I actually measured the body, it is 16 1/2&#34;.  It can barely fit into the backpack without a lot of effort.  And at the very top of the bag, where the corners of the laptop are, the laptop is clearly pushing the limits of the fabric so now those areas of my laptop are at risk for damage if dropped and the bag probably won't last more than a year before those areas completely wear through.  And that is why I had to give this a 4-star rating.  :-(\\n\\nIf you have a 15&#34; laptop and a lot of gear to carry, then this backpack is great and would be worth all 5 stars!!!","[]","B00EEBS9O0","B01C7HZ47M","AHH5XC2UDDEAXP7TB6YQVIFLCZEQ","2017-03-27 19:13:49.000","671","True","502"
"450721","5","My experiences so that this is a reliable device that is easy to use. Set it up and forget it. It's always there for you!","I bought this item in March of 2014. I had just moved into a new (to me) home. My internet service provider had conveniently (!) place the modem at the far end of the home in the bedroom under my bed! The room that I was going to use as my office is at the opposite end of the house. I needed a booster. I am NOT a techie, especially when it comes to WiFi. I barely know a modem from a router. But, the description of the Securifi Almond made it sound easy to use. Since it can be used as either a router or a booster, I was concerned that I would have problems. But, once I got the hang of it, it was pretty easy. I did have to call their support once, but they answered quickly and walked me thru the process. Nice!\\n\\nToday, I got an email from the company that made my router. They told me that the firmware on the router is out of date and I need to download and install an upgraded firmware. Instead, I purchased the Google WiFi device. It was easy to set up. So, now that is on my night stand instead of the old router.\\n\\nEven though it is new, it still barely reaches my desk. So, I was hoping that my Securifi Almond would still work as a booster. I asked the Google support desk if they thought it would work. They said I should try but they didn't sound optimistic. So, I tried. I hadn't done anything with the device for over 3 years and I didn't have the manual. But, it was easy, because the instruction on the devices &#34;window&#34; led me through the steps. But, it failed. So, I started a Securifi support Chat from their website. It way past working hours, but a support agent came right online with me. We worked on it a few minutes. It didn't take long to discover that I had typed in the password wrong! And, with that corrected, I was able to connect to my Google WiFi. I really appreciate that they have a support desk that is open after working hours. They were friendly as well as helpful.\\n\\nSo, based on my experiences, this is a very reliable device. And, you can use it as either a router or signal booster. It's easy to set up!","[]","B0087NZ31S","B0087NZ31S","AGRRJ3YWYXVH4UCS5U3B7R36F3MQ","2017-07-22 01:39:47.451","2","True","502"
"492033","5","Great!","Honestly, this is a microphone I bought my 11 year old friend to use over Skype, Discord and Steam so he can play games with his friends.  They also play Mad Libs. Want to see a bunch of preteens laugh their heads off? I think they even have a website. My son was shocked that Mad Libs had been around since I was a kid! Ha!\\n\\nPrior to this he was using a cheesy little webcam but only for the microphone and if I invested time in one of the kids and realized they were in his age group (girls always get the bad reputation for being silly! Boys are far worse!) then they'd use their webcams little, but the computer is in the family room and I have to admit that having five middle school kids watching me watch tv etc was just weird. Plus, I know the sound quality was lacking by far.\\nMy son was so excited to see this mic, it looks like something a professional you tube gamer would use. His friends say he's easier to understand as well.\\nIt handles lots of loud screaming, it looks &#34;expensive&#34; and the cool little tripod it comes with means that it stays above the spills on the desk!\\nI'd like to say I've used this myself however he's taken control (although he denies it!) of our desktop!  We have a Mac mini it runs on quite well. We've had no connectivity issues, nothing to download or disc's to keep track of. Honestly, it's a sturdy little mic that has held up quite valiantly over summer.  I'm a little too indulgent and let my kids stay up late so this mic has been put through the paces.\\nI do know that his friends often hear myself or his little brother in the background and are always interested in the crazy things that my 6 year old will say. It doesn't pick up too much of the ambient house noises, such as the air conditioner.\\n\\nSo to wrap it all up; great price, puts up with crazy sounds and laughter including at a really high register.

"819848","5","Great so far!","Great so far, great picture and bright enough with a little ambient light to still watch, no rainbow effect and black levels seem good to me, but only used a couple times. will update when get more use. Hard to find much info on the ht1070 because newer, but if you look up benq w1090 it is the same thing. Think when it first came out that was the model number, not sure why it has changed. It was between this and the optoma 142x. Read some reviews and everyone recommends the benq over optoma, so i went with the benq ht1070 also because it is newer and the optoma is an older projector. both seem like great projectors, but the specs on paper for the optomas seem overated after seeing the tests done on them. This benq ht1070 is basically the same as the ht2050 just without the lens shift and a little less contrast ratio, and doesnt have the glass lens that the ht2050 has. It has great colors and great picture right out of the box and is plenty bright, so dont let the 2000 lumens fool you. The optoma is rated at 3000 lumens but thats because it has white in the color wheel so it is not a true lumen count. The ht1070 also has a 6x speed color wheel so it is very hard to see the rainbow effect compared to the optoma at 2x speed, Also another reason i chose this over the optoma. And i just didnt feel the h2050 was worth the big price jump for the lense shift, if you mount the projector screen centered with the projector you should not need lens shift and also with all the adjustment in the ceiling mounts that you can get there is no need.  Im throwing a 110&#34; screen from 11ft mounted on ceiling, and could also go bigger image from the same distance using the zoom, which is great! Everyone complains about the fan noise but i dont even notice it, i also have the sound running through my reciever so cant comment on the sound of the onboard speaker which ill never use. Glad i got this over the optoma because the optoma needs more space to throw the same size image. For the price of this and getting 1080p compared to a large plasma or led tv its a no brainer. Image quality is just as good as my 55&#34; plasma.","[]","B01LD12E1C","B01LD12E1C","AE5UAK6WDD32HID4ZO7YCSGQGUEA","2017-07-25 03:36:25.121","8","True","502"

Then, I got this one...\\n\\nIt's much better for larger hands, though not perfect.  The forward/back buttons near the thumb are perhaps a little too close to the wrist and might be better if they were juuuust a little further up the mouse's body.  It's definitely larger than the other, easier to grip, more room for all of your fingers... lots of improvements and good features for users with larger hands.\\n\\nMy only downfall so far is that even though it's much more comfortable than the smaller version, I don't think it's my favorite mouse... The quality seems decent, being able to adjust the dpi resolution and change your sensitivity is nice, and the materials feel good.  There's just something I like more about my trackball mouse, except that I've been through 2 of those already and I'm looking for something more durable.  Hopefully this is it.  The only other real adjustment to make is to remember that if you're back and forth to a keyboard all day, you need to pick your hand up or pull it back before you move over to the keyboard... I've knocked this thing over a couple of times and pushed it pretty far while getting my hand on or off of it without looking.  Just a weird muscle memory thing that is quickly overcome, but something to think about.\\n\\nOverall, I think it's a very good product and if you're looking for an alternative or something to change up your routine, I highly recommend this mouse, if not for anything else, just for the price.  It's VERY reasonable for what it provides - mainly something to challenge your standard, daily, repetitive mouse movements.  I find myself switching between this and my trackball mouse during the day, and haven't had the small amount of wrist pain that I had gotten used to in the past.","[]","B00BIFNTMC","B00BIFNTMC","AGMEXCQVVGT3CZHA3IJMBS6DNCZA","2017-01-20 19:39:02.000","0","False","502"
"196213","4","Better and cheaper than Bose over-the-ear for air travel","I have been using the Bose &#34;Quiet Comfort 25&#34; (over the ear headphones) for a while and wanted to try these in-ear headphones to further reduce the amount of stuff I need to bring with me when I travel. Given that the Audio-Technica are much smaller and much cheaper, I was ready for a downgrade but was pleasantly surprised. This review is mostly in comparison to the Bose Quiet Comfort 25 headphones.\\n\\nPros:\\n* While the Audio-Technica obviously don't feature the nice comfy over the ear cushion, I find that they are better suited for air travel if you happen to prefer to rest your head on one side when sleeping (rather than on the back). Small in-ear headphones allow that, large over-the-ear ones don't.\\n* Despite the much smaller size, I haven't found much difference in the noise cancelling feature. I'm not an audiophile and I'm sure a side-by-side comparison would find lots of differences, but as far as I'm concerned this is more than good enough.\\n* Long battery life time.\\n* Somehow the Bose headphones were sometimes a little uncomfortable for me when in noise cancelling mode as they were emitting some sounds with very high frequency and created some kind of uncomfortable pressure on the ear. That discomfort doesn't exist with the Audio-Technica earphones.\\n* The foam plugs work really well for me.\\n* Much cheaper and smaller.\\n\\nCons:\\n* It's probably a good idea to buy a hard case separately, even though a soft pouch is provided.\\n* The noise cancelling circuit is a little bulky and heavy (but asking for smaller/lighter would probably be unrealistic given the feature and the AAA battery) and does need to be placed on a surface or clipped to your clothing not to create downwards tension on the earphone cables.\\n* There is a small volume setting on the circuit, but a simple &#34;play/pause&#34; button would have been nice.\\n* A microphone would have been great for calls, but most laptops/phones/tablets have that, so not a big deal.\\n\\nUPDATE: Removing one star for the lack of a play/pause button anywhere, I find it more annoying that I thought.","[]","B004K09H32","B00WU0KVV6","AF6YGSANNC3EKOUPSBFD746SY7ZA","2017-02-22 00:11:49.000","8","True","502"

This led me to return the package, however this problem was most likely due to the fact that it was an Amazon warehouse deal and not bought brand new. Other than that problem, this computer is incredibly solid. My only vice is that the computer seems to be made out of plastic painted metallic rather than actual metal, and the track pack. The problems I have with this trackpad is one that I have with many, there are no physical buttons, rather just a flat slab where you press down anywhere to simulate a single press, rather than having 2 dedicated buttons and the actual trackpad.\\n\\nPros -\\n1.

"556717","3","Another huge disappointment was that mine had only one port for the ...","I purchased this almost a year ago after purchasing an older model for my daughter for Christmas.  I already knew from having hers available that the tablet was a fairly reliable one, so I felt safe getting the newer Octa-Core model for myself.  Unfortunately, paying extra for the Octa-Core processor did not really end up being worth the money because it is definitely not any faster than my daughter's quad-core, and in many cases, is probably much slower (depending upon what you're trying to do).  Overall, for the price and being a &#34;generic&#34; brand name, I was content with it.  Another huge disappointment was that mine had only one port for the charger/keyboard to plug into while my daughter's had 2.  She can charge her tablet AND use the internal keyboard at the same time, while I can not do both.\\nMy tablet has been great until it slid out of the case while walking into the entrance of a hotel, at which point the screen cracked and it's pretty demolished right now. I was under the impression that the cases were &#34;sturdy&#34; and would handle the weight of the tablet inside of them, especially considering that I placed it in there and haven't taken it out since then.  I was quite upset by this because the tablet was stacked neatly on top of a couple of other items (a clipboard, a sketch pad, and a pencil box), and was not dangling or being held at any angle that should have put any extra weight on the case, but as I opened the door, the slight lean to the side allowed the tablet to slide right out of the case, causing a crack in the corner that extends across the screen. :(  I would suggest maybe purchasing a separate case with a little more durability, since it apparently is possible for the tablet itself to slide out of the case provided.  On the other hand, though, after falling on concrete, and getting such a nasty looking &#34;scar&#34;, it still works as well as it did initially, other than areas that are harder for it to read your touch due to the scratches...\\nI will probably replace it with another one from Visual Land, though, because now that I know what to expect from them, and I would recommend this to a friend, under the warning that some features are sub-par.\\nThank you.","[]","B016S0XP3O","B016S0XP3O","AF6YNK3REWO7SUN3N3CM6V5NZWIA","2017-03-06 19:42:25.000","0","True","502"
"927172","4","Good camera for simple demands","I now have 3 of the 720P and 2 of the 1080P. All function the same except for the difference in resolution. The 1080 is good if you need detail up close and have it set to capture high resolution, otherwise, the 720 is fine and cheaper and takes less bandwidth. I started buying the 1080 a year ago and switched to 720's for the last 3 units because they are just fine. The software is difficult to follow due to poor documentation but if you visit the Amcrest YouTubes and forums you'll likely get answers to all your questions. I deducted 1/2 point for poor documentation. As others have noted and complained in the forums these tend to be plagued with remote viewing connection issues. I deducted another 1/2 point for the inconsistent connection reliability. On the upside there are many ways you can connect with instructions available via Amcrest. I like the DDNS, direct web address, P2P on smartphone and Amcrest View P2P on desktop. If I can't connect via one method I'll try others until I get through. But, from my experience avoid the Cloud option. Cloud settings override what you set on the camera. Nobody needs that headache. Instead, use a microSD and click on the Replay option of the software. One thing I did learn is that you can not put these in the window pointed outward and use the night vision. The IR lights beam off the window and white out the image. Similarly, expect the suns reflection to washout the window and cause severe reflection issues. A black camera may be better in those locations for less reflection. Heat buildup could be an issue although I had one in a west window in Arizona where temps reached around 105 right by the window some afternoons. That unit was baking in that location. Camera is still working. Alternatively, one could install an outdoor motion light and when it lights up the camera would record that event (plus the light turning off). Beats lots of false positives due to bugs and other floaty things in the night. Plus, what you capture would be in color not the black/white of IR. I like the PTZ capabilities and that you can preset the places to which it points. It gives me peace of mind to view the recorded events or PTZ live at remote sites and know nothing untoward has happened. Overall, I've been satisfied with my cameras - some in use over a year and others just a couple of months.","[]","B01FEDC0M8","B01FEDC0M8","AHJ2UKFGELHSSSDKKT4645KIJYWQ","2017-02-05 16:37:19.000","0","True","502"
"249980","4","Overall durable great bag with a couple annoyances.","I bought this bag directly through Tenba. This is a pretty good bag over all. It is extremely well-built strap and the D-rings are solid and will not break on you.  The bottom of the bag is also very durable. Plenty of space for all your stuff. the padded insert is awesome. The only reason it does not get 5 stars from is that the magnetic buckles suck. They are incredibly weak and do not stay latched on. After they fall off they will dangle and flap around making a lot  of noise. I ended up cutting mine off and am much happier. I would like to have a fastener that actually works yes but the velcro under the flap does a sufficient job. Tenba if you read this go back to regular buckles. Also, the small pocket on the flap is almost worthless. It's really small and you can barely get your hand in there. It should just be one big pocket. Overall I'm pretty happy with my purchase but those two cons are really annoying.\\n\\nEDIT: So I lied about the strap. Now the actual strap part is still working fine. It shows no sign of age HOWEVER the the swivel clip on the end of the D-ring connected to the strap has popped out of it's hole. I learned there is a tiny thin washer that fits into tiny slit in the side of the hard ware that fastens the clip inside the hole. Well that washer got worn out from swiveling so much and now will no longer hold true making the strap almost worthless. I had to have my coworker use a pneumatic wheel cutter to cut the D-rings off so I can use carabiners to hold the strap on making it no longer worthless. The metal the D-rings are made out of is no joke. The D-rings are seriously though. The fact that the swivel is held in with a thin washer is really disappointing and going by longevity is the first point of failure on my bag. I'm not going to remove any stars since the clips broke because I have had this bag for almost 4 years now with VERY heavy use in every sense of the term and it held up that long. No other messenger bag i've had has has used a strap this durable. The carabiner replacement is kinda annoying but it will be a decent fix. use locking carabiners if this happens to you.","[]","B00EVVNPT2","B07GLM6N1J","AF4KI5JAR5DKWDCT5NCQPQHUZWVA","2017-11-07 21:54:37.083","0","False","502"

I provide managed IT services to my customers and have for over 10 years in my own business.  There is a current trend for automation and security systems and I have recently done a ton of research on these items.  With extensive research on security cameras.  There are many many different manufacturers and systems out there so choose wisely.\\nReolink - I applied to be a dealer with Reolink as I found their pricing very very competitive and their products looked well built and feature rich, comparable to higher priced manufacturers.  I was contacted practically immediately by them and spoke with them over the phone.  And was set up.  But I digress a bit...even though I am a dealer at this time, I was not when I ordered this camera.  On to the review.\\nAs expected, this came within 2 days.  All items were in the box as stated.and expected, not going to get into the contents but item was well packaged and shipped fast.\\nInstructions were clear and setup was simple and to the point.  You will need to have a barcode scanner on you phone in order to establish a wifi connection but I didn't find that a big deal.  If you follow the instructions as written you should have no problems.\\nFirst I tested PTZ functions on network, meaning I was on my local network at my house.  All functions worked awesome.  Pan, tilt and zoom were all excellent.  I absolutely love the 2 way audio and video is fantastic.  The range is very good too.  I can say I set the unit approximately 75 feet from my router and the connection was still great.  I really have nothing negative to say about this.\\nExternally, meaning I was at WalMart and decided to test the functionality of the camera.  It literally worked as it did if I was standing inside my house.  No issues, no problems connecting.  This was not even on wifi, it was on my cell phones data.  Very impressed.\\nSo far I have not had to charge/change the batteries and I have had it running for about 2 weeks straight now.\\nIf there was anything I could say about it is it would be nice if it had wifi 5G connectivity but this is definitely not a deal breaker.","[]","B01N6SHRN9","B01N6SHRN9","AFMFYLACJ7FJ3AGTLXT5Z7STD3HA","2017-03-17 02:35:30.000","17","True","502"
"537943","5","Not an extraneous purchase, a great addition to the TV experience b/c very easy to use and great media selection","I cannot recommend the Roku enough!\\n\\nInitially, I did a lot of research on the topic of streaming sticks and Roku seemed like the winner between the competitors (i.e. Apple, Google, and Amazon).\\n\\nAfter using Roku for about a year, here are the benefits/ things that I like best about it:\\n(1) The interface is extremely user-friendly.\\n(2) Plug-in and go. Otherwise, nothing has to be installed, and you can simply plug into whatever tv has an HDMI port.\\n(3) There are 100's to 1,000s of channels available. There are many free and paid content channels. A lot of the major media companies have media channels on Roku (i.e. NBC, Fox, ABC) BUT there are a few companies either lack a channel or require a paid subscription (i.e. CBS[paid all access account] or time warner companies [ex: cartoon network not available]). Personally, I logged into my cable provider and can view all of the current season's episodes for the major media companies that have channels. If you do not have a cable provider, those channels typically make available the newest episodes aired for major shows.\\n(4) The remote is very responsive. The remote has no lag and the Roku device is always very responsive to it.\\n(5) There is no major lag when the Roku goes to sleep and you wake it up.\\n(6) It is very easy to sign and sync into paid accounts like Amazon video or Google video or Netflix or HBO.\\n(7) The ads aren't that annoying. Yes, I know what you're thinking, ads are incredibly annoying and there are plenty of other sources to watch TV where you can avoid them like no other. Typically, there are about 3-5 ads per commercial break and they tend to repeat. But that's it. You do not feel as bombarded as you may do when you watch regular TV.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I think that the Roku really great addition to the TV watching experience! At first, I thought it was just a luxury purchase. However, I found how much easier it is to watch TV on demand rather than waiting for the networks to dictate my schedule. Plus, sometimes it is nice to watch TV on an actual TV rather than on a computer or phone.","[]","B01DA0YCNC","B01DA0YCNC","AH45BL2GQHAWRF6BCXGEW2723KOA","2017-04-26 00:05:49.000","0","True","502"

"215907","2","You get what you pay for","Good news: it fits my camera (Nikon D3400 18-55mm lens) as expected. Bad news: the quality isn't that great. The wide angle lens leaves a pretty decent fishbowl effect, and cropping that out would pretty much give me what my regular lens could give me.

If the order is correct, then the first photo is with the wide angle, used on my 18-55 lens, at 18mm (no zoom). You can see that there is a pretty nasty fishbowl effect, which leaves various features of the space curved, distorted fun-house-mirror-like. You can especially see it near the crown molding, the light fixture chain, and the refrigerator. Yikes. The second picture is the same shot, but without this product (just the usual 18-55mm lens, at 18mm. If I were to crop out the fishbowl effect of the first, I'd be left with the same amount of space in the photo as I would've had with a regular lens, and at least then I wouldn't still have to worry about distortions.\\n\\nThe third picture is with just the macro lens attached (no wide angle) on my 18-55mm lens at 18mm. I did not zoom or crop this image. You can see that I'm not SUPER close to the item, and there's a little bit of a vignette effect around the outer corners. The fourth image (second ring shot) is the same as the first ring shot, but with the wide angle attachment as well. Major effects around the edges. The last image (third ring shot) was taken using a different product- my zoom tube extension. This was also taken at 18mm (no zoom) and was not cropped. You can see how much closer I get to the rings, and that there is no weird distortions around the edges.\\n\\nAll this being said, I will be returning this item.

I told def tech about this and they immediately sent two new speakers.\\n----\\nThey sound good &#34;enough&#34; (NOT as good as the A/D/S indoor speakers they replaced after lugging the A/D/S  speakers in and out over the last year). They DO require equalization.\\n  THE BUILT-IN WOOFER AND PASSIVE DRIVER DOES NOT ALLEVIATE THE NEED FOR A SUBWOOFER (although you will survive without one if necessary). Any reviews saying you don't need a subwoofer were by ppl who never owned a subwoofer.\\n  Also, they are pretty directional. So if you sit slightly off center, most of the sound will seem to come from the ONE speaker you are a little closer to. If you are away from the field of the speakers entirely, the highs will quickly drop off.\\n  The sound quality improves when you add a subwoofer with a crossover at about 100, limiting the amount of audio/bass the def techs have to handle. I use a Polk subwoofer with my own add-on casters and i just roll it out of the deck cabinet when needed. All connections have two-pole quick connectors (defaulted to &#34;no sub&#34;), so i can reconfigure with or without the OPTIONAL sub instantly. It all takes seconds.\\n  Also note: Although the speaker terminals take banana plugs, there is not enough clearance between the speaker cabinet and the mount to use straight plugs. I had to buy L-Shaped banana plugs and &#34;trash&#34; the straight ones.\\n  One more thing: I DO NOT like the fact that you CANNOT use these speakers WITHOUT the mounting brackets and you CANNOT stand them VERTICALLY due to the large and obtrusive bracket mounting areas on both ends. Some ppl (me, for example) DO NOT wish to mount these to the building.\\n  I have Def Tech SM55's in the living room (no sub needed), and SM65's in the theater and they're great (but also need equalization), but DEFINITIVE TECH really, really needs to rethink these outdoor speakers.","[]","B00170HCOO","B001BBT7RY","AEYULVEQG2EIOD2WTOP3Z7P4FTIQ","2017-06-14 21:18:50.663","11","True","502"

Let me tell you, finding a case that I liked and that fit my new computer was not easy. The first one I ordered was way too big and left my laptop sliding back and forth in the bag, others looked cheap (for a comparable price to this). I didn't want to spend $50+ on a nice bag, it wasn't in my budget.\\n\\nThis bag is the perfect size to hold my laptop. It fits in securely with the Velcro strap and doesn't have too much extra space. It's a snug fit. There are plenty of pockets to suffice for my freelance needs. Room for folders, pens &amp; pencils, charging cord, flash drives, external hard drive, and my mouse - all with room to spare! There's even a handy pocket on the outside to hold my phone.\\n\\nNow on to the padding. At first I was concerned with the padding in the bag, would it be enough? The pictures of the bag make it look like its very slender and that it wouldn't provide much protection. The bag isn't super thick, but laptops have changed from what they once were. We no longer need wide cases for laptops that are more and more slender. The padding is perfect. I pressed it between my thumb and index finger and it is very solid - no complaints here!\\n\\nI am generally very careful with my electronics, but accidents do happen. I believe this case will protect my laptop if that does happen.\\n\\nOverall, I'm very happy with my purchase. Great product at a great price!\\n\\nEDIT:\\nThe ring on the bag that the shoulder strap clips onto fell off this weekend. Thankfully my laptop was not in the bag when this happened. Unfortunately I have to knock some stars off this review. The padding of the bag itself I am still confident in, but the ring that is attached to the bag needs to be attached better, it just fell right off when I was moving the bag! I'm glad my dad is like MacGyver and was able to fix it for me.\\n\\nAnyone who buys this case, I suggest you take a pair of pliers and squeeze the rings that hold the strap on to make sure they are as tight as possible.","[]","B01F4F70GW","B01F4F70GW","AG3O6OZBDKIWZGSMHCGF2ZR54WIQ","2017-01-13 14:26:47.000","8","True","502"
"895777","2","NIce camera - but audio (movies)?","Nice camera - for photographs - only.  Movies are also good, if you prefer essentially silent movies  or with extraneous sounds.  The microphone is in a 1/32 inch hole to the left of the on/off button.  The audio suffers due to the location.  Sound from all around will be recorded as well as the scene being photographed.  The speaker is also on on top, to the right of the on/off button.  When playing a movie, as recorded on the camera, a volume control flashes on the first few seconds then disappears.  I have mine set to the maximum and, well, I do hear enough to recognize the movie.  See included photograph.\\n\\nI suppose you may assume I am disappointed with the sound portion of this camera.  It is MP4, but due to its location, the recorded sound suffers from recording sound from all directions.  I wish it had provisions for an external microphone, and it would be nice to have significant audio output for editing.  When played over my audio system it is good.  But I have to be careful of extraneous sounds when making the movie.\\n\\n I inquired Cannon's support regarding the sound capabilities.  It is as I have described.  I give it a 2-star, and sometimes I think that is generous, given my years of experience with Canon's cameras.  The Canon Powershot SD 980 was better with the audio, - far better.  BTW - I find Canon’s Customer support to be excellent, as usual.\\n\\nIf you use a Macintosh, you will need a micro USB connector to transfer photographs.  The application “Image Capture” works as usual with the USB connection.  Wi-Fi needs the most recent OS, and even with that it seems iffy.  Hence, USB.  With the older OS, 10.7, using USB was fine, using  the micro USB used by the Android phones.  But nothing via Wi-Fi.  I am disappointed; I expected more.  However, I should have noted that the self-proclaimed leading consumer magazine never mentioned audio in its reports.  Audio was absolutely ignored.  In my mind, if the camera supports movies and sounds, that should be included.  An obvious error that I ignored.  I did not purchase this through Amazon because of a special offer via another vendor.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71px8V26o4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71px8V26o4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71px8V26o4L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01FFACR50","B01FGSV2HK","AGTP2TKW2A6QKHCJOZ6MTGKAMM4Q","2017-04-11 15:04:24.000","14","False","502"
"657624","4","Awesome Semi-rigid case providing suppor/protection for carrying the laptop with other items in a backpack.","I was concerned about this case not fitting the 12&#34; Macbook well (I own the 2017 version) due to comments stating things like there being a little room left over in the case and seeing youtube videos in foreign languages with poor views/angles of a Macbook 12&#34; in the case. Well, it's a near perfect fit and there's just enough room to wedge your fingers in to pull out the laptop.\\n\\nI went with the Book Viper Hardcase 12 because there were very limited options on semi-rigid cases for my 12&#34; Macbook. I wanted a semi-rigid over a sleeve because I cary my laptop in a backpack with books, etc and need the extra protection/support for the laptop. I noticed my late 2016 15&#34; MBP I gave up for my 12&#34; Macbook would have oily impressions on the screen from the keyboard... even with me being carful about placing the computer in my backpack on the outside compartment and keeping pressure off it.\\n\\nI also recommend screen protectors for the 12&#34; MacBook (MR Shield) due to the anti-glare coating scratching on MacBooks very easily.\\n\\nMy only other option for a semi rigid case was the Thule Gauntlet 3.0 MacBook Air Envelope which doesn't completely surround the laptop allowing for dirt/debris to get into the case as well as the closure being made of velcro. The Book Viper Hardcase definitely looks like it'll hold up well and some over the next few years. Definitely worth the costs. I paid full price at $44.95 (no sales/deals).\\n\\nAlso worth noting is that I tried an Incase zip up sleeve from the Apple Store. I didn't care for the wedge design of the laptop pushing through the zipper edge side and making contact with the metal chassis of the computer. This case is soft on all side and should protect the MacBook without damaging it.\\n\\nMy only qualm with this case so far is the thin interior padding on the laptop side... just seems like cheap foam that may breakdown quickly (hence my four out of five stars)... time will tell.\\n\\nI'll followup with this review if any of my initial impressions/experiences change. I hope you found this brief review helpful :-)","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PKVxJDXHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PKVxJDXHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PKVxJDXHL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZryL3ieFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZryL3ieFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZryL3ieFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B0117YH93I","B0117YH93I","AHQR3EFHYLYEUHCTAP7YRWAOD3CA","2017-06-12 23:33:13.974","1","True","502"

Its so easy, they have all the pieces, but it feels like they are lacking a designer that could inject some real-world usability into this product.\\n\\nI've previously reviewed the ICFC717PJ Sony alarm clock, and almost all the same faults persist, plus one or two new faults.\\n\\n-All the buttons are still very loud, so setting up a new alarm next to a light sleeper will probably wake him up.\\n-The &#34;alarm off&#34; button is still indistinguishable from the others, requiring me to stick a raised bump next to it (those little kitchen bumps that protect drawers from slamming) so I can find it in the dark or when I'm groggy. See photo for where I put my bump.\\n-The setup has gotten slightly harder because now the button that switches you to the &#34;next&#34; setting (hour-&#62;minute-&#62;am/pm-&#62;etc) is now the unintuitive snooze button rather than the alarm A or alarm B buttons.\\n-While it's not big, it feels like the cube is larger than it needs to be.\\n-This model does not have a thermometer, I really liked this feature in the ICFC717PJ, it's very disappointing because that was useful to know.\\n\\n-And OMFG the alarm clock makes a LOUD BEEP AFTER SETTING THE ALARM! Who the hell thought, hey, let me set off a big loud beep to fully awake your spouse after you already have him half awake from the other button clicks?

"89944","4","Great product which functions as advertised","Great product which functions as advertised, however, it could benefit from improvements to the accompanying phone application.\\n\\nSetup was relatively easy, and I used it with the iPhone.  They\\nFirst the good.  These devices do save you some time and worry.  They have come in quite handy finding my car keys and wallet that I’ve misplaced around the house.  I recently took a trip and dropped a pixel in my checked luggage at check-in.  It worked like a charm when I got on the airplane I was able to see that my luggage was in range.  Yes, the signal was weak, but as we taxied out, I knew my bag had made it on board.  So as far as locating your items TrakR Pixel hits the mark.\\n\\nThere are functional issues that need improvement.  First, when I initially set up the Pixel, I was not aware that the app must be running on your phone all the time to be able to track your devices.  Not a terrible problem if you are trying to locate your Pixel attached to your keys.  Simply turn on the app and your pixel will start to sing and flash. However, if you would like to use your keys to ring your phone, your app must be running.  Unfortunately, leaving the app on drains battery life of your phone and turning the app off defeats the purpose of crowd-locating. Second, I find the separation alerts unusable.  Ideally what should occur is that if your phone moves out of range of the Pixel signal the phone will alert you by ringing or if in silent mode vibrating.  However, what has been occurring is that the signal between the Pixel and the phone frequently drops and you are alerted by the ring or the vibration. This happens when the devices are right next to each other, as in the same pocket or sitting on top of one another on the desk.  Like the boy who cries wolf, these frequent nuisance interruptions make this feature unreliable, which has to lead me to disarm the separation alerts.  Finally, I wish the battery life was a bit longer.  I’ve had the Pixels for four months, and I’m moving on to my third set of batteries.\\n\\nOverall, improvements in the functionality of the App and the battery life of the Pixels would greatly enhance the value of this already great and useful product.","[]","B073HSNZDJ","B075QC3TZY","AHKLQD5EZ4ADVDK2ZPP7FXJFESWA","2017-12-01 19:44:00.257","7","False","502"

"59744","5","Good-looking, hard-working, chock-full of features.","This is just a fabulous tablet. I had been using a Wacom Bamboo provided by my school before investing in this tablet for myself, so I can't say precisely how this compares to a similarly-sized tablet from Wacom (such as the Intuos), but I can say that this tablet is worth every penny. The construction is very solid, and the active area has a pleasant texture to write on. There are two small green lights hidden under the logo that light up when the pen is hovering within range, when writing on the surface, or when clicking a hotkey.\\n\\nI did run into some driver glitches at first, since the latest version for Windows (13.14.13) does NOT work for this tablet. You have to download version 12.3.7 for this model. To access the advanced settings to configure the active area and hotkeys and to change into left-handed mode, you have to run the driver program as an administrator. Once I got the driver running, the pen sensitivity was acute and the hotkeys were responsive.\\n\\nBesides the rough start with the driver, this tablet works wonderfully. The pen has a auto-sleep feature to conserve battery, but charging it for an hour has led to at least five hours of use and it is still going strong. The hotkeys do have a little bit of horizontal wiggle, but they are very secure in the vertical direction. The connecting cable has a right angled bend so the cord runs parallel to the edge of the tablet. This feature is quite nice for right-handed users, but kind of backfires for left-handed users like myself. The softkeys are printed onto the tablet surface, so when in left-handed mode, they get moved to the bottom edge. This is a little annoying, since there does not seem to be a way to move the clickable region to the top edge. My final quibble with this tablet is that it can't be used like a touchpad, since the active region maps to absolute location on the monitor. The area is so large that this isn't really a big deal, though.\\n\\nThe included accessories, especially the extra nibs, are a nice touch. Overall, I highly recommend this tablet. For $80, I don't think a better product exists. For most graphic design and digital drawing work, this tablet is more than capable of meeting your needs.","[]","B01HT70QGY","B01HT70QGY","AH3IESNY77TQEADWFUTQ6J5FCNKA","2017-07-25 06:29:50.294","13","True","502"
"503016","2","Alexa Shouldn't Quit her Dayjob","A cool little device, in theory. And essentially free since it came with $20 in Amazon credit, so it was worth the experiment.\\n\\nI like the idea of just scanning barcodes when I find myself about to run out of something and having it arrive soon after. Basically, you scan something, and the item gets added to your cart (so you have a chance to check it before committing).\\n\\nThe devil is in the details. I scanned my dwindling dishwasher detergent. Instead of adding a bottle to my cart, a pack of six bottles was added, for a cost of $75. I scanned an empty box of Zip-Loc bags. My cart picked up a three-pack for $20. There was no way to fix these. They aren't sold by Amazon in normal amounts.\\n\\nThis just isn't how I shop. I want *one* bottle of detergent and *one* box of plastic bags. I don't need to stock enough for the end of the world. Obviously, it varies. Some products are available in singles. But the point is that the Dash Wand may be of limited use depending on your purchasing habits. I can't rely on it. The best I can do is scan things and hope for the best, which actually makes my life more complicated and not less. I'm stuck picking through a confused shopping cart afterwards, deleting items and fixing others.\\n\\nIts other functions are neat... again, in theory. It's convenient to grab off the 'fridge and ask how to convert recipe measurements, or what the safe temperature is for cooking chicken (although I had to ask the &#34;right&#34; way to get that second one to work). It falters for other tasks, though. It would be cool if I could ask for, say, a basic cocktail recipe. But at best you'll get diverted to Allrecipes, and at worst you'll get a bunch of random items appearing in your shopping cart that you need to clear later.\\n\\nThe Dash Wand is a cool idea, and the problems stem more from what's going on behind the scenes than from the device itself. And that makes me partly optimistic that Amazon might be able to fix its shortcomings in the long run. But until then it's a high-tech 'fridge magnet, just barely good enough to be free.","[]","B01MQMJFDK","B01MQMJFDK","AEKZN6X3JDIVSLSWL3JPLKSMNCYQ","2017-06-26 23:35:26.806","2","True","502"

It is the best iMac stand I have been able to find, but that's not really saying a whole lot.\\n\\nFunctionally, it works well. It holds the iMac securely, with a number of adjustable heights. The metal is a close enough match to the iMac that it doesn't look completely out of place. And I imagine the ability to store stuff in the stand is nice, but that's not a feature I use.\\n\\nOn the down side, I found the build quality to be far below what you'd get from an Apple product, and therefore it's kind of a glaring contrast up against the iMac. There are some rough edges on the metal, it's hard to get the gaps around the front panel to be even, and there's a chip or imperfection in the metal finish on the top of mine. It looks a little bit &#34;cheap&#34; in comparison to the iMac. The interior shelf also doesn't really fit in as securely as I'd expected (it's secure when the Mac is in place, so it's not a huge issue, but it contributes to the cheap feeling). I also wish it were a bit easier to adjust the height — having to lift the computer out, remove the shelf, slide it into another slot, and then put the computer back is kind of a hassle. I'm not sure what a better system would be here, but it's definitely been annoying as I've been experimenting and trying to find the ideal height. Once I get it all dialed in, I probably won't touch it again and this will become a non-issue, but I did want to mention it.\\n\\nMore subjectively, I find the aesthetic to be a little bit too industrial. It is very reminiscent of the &#34;cheese grater&#34; Mac Pro, which you will note is no longer being manufactured. Apple has moved on to a cleaner look, and that makes this product feel kind of outdated in that regard.\\n\\nOverall, the job gets done, but I'm not thrilled with the quality for the price, and I will be continuing my hunt for a stand that would truly look at home on my desk under my iMac.","[]","B009HPGD2I","B009HPGD2I","AHVQN7PVWPRJV5F5XLFOCIYMDSGA","2017-08-22 03:06:26.439","4","True","502"

It's main purpose was to use for typing up my writing notes, digital art, and some leisure activities. I decided to wait until I have owned this computer for a year+ to write a review for those of you looking for longevity in your computers. I really, REALLY wish there were more reviews that wait this long to review a product, especially this one. I wouldn't have bought it if there were.\\n\\nSo first off, this laptop is aestetically nice, however, it is HUGE. This isn't a laptop you wanna use for commuting. That isn't my use for it so that's not what brings it down to the one star.\\n\\nThe one star is because of how much it freezes up. I've had to reset this computer as many as 4 times in the course of a half an hour because it freezes up so much. The screen will go fuzzy for a millisecond then complete freeze. No ctrl+alt+del, no nothing. And when does it like to freeze up? That's right, WHILE I'M TYPING. I can't type consistently for very long before I get the deep freeze (and no, it's not one of those &#34;leave it for 5 minutes and it goes back to normal&#34; issues that people were having with Windows 10, it stays frozen), and even worse, if I'm listening to music or watching a video on Youtube, theres this AWFUL high pitched screech that comes with the freezing. There is NO fix for this.\\n\\nAnd it's not like I'm running 50 programs at once. AT MOST, I'm running Itunes and a writing suite or GIMP. This should be COMPLETELY within the capabilities of a 8 GB ram laptop.\\n\\nThe only thing I can do on this computer for hours without worrying about a freeze is gaming. Which is the LAST purpose I had intended it for.\\n\\nSo I have a big pretty silver turd, that since December 2015, I have barely been able to use. I'll be buying a new laptop next month, definitely not a Dell, and this will collect dust until I find someone I hate enough to give this to. I couldn't even bring myself to ask for money for this from my worst enemy, thats how awful this computer is.","[]","B010DOD2G6","B01ACKL7LI","AF7ZDIMTKIFNW4C2IE3ZAEOX7ZWA","2017-03-21 17:34:48.000","5","True","502"

Currently dealing with a rampant problem where some cameras won't update their firmware.\\n\\n1. The settings don't stay set. By far the most annoying aspect, is that this system constantly 'forgets' what settings you configured. I have 3 cameras, and they are supposed to do a recording each time they detect motion. But for some reason, they will randomly change to do nothing; when they detect anything, and I won't get any recordings unless I set them again. I recently had something stolen from my front porch, and we don't know who did it because the camera failed to remember it was supposed to record.\\n\\nUPDATE: The Arlo support team is suggesting that the fix to this may be to set the cameras to a different mode; For me, that means changing it away from Samsung Smartthings mode; so if you use Smartthings you might want to avoid this.\\n\\n2. Arlo support is terrible. Once you finally figure out how to make a support ticket, they just give you canned answers about how to set up the cameras. It is taking me a lot of interactions just to get them to understand the problem I am having, which I described in #1\\n\\n3. Accessories are also a let-down. Don't bother trying to use the magnetic camera mounts - your camera won't stay in place, it will slide down. Don't bother using the 3rd party battery charger - I pull my battery out of the charger and its only at 31% charge for some reason.\\n\\n4. These prices aren't competitive. Considering you have to do so much extra work just to make this system work, you might as well spend the money on a real security system, or at least a better DIY technology. I am only hoping that I'll be able to sell someone all this equipment, so I can try something like Nest or SimpliSafe.\\n\\n5. The app is not that good. You can't really share access to the cameras, so my wife cannot use the cameras as much as me since its my user account.","[]","B01LWS96JV","B01LWS96JV","AEDCLBKJKYYF5XLD5APL3IQRV3BQ","2017-09-29 00:23:08.682","2","True","502"

You will need bigger speakers!\\n\\nIt has handful of sound effect options like Hallway, Concert, ect.  By far, the best feature is the speaker setup which allows you do tweak each speaker to get it just right.  You can set distance and gain for each speaker.  The interface is very basic text only.\\n\\nWhoever designed the speaker screw knobs should be shot!  Why in the world would you put the holes at an angle so that it's hard as hell to see or get the wire in there?  They should have been top holes for the top jacks and bottom holes for the bottom jacks.  Nope, instead they are are all at 45 degree angle so the neighbor knob is in the way.  Arrrgh.  Stupidity.\\n\\n4 different video inputs is nice.  That's more than enough for most people.  I have not used 4K to confirm the 4K claim.  I wish they offered a second output but oh well.\\n\\nThe radio AM/FM reception is quite bad even with the provided antennas.  Unless you have an antenna on your roof and can connect this to it, don't expect much luck with reception.  I'm 10 miles from the city but even my cheap radios have better reception than this.\\n\\nBuild quality is pretty standard.  Metal construction with plastic speaker jack knobs.  Vents are at the top.  I don't like that.  I prefer side vents.\\n\\nThe remote is pretty robust with buttons.  It works well even at a far distance.  The battery door?.......  It's just begging to fall off.  Cheapest thinnest plastic ever!","[]","B00J30GXW2","B01MQHCN8R","AGM7ZF43SBSCFCXQPLAEUYHYT4KA","2017-04-03 22:03:18.000","7","True","502"
"306230","1","One bud stopped working 3 months in :-/ Bummed.","UPDATE: Upon seeing this poor review, Jaybird customer service contacted me and attempted to remedy the situation by upholding their company policy on replacements. If I had multiple pairs of working earbuds, this might be okay, but I don't. At $100 a pop, I don't have a back-up pair here. Their policy is to only mail a replacement upon receipt of either the broken pair or a photo of your earbuds physically cut apart (so they cannot work anymore). While I can certainly understand why they might have such a policy, it's very unfriendly and also impersonal. I expressed my issue with doing this to their customer service rep multiple times to no avail. I have massive problems sleeping, and the single earbud on my pair that does work, well, it's what I can use to listen to something to fall asleep at night. So, if I cut the cord and am waiting several days for new ones, well, that's several days without the guarantee I'll fall asleep okay. Look, I realize this all sound waah waah and personal... but it's my situation. It would have been pretty cool for the company to have a heart for a moment and send the buds and trust that I'd send back a photo of both the new, working pair and my cut up half-broken pair. But nope.\\n\\nWell, policies are policies, and in this case, people aren't of much concern to this company. Shame, since a lot of folks were asking me what buds I'm wearing and also if I recommended them... which I can say now that I do not.\\n\\n----\\nAbout 3 months into owning these, the right earbud just flat out stopped working. It seems to be a wiring issue since if I try really hard and mess with it, sometimes it spots back on for a second, but it doesn't stay back on. Super disappointing for $100 earbuds. I'm sure I can deal with the warranty on them, but, again for $100 they shouldn't just half die 3 months in with normal use - and the time it'll take me to deal with a warranty claim is a major PITA. I'm super annoyed because I want these to work now that I finally figured out how to get them to feel comfortable in my ears, I don't want to get another brand, but I'm torn :-/","[]","B01EHIQB1C","B01H6TM5B4","AGEZLAPEV5WSFAKDY7JLUYMCV7JQ","2017-07-11 15:05:02.508","1","True","502"

That's when I noticed that it would not record after 3-4 minutes. It would reset when the car was turned on but the same results.  So all I had was a bunch of 3-4 minute video clips of the start of every drive.\\nSo I decided to check my car's camera, a 1.5 year old rexing.  Oddly enough the same issue more or less.  But in this case it would turn off after 3-5 loop recordings (no pattern) and with sound intermittently cutting out within the loop recording.\\nSo If you are relying on video all the time, you'd better check it occasionally because both of mine did not perform as first installed and as needed.\\nAt the time, I had purchased and installed the micro sd cards they recommended, the sandisk Ultra.  Bought two of them.  Also they recommend that you format the card monthly to avoid possible problems.\\nSo reading the FAQ section they also recommend updating the firmware.  Not exactly an easy task.  Well one passed but the newer one froze up.\\nSo now for the positive side, after calling the company technical help desk, and explaining the issue, she said, after verifying my amazon purchase, that a new one would be sent out right away and a pre addressed envelope would also be sent out to sent the bad one back.  Great service for sure.  I was expecting more of a run around.  But it was very pleasant.\\nWhat I learned, first update the firmware, especially while still under warranty, next format the sd card every month, that's what she advised.  What a pain and finally they changed what card they recommend.  Now they recommend the high endurance version.\\nBut its disapointing that I cannot rely on such a nice dash camera with great video and that I had to upgrade the cards from what they first recommended only a year ago.\\nI highly recommend that you routinely check its operation so that you can be somewhat confident that it will be there when you really need it.\\nI'm still worried that I can't rely on it.  It will take time to build trust if it operates like it was designed to.

I am out 65 bucks and a few more nights without home security cams. First of all I swear they were marked PRIME and I didn't get these for about 5 business days. I got them and was very excited. I sat down this morning with a cup of coffee my phone and laptop thinking the hardest part of these would be me screwing the cameras into my vinyl siding. I wish.. I plugged em up, attached the mounting pieces and antennas. I downloaded and created accounts on not just the &#34;Zmodo&#34; app but the &#34;Me share&#34; app as well. It wanted me to connect to a special network and then connect to my wifi. I was able to do this once. It would only detect one of my cameras. So I uninstalled the apps and retried the connection, this time and every remaining time I tried it would not give me the option to connect to the zmodo network. So with my one camera, I explored the picture and tried to see how fast the motion detector would alert me. This is where I got pissed. I searched for 3 hours online through forums and youtube and even called zmodo. No one could help me activate the motion detection device. I could only view live video. Then after I gave up at 4:55 PM, I got an alert from the &#34;me share&#34; app saying motion was detected ... get this.... at 4:06 PM. WOW! Good thing I wasn't laying in bed and a murderer decided to ascend the steps into my home. I would have been dead by the time the damn app let me know motion was detected. It's just not for me. I don't have 2 weeks to dedicate teaching myself about the installation and application specifics of a freaking camera. There are far too many other options out there and I honestly don't even feel safe with them. I considered hauling them out of the return box and giving it one more go, but even if they worked this time, I would be scared the motion detectors didn't warn me in a timely manner.

The device paired successfully with my iPhone and my two daughters' iPads, and the interface is really nice (the top &#34;lid&#34; looking part turns on/off and acts as volume control, has a nice feel to it).  Unfortunately, the device absolutely will NOT connect to any device other than the one it most recently paired with.  The ONLY way a second person can use the speaker is if the first person to use it literally UNPAIRS with the speaker (i.e. has their iPad or iPhone &#34;forget&#34; the Bluetooth connection altogether).\\n\\nI called Philips to see if there was something I was doing wrong, because we even tried turning off the speaker, turning off the iPad it was connected to, turning back on the speaker, and then going into the iPhone Bluetooth settings and manually tapping on the Philips device to &#34;connect&#34; with it.  iOS always responded &#34;unable to connect.&#34;  The Philips speaker blinks its blue light for all of eternity in search of the original Bluetooth device's signal, even if you took a sledgehammer to the original device and threw it out the window 20,000 years ago.  The phone representative verified the only way multiple devices can use the speaker is to constantly pair and unpair with it, and he said that even he admittedly was surprised when he first learned about this blatant failure of common sense engineering.\\n\\nI have a hands-free Bluetooth device that was installed in my car many years ago, and even way back then, this limitation was not present.  To this day I can get into the car, and when the Bluetooth device finally figures out that my wife's phone is not present, it connects with my phone.  That's how Bluetooth should work.\\n\\nDefinitely returning this speaker.\\n\\nUpdate on 3/15/17:  Since no Bluetooth speaker manufacturers ever seem to specify details of how their speakers work with multiple paired devices, I thought I'd mention that I purchased the Urpower II Waterproof IPX7 Bluetooth speaker, and it works well with multiple devices without &#34;forgetting&#34; any paired connections.

"640328","5","Great Customer Service, But Not For 3+ Monitors","Original review (1 star):\\nDOA. Save yourself some time and buy a cable from someone else.\\n\\nUpdated review:\\nAfter looking into it some more, I found that the most probably reason the cable didn't work was not that it was malfunctioning, but because it is not an &#34;active&#34; DisplayPort adapter (it is &#34;passive&#34;).  A passive adapter is simply a cable that goes form DisplayPort and to DVI.  Your computer will detect that the signal required is DVI and output it.  An active adapter has extra circuits on it that &#34;trick&#34; your computer.  Your computer will think that the signal required really is DisplayPort, and it will output DisplayPort.  The adapter will then use its circuits to convert into DVI.  The reason this matters is because most computers can only support a certain amount of DVI/HDMI/VGA connections (I believe usually only 2).  Therefore, you need the computer to not output another DVI for a third monitor; you need it to output DisplayPort (which is why you need an active adapter for 3+ monitors).  However, for just one (or maybe two) monitors, a passive adapter would work just fine.  Since I needed a cable for a 3rd monitor, I ended up going with Cable Matters Gold Plated DisplayPort to DVI Cable, 6 Feet.\\n\\nSo, now on to why they have great customer service.  Obviously before I wrote that the cable was DOA and left a bad rating.  I also returned the package (for a refund).  Something I was not expecting was that the seller (BenfeiDirect) sent me a personalized email apologizing and shipped me a replacement (for free).  I was very impressed by this (hence the 5 stars).  This also led me to look into the cable a little more to see if it was actually DOA.  As it turns out, it probably wasn't.  I just didn't know about active and passive adapters.\\n\\nMy only request to Benfei would be to put somewhere on the page that the adapter is a passive adapter.  Other than that, nice job Benfei!  If I ever need more cables, I will try to buy from you!","[]","B01GPMRXL0","B0BSTN9SNQ","AEWS2JMDOBRP6FDUN54QMY7GYH2A","2017-04-02 00:56:22.000","1","True","502"

They did not.\\n\\nI then filed a case with LG, but then due to unforeseen serious medical issues couldn't follow up immediately.\\n\\nI finally did follow up, and a tech came to my house.

Previously I've built half a dozen webcams using Raspberry Pi, and three using the more powerful Orange Pi PC.  I've noticed the more expensive Orange Pi PC board runs with very low CPU utilization and little RAM used in my webcam application, this made me think this lower powered board would be adequate.  It is definitely so.  With MJPEG_streamer running and pumping out 3264 pixel wide images at 12fps the CPU utilization runs under 30% and only about 25% of RAM is used.

"49645","2","Seriously, what was Apple thinking?!","Sadly, Apple seems to have utterly abandoned any serious attempt at support power users and the enterprise, relying instead on the false promise of Thunderbolt and third-party accessories to bridge the gap. Such is the case here, as Apple offers ZERO 10GbE support on any of their desktop products and, with the advent of their &#34;Trashcan&#34; simply ignores the enterprise and add-on cards to support Fibre Channel and Fiber Ethernet. This *might* be acceptable if the promise of Thunderbolt lived up to its billing.\\n\\nAlas... it does not.\\n\\nEnter the Sonnet. For the low, low price of $600 (plus SFP+ transceivers that are NOT included) you can plug this GIANT box into your Trashcan or iMac Thunderbolt port and have access to your 10GbE fiber network. That sounds all well and good, but it's not. Sadly, the Rube Goldberg method of connecting your PCI-less Macs exacts a steep penalty -- and not just in price and the ugly, kludgey Black Box of Death that eviscerates any hopes  of the Trashcan becoming a hip, avant-garde, elegant solution. No, we're talking a huge performance hit! Where our blase Windows PCs get every last ounce of 10GbE goodness, this abomination manages to achieve a whopping 2.5-4Gb/s... and that on a good day. Practical speeds seldom eclipse 2Gb/s of actual transfer. We've spent hours on the phone with Sonnet support, who first attempted to accuse our network of being the problem. Since no other PC and our PCI-equipped Macs with genuine 10GbE cards seem to have no problem on the same subnet and switch we told them to &#34;Go Fish.&#34; After some tweaking on our end we managed a modest bump up to the aforementioned 2.5-4Gb/s speeds, averaging 2Gb/s or less. Before that, we weren't even hitting 1GbE speeds.\\n\\nSo, I'm not sure where to lay the lion's share of the blame here, but just know going in that this &#34;pat your head while rubbing your belly&#34; solution is sorely disappointing if you're hoping to take advantage of the performance your 10GbE network offers.","[]","B01LOXEMMS","B01LOXEMMS","AEBHAAK3XVYY6W7W6AW6EARAZBJA","2017-01-28 06:06:03.000","8","True","502"

It claims its for the A1466 and the bottom fit fine, but the top, the main reason to get a case, does not. One of the corners is protected while the other edge is exposed and no amount of adjusting fixes it. It's also basically impossible to get off without risking breaking your computer, even if you do decide to sacrifice the case. The keyboard protector is slightly off and messes with typing but it also mutes the computer significantly because thats where the speakers are. Fine if you use headphones but not if you use the built in speakers. The bottom case also covers both microphone ports, which only solidifies that it isn't truly built for the model it states. One mic is totally covered and the other is mostly covered. The screen protector is a screen protector. Nothing much to say about it, it will likely leave you with some bubbles and it doesn't fit 100% of the screen (when at the bottom edge there is a small amount of the screen exposed) It also shows smudges pretty bad, but it'll keep you from marking the computer screen by accident. Definitely getting a different case when I can find one decent enough.\\n\\nEDIT: Since getting this I have used it a bit, since I haven't wanted to drop the dime on a new case. The screen protector is still junk, the keyboard protector broke in a little bit but the muting was so significant and it impacted typing so much that I gave it up. The bottom case edge where it snaps on noticeably rubs against your wrists when using the bottom piece which can be very uncomfortable and the top case, through only once removal and readjustment since initially putting it no, and very average use (with all the transportation being in a padded sleeve in a padded bag) and the top right snap where it snaps on the computer is broken to the point that it won't stay on the computer, the bottom snap where it clicks onto the computer is basically shattered and there is no time I can recall bumping it hard enough to do that and I know it never happened when I was removing it. And there are other small cracks and scratches in the plastic.\\n\\nThis case is junk. Steer clear.

It worked well at first but I realized in order for me to reach 144hz I had to have a Display Port cable, which I didn't have. So I then went out and purchased one as well, hooked it up and changed settings from 60hz to 144hz. Outside of gaming like web browsing or something else, it ran smooth...definitely a moderate change and definitely could see the difference compared to my previous 60hz monitor. But once I played a couple games on it, I'd say about 2-5 minutes in multiple games running at mostly High-Ultra settings, I started to get that blue hue the other reviewers mentioned. I even lowered the graphical settings to low-mid cause I thought maybe it'll change, but I had to constantly keep changing it from 60hz back to 144hz in order for it to go away for a while, but then it would come right back with-in a couple of minutes. So for that reason is why I would stay away from this monitor for now at least unless MSI fixes that issue. I didn't really see a major difference in the curve as well...its suppose to draw you in, make you feel more immersed in the gaming experience...but I def didn't feel that way ha, but figured I'd try a curved  monitor. I also seen people complain about the back light bleed...but on the monitor I had, I didn't see any nor did I have any dead pixels. For the price, yea you probably can't beat it...but there are a few other comparable options out there. I ended up returning it to Micro Center and got the smaller 24&#34; Acer KG240 144hz 1080p monitor instead, set up the same way as this MSI monitor, adjusted the settings for color and Hz...put it on 144hz, played a few games on it, and def no blue hue, no bleed, no dead pixels and was cheaper compared to this model (yes, because of size). But I did find that going from a 27&#34; to a 24&#34;, you don't see as much pixilation as you would on the bigger 27&#34; so for me, it was ok to drop down in size.","[]","B01N5RD30P","B01N5RD30P","AGBXGO4M2DJS4XMMBPI5YNAREWHQ","2017-11-18 04:48:01.541","1","False","501"

After fiddling with it and troubleshooting it for the past 2 weeks, I've come to accept that I have to manually press the power button on the dash cam at each engine startup, which is a huge deal considering I've forgotten to do so here and there and could have missed a critical incident while driving.\\n\\nI've also learned that if you place your car into ACC, it'll auto-power on and record without issues. Then if you decide to go from ACC to START, for a brief second while the engine starts up, the dash cam will power off but then there will still be power as indicated by the red light on the cable.\\n\\nI did research on multiple forums and it appears to be a common issue, which may not be the camera's fault as a lot of new cars now power up the accessory sockets later after the engine powers up, however I haven't had this issue with my battery version. I've also read that even hard-wired users have had the same issue and ended up getting technical by adding a relay/delay device.\\n\\nAnyways, is what it is. Do your research and Google &#34;G1W-C won't auto-start&#34; before you order this to see if you'll fall in the same boat.\\n\\nIf the auto-start functioned as it did with my G1W-H, then this would be a 5-star since everything else works great. I'm guessing my G1W-H works fine because it's battery powered and it holds the charge during the ignition phase between OFF to START and/or ACC to START, whereas the capacitor version can't do the same probably due to some limitation of the capacitor not being able to hold the charge long enough,","[]","B00JJ3SQRI","B00JJ3SQRI","AFHH3OSWW3VN7VSZEFNZ2XQH7LBA","2017-03-14 16:37:42.000","1","True","501"
"164438","3","Lacking, I don't like it for travel","I travel often and I always carry a backpack. It is the best option for easy acces. For work I use a messenger bag also because of the easy access and it's ability to better fit files.\\n\\nThroughout school, work, and travel, I have used several backpacks. Several!\\n\\nThis one is lacking. I really wanted to like it because my travel backpack needs to be replaced. It has been traveling with me for years. To this day, the Acuvue promotional backpack is the most functional backpack I have owned.\\n\\nFor a laptop/electronics backpack, what I need is the following: a space where I can carry my work and personal items when I travel. I need it to fit: a 12 inch laptop and charger, and iPad, kindle, at least 2 power banks, cords for electronics, personal items, headphones and my airplane survival kit.\\n\\nI like that I have two pockets for water bottles or anything else but there is no space to strategically place your pens/pencils. Although this backpack has a lot of pockets, they are not what I need. Because there is no pocket/place for pens/pencils, you will have t place them in the big pockets where they are not secured and you will eventually lose them. I did, at the bottom of the backpack. It is very annoying to look for a pen in the middle of an airport when you are trying to write something.\\n\\nAn electronics backpack would also have a space for cords. There is no pocket for cords, this is a big drawback for me. This is a laptop/electronics backpack, it can do better!\\n\\nI now move onto hooks for carabiners. I use hooks/carabiners a lot. I hook a hand sanitizer to a carabiner and then to my backpack. There is no space for this here. Just the bottom part. Unless you want to look like you have a tail, I recommend you don't place any hook/carabiner there.\\n\\nI really like what I will call the &#34;middle pocket&#34; in the main compartment. It fits my iPad/kindle perfectly. The padding is good to protect your laptop and iPad. I like the size, but the inside pockets needs a better design.","[]","B06XVCMGDV","B0722Y445X","AH65J4QJTJGMTAIOUDUUQHCCHZCQ","2017-09-07 03:55:45.870","0","False","501"
"519515","5","I just couldn't get the internet even after a good two plus hours of trying","Works, is fast, is low cost and small.\\n\\nI had quite an ordeal getting the thing to work, but you can thank my DSL Internet provider CenturyLink for that. I read many reviews and took notes and tried to prepare for setting this up. Yes, I was sweating.\\n\\nOf course, it didn't work. I just couldn't get the internet even after a good two plus hours of trying. Then I used the old router (From CenturyLink that I am paying $10 a month for) and went online for some looks around. I saw a firmware update on Netgear's website and installed it. Still no internet though, and another another hour of frustration. However, this new firmware displayed more messages and all, including a message that I had the wrong PPPoE name and password. The old firmware never gave that message. I, of course, didn't believe it and tried again and again.\\n\\nThen, I went back to CenturyLink and did a chat session and got the PPPoE name and password again. AND IT WAS DIFFERENT!!! I very carefully wrote the original down and it was unusual in that the name had a &#34;@quest.net&#34; suffix. This time around, the name was the same except no suffix. the password was the same too, &#34;password123&#34;. (okay, just kidding about the password) But it was the same as before.\\n\\nI just knew it would work now, but after setting back up the Netgear modem, it didn't do anything. It was bricked. I tried over and over, power up and down a few times. Then, I used my trusty safety pin and reset the modem. (I did it several times before getting the proper name and, of course, it didn't help) Well, after a reset, and entering the right name and password, it said the Internet was up! But, of course, my computer didn't load anything. Just before jumping out of the window, I restarted my computer. . . .\\n\\nAll smooth sailing now. Everything works. If I had the right PPPoE name up front, I probably would have been up in under a half hour. Instead, on and off, it took most of the day.","[]","B01HTAPPJE","B01N0FGGBR","AEX72LHG3C5F4KMI6EPUKGHOZXUQ","2017-03-21 05:06:20.000","37","True","501"
"546207","5","Awesome Headphones... That come with different size ear pieces!!!","I am back with an update 6-6-2017 (I have provided photos this time) STILL 5 STAR!!\\nAfter losing my first pair, I came back to amazon and bought my 2nd pair. Anyways, after reading a lot of these bad reviews, I come to a logical conclusion as to why people are crying about these great headphones. If you noticed in the package, Samsung gives you 4 different size and shape soft rubber ear fittings that make a world of difference in the way these headphones fit your ears and in turn makes a huge difference in the way they sound. If they are not properly plugged into your ear and are simply not in &#34;your ear hole&#34; then they will sound like dog **** and may feel uncomfortable (Example) If you have small ear holes and your cramming the larger provided ear pieces up in your ears, they will be very uncomfortable and may not even be in your ear properly which makes them sound like dog ****. In this case of course then you need to try using a smaller ear piece size. Like I said they provide 4 different shapes and sizes, &#34;I use the smallest ones&#34; and they feel great and stay snug while I'm going at it in the gym. As far as sound quality, I'm a sound producer, I have 2 pair of professional headphones in my studio that sound amazing (Audio Technica ATH-M50 & and the Sony MDR 7506) and these Samsung lvl's really do sound great... Specially for 50 bux or even $100 which is what I paid at the gate when they came out!!! Check the photos and don't be a knuckle head ; )\\n\\n-----------OLD 5 STAR REVIEW-------------\\nIm not sure why other people are rating these buds poorly. I paid $100 from bestbuy and I still love them more then what I was using. The sound is nice and clear and they never shook loose during my 2 1/2 hour workout session tonight or any other night. They feel good and did not hurt my ears at all towards the end of my workout like my other cheap earbuds did. I can walk around my gym with out my phone and it never misses a beat! My gym is a good 3500 sq feet. I have a feeling the people leaving bad reviews are just #W@$%WF #$%#$F!!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+9ZxvwN2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+9ZxvwN2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+9ZxvwN2L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717FJmuTYJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717FJmuTYJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717FJmuTYJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71O2doVK24L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71O2doVK24L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71O2doVK24L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bJd15276L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bJd15276L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bJd15276L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kIlzdhcSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kIlzdhcSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kIlzdhcSL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zhu1n5r-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zhu1n5r-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zhu1n5r-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01JQXW702","B01JQXW702","AEITQA2X25G6M2U7K6IL5MPEN76A","2017-02-01 06:28:43.000","16","False","501"
"104383","4","Less fingerprints, more glare on iPad Air","I recently got an amFilm protector for my phone, and I loved it! So I decided to try this one for my iPad Air (original model). My iPad has never had a screen protector on it before, and has been a real fingerprint magnet.\\n\\nWhen installing this protector it is essential to completely remove all dust, dirt, or other debris on the screen. It's a lot harder to clean a tablet's screen than a phone, due to the larger area. I followed the advice in the instructions, and worked in a steamed-up bathroom. First I used a damp microfiber cloth to clean the screen, then wiped it with a dry one. I used the flashlight on my phone to check for remaining dirt, and I had to repeat the process a few times until the iPad's screen looked spotless. Next I used the wet and dry cleaners included with the protector, followed by the adhesive strips to remove a few remaining spots of dust and lint. Finally I quickly applied the protector before any more stray dust could land on the screen. I found it easy to correctly align the protector by lining up its holes with the iPad's home button and front camera. Much to my amazement, I got a dust free installation. There were some large bubbles that took a bit of work to rub out. I found the included squeegee card to be useless; I had better luck rubbing out the bubbles with my fingers. There were a few stubborn bubbles that remained, but I was able to rub them out a few hours later - it's possible they were caused by moisture on the screen that eventually evaporated.\\n\\nI am very happy with this protector. Its oleophobic coating seems to work better than the one on my iPad's screen. As a result, fingerprints are less noticeable and easier to clean off than they were on the bare screen. There does seem to be a bit more glare using the protector than there was when using the bare screen.\\n\\nI don't see any difference in touch sensitivity when using the protector.\\n\\nI can feel the thickness of the glass protector when pushing in the home button, and I have to apply more force than before to get the home button all the way in. This took a bit of getting used to. I would prefer if the cutout for the home button was a bit larger.\\n\\nDefinitely a great protector!","[]","B00RNGOBYK","B00RNGOBYK","AEAN2DOEXIKUECPSJ5OWE4VVHVYA","2017-03-31 17:26:21.000","0","True","501"
"439222","1","Good looking, great concept, GOLF BUDDY CUSTOMER SUPPORT FAIL","I just received my LD2 two days ago.  Looks very nice.  I like the concept of a ladies' design range finder that is not so large and bulky.  This was a repackaged item from Amazon, so I was taking a risk that there may have been a flaw, but was willing to do so in order to save a bit on price.  There were no visible flaws, however, after downloading all of the course information per the instructions, I tried to &#34;log in&#34; to my home course (at the course) and the LD2 gave me the &#34;NO COURSE DATA&#34; error message.  Okay, maybe there is a glitch or something I did wrong - I'm not uber tech savvy.  So I went on-line for customer support with Golf Buddy so I could talk or chat with someone who could maybe walk me through.  It was NOT to be.  The website (which does have really good videos showing how to use the LD2) seems like it does everything to avoid speaking or chatting with a customer.  The one phone number I called referred me to a &#34;help&#34; website that basically told me that I would be charged $5 (refundable) to make an inquiry.  Really??  Then I found another phone number to the company on their Facebook page which I called (in California).  I pressed any option that might take me to a customer support person, only to get that &#34;no one is at that extension&#34;...even when I hit &#34;0&#34; to get an operator.  Then I sent an email to  customer support on the Golf Buddy website only to get a response this morning that they had received my email and that it &#34;may take 4-6 weeks to complete&#34; my inquiry.  Nah, I don't think so. Golf Buddy really needs to up their game as far as customer support  - which many previous reviews of the product on Amazon had already pointed out.  Thought I might have a better experience. I'm packing my Golf Buddy LD2 up today to return and will look for another brand.  It's a shame because I really like the idea and the design of the LD2 and wish I could make it work, but lack of ANY customer support is sending me packing.","[]","B019I8KC9S","B019I8KC9S","AEW2NH6AGTHLEBBV4FI5PPQD5EHQ","2017-02-04 14:53:44.000","5","True","501"

However, the issues I encountered are mostly related to software design and have more to do with imagination than money.\\nI bought it for gym so the usage mode is mostly random playing all songs when quality does not matter much and internal storage is sufficient. I needed two things out of it:\\n- be able to set up custom equalizer to boost headphone sound\\n- be able to quickly skip a song\\nUnfortunately, none of the above is straightforward.\\nIt took me 20 minutes to figure out how custom equalizer works and then another 10 minutes to set it up: buttons seem to have random effect in this mode.\\nSkipping a song sequence depends on the mode. If it's still awake you need to only press &#34;left&#34;. If it &#34;fell asleep&#34; you need to waken it up first, THEN press &#34;left&#34;. The &#34;wake up&#34; button is the same as &#34;pause&#34; in normal operation. Other buttons significantly change their meaning depending on the mode, too. So it gets very annoying.\\nThe screen is barely readable but the way I use the player it hardly matters.\\nI'd give it 4 stars for sound, build, battery life but 1 star at best for the software and usability.

"832792","3","The good and the bad (but it's mostly good)","The quality of this wall mount is very good.  Seems to be a solid design and decent quality construction.  It looks like it can handle up to 100lbs, although my use is only 50lbs.  It is the best designed and best built wall mount that I have purchased to date. I only rated it 3 stars for the following reasons:\\n1) It states repeatedly in the description, header and specs that it can provide &#34;Full Motion TV Wall Mount with 32 inch Long Extension for 42 to 80 inch TVs&#34;.  I interpret this to mean 180 degree movement for TVs up to 80 inches.  THIS IS NOT TRUE.  It looks like it can provide 180 degree motion for TVs up to 40 to 45 inches . . . maybe more.  I have a 60&#34; Samsung and as mounted per the directions, it cannot swing out to the full 90 degrees each way.  The edge of the TV hits the wall at the 75 degree mark.\\n2) As I've bought a number of wall mounts from different places for this application and none of them have worked (I need a FULL 90 degree movement side to side), I decided that I will modify the design to allow the full travel in at least one direction.  I tried contacting the manufacturer via their website to ask about loading and whether my design idea would put too much stress on the arms and pivot points.  Unfortunately, they did not respond to my inquiry.  So I marked them down a star for poor customer responsiveness.\\n\\nI went ahead and modified the design to allow movement in one direction and it seems to work really well.  In fact, the design is such that I can even extend the TV out even farther, which is a bonus.  Unfortunately, I have no idea whether this is reliable or not as the manufacturer did not respond to my inquiry.  But it is testament to the quality and construction that it even works at all!\\n\\nMy advice, if you have a TV in the 40 to 45 inch range (and maybe even 50 inch), this is a FANTASTIC mount.  It will not break! It is very smooth. The mount plate allows you to mount it to 2 studs, giving you much more confidence in it.  If your TV is larger than 50 inches and you don't need full +/- 90 degrees travel, this is a GREAT mount.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ek5HyMUvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ek5HyMUvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ek5HyMUvL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tEOUpQTgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tEOUpQTgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tEOUpQTgL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B004JVAIEY","B004JVAIEY","AHSE3E5VNN2T5KVQRMNNHWPZATWA","2017-01-22 17:03:14.000","32","True","501"
"835024","3","There's more here than is being clearly advertised, and you might not like it.","All the great capabilities.... but only if you use Intel. Want to use m.2 drives on the DIMM.2 for VROC? They MUST be intel m.2. Oh and you need a special Intel hardware key that hasn't come out yet. Asus doesnt really fill us in on that stuff. They just want us to buy the motherboard. I did. It's built like a tank. You can plug 3 m.2 ssds into it. Essentially having your OS drive and scratch disks on the board. That is awesome. But thats were it ends folks. Nothing really special that I can tell. It was a pain to configure. The bios is sketchy. To do one thing in the bios its 2 steps forward and 3 back before you can proceed. Honestly I dont get the hype on this board. It may be because its too new but theres some older stuff on it. Not too old, no 1394 connections but U.2 connections. Drives that are overpriced and difficult to obtain. Same with the good intel stuff. Maybe Im overly critical but this thing just doesnt knock my socks off. I still cant figure out how to turn the LEDs to different colors or off for that matter. If you do buy this board be aware you'll want additional fans (small ones) for the Dimm.2 and the other heat spreader over the processor. They dont come with it. Just the brackets. I will say, this board with a 7920x and a corsair h100i v2 has the i9 at under 30C. Under load I saw it get up to 58. The board will automatically overclock if you want it to and it can do that a couple of different ways. pretty neat i guess. I tried it for the hell of it and it ran the 7920x at 3.8ghz in auto. Cinebench R15 scored 2483 with no raid, just M.2 and the stock clock settings and just two 16gb 2666 sticks of ram which is decent. I think it could be better with faster drives, ram in quad channel and a modest overclock. Jury is still out on this thing for me. There seems to be a lot of potential but it also feels like a lot of that &#34;potential&#34; is smoke and mirrors unless you are related very closely to someone at intel who can hook you up with the good stuff.","[]","B074JCV2QL","B074JCV2QL","AFF3Y4EXR5N5GTMMBCKU4MNTVLNQ","2017-12-07 03:29:12.611","9","True","501"
"386044","5","Worth the splurge","I work from home, so reliable internet is a must. I had been relying on plugging in the DSL when the Cable went out, and even though I didn't have to do it much, it got old fast when I did. I decided it was time to splurge on a dual WAN router. The choices in my price range were kind of limited, and most didn't sound too hot. I went with this one mostly because everything else looked like undisputed junk. But I am so happy I did.\\n\\nIt worked flawlessly out of the box. For a while I was leery of enabling both WANs at once (worried about certificate errors and that sort of thing) and had the DSL on standby. It is a cold standby, meaning it takes time to start up the second WAN and and get an IP and stuff. I would have liked something a little more &#34;instant&#34;, but there is no easy way. The website forums said you can set prioritization rules that accomplish the same thing, but I still wonder why they didn't just enable it with a simple setting.\\n\\nSo, here's where it gets good. I decided to try it in load-balancing mode. And boy, I'm not disappointed. It works great. No errors on any sites, and when downloading games off Steam, pure bandwidth aggregation. I will never go back to standby as long as I have a competitive backup WAN connection.\\n\\nThe amount of features are great. You can do everything you'd expect from a small business class router and then some. One thing I liked was the ability to bind separate No-IP addresses to the different WANs. The one thing that I have to say I *didn'*t like was that the firewall came with the &#34;All&#34; rule set to pass. I don't know if they figured their users would be savvy enough to configure it themselves or if they wanted to avoid pointless tech calls from users not savvy enough to set firewall rules, or both. In any case, take note of that and enable it first thing.\\n\\nTo summarize:\\n\\n++ Load balancing works great\\n++ Tons of features\\n-- No hot standby setting\\n-- Out of the box firewall set to allow all","[]","B0042210U6","B0BC8KZ6Q5","AHBKG4NW2E5HNY4EHYBPYHIOJLVQ","2017-03-20 07:49:20.000","41","True","501"

The LG 38&#34; that I replaced it with is certainly crisper, but man I miss the screen space and beautiful look of the hardware itself. I desperately wish the resolution was better.\\n\\nThe one and only positive for me so far is the look. I’m coming from two 2008-ish Mac Cinema HD monitors. I’m not a gamer, and I did read and watch reviews by non-gamers. I am a content creator, but this is for my home. At work, I have two newer 27” Apple Thunderbolt Displays with 2560x1440 resolution.\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed after hooking it up was the poor text quality. Serious aliasing. Someone commented that sitting further away helps. I didn’t find that to be the case.\\n\\nI opened Cinema 4D, Premiere and some of my other apps. Wowed by the screen space but underwhelmed again by the low resolution and stretching. The quality is poorer than my old monitors.\\n\\nI tried Apple display adjustments. It shows “low resolution,” and Apple can’t do anything about that. I called Samsung. They read from the web just like me. I called Amazon’s tech support as it was a prompt when I requested a return. The man I spoke with offered a solution but said I had to be at the monitor. I wasn’t. He said to call when I was. I called after work only to speak with ‘tech support’ without a clue and even told me they don’t support it after I’d been told they do. They suggested I return it after I already told them that I’d started a return.

"15265","4","Great value.","I own a Piper NV, but decided to install the Zmodo Pivot  at my farm because the price was $99 with two door sensors versus $279 for the piper NV with no door sensors.\\n\\nThe installation app was pretty straight, but I had issues getting the device to recognize my wireless network.  Waited 1 hour for tech support, but eventually go someone speaking good english.  I learned the following through the setup process, some from the manual, some through support.\\n1.  The instructions say the WiFi network name CAN&#34;T have a space.  I had to remove the space in the name of my network which also had the consequence of having to retrain my wireless thermostats to the &#34;new&#34; network.\\n2.  Even though all my devices (iPad, iPhone, computers) could see my network fine with decent signal, the Zmodo wouldn't link up to the network, even though it found the network.  I had to place the router and the Zmodo next to each other for the Zmodo to connect to the network.  Once it was connected, I was able to place the Zmodo where I wanted and it worked fine.\\n3.  Once the Zmodo connected to the network and I placed it where I wanted, I was able to add the door/window sensors from that location without a problem.\\n4.  I did electrical work on the house later in the day, requiring me to shut off power to the house multiple times.  Each time the device reconnect to the network.\\n5.  I have a lousy internet connection at the farm (2 MBSp), yet when I am remote and logging into the Zmodo, I get the videos fairly quickly.\\n\\nPros:  Good Price for what you get.  Love the ability to see 360 and for it to look in the direction of the triggered event.  Tech support was helpful, but it took awhile on hold to get through.\\nCons:  Doesn't send texts or emails.  That addition would make it a 5 star product\\n\\nBottom line:  I would buy this again.  Just read the directions before install, NO Spaces in the network name and have the router and Zmodo next to each other during setup.","[]","B01A52KLTC","B01A52KLTC","AGO33AF4N5O5OFPFYC6JUI6GUJOQ","2017-05-14 01:44:40.000","2","True","501"
"133185","5","Glorious Sound, Great Versatility","This is an amazing receiver. It is versatile and works well for so many uses: television, phono (a built-in MM cartridge input is increasingly rare these days), Blu-ray, AppleTV, Spotify, Pandora, SiriusXM, AirPlay, USB Hi-Def Audio, and radio (over-the-air and through the Internet). The unit even has Bluetooth that I use for headphones and a bathroom speaker. The iPhone and iPad apps available for free from Yamaha, AV Controller and MusicCast, make it easy to control all aspects of the receiver. As for AirPlay, it is a snap to stream anything right from your iPhone, the receiver will turn on automatically and you can control the sound using the volume buttons or slider from right within Apple Music or Spotify.\\n\\nNow onto sound. Glorious. I like the Pure Direct mode the best. That shuts off all extraneous circuitry to give a beautiful sound direct from source to amplifier to speaker. The uncompressed difference between this and any other digitally enhanced mode is quite noticeable. However, when listening to a movie through one of Yamaha’s digital modes like Sci-Fi, you can simulate the sound of a movie theatre quite well in a relatively small room.\\n\\nFor me, the RX-A1070 is in use constantly throughout the day and night. Setting up multiple speakers, I have a 5.1 system, was easy using a little provided microphone, which you may place on a camera tripod where us listen most, evaluated the correct setting for each speaker. I also use speakers in my bedroom room which can which can replicate the sound in my living room (in sync) or play an entirely different program. The second room even has a separate volume control on the remote or in the app or even on a web page.\\n\\nYamaha has put a lot of thought and development into the RX-A1070. I’ve had it for about three months and my experience keeps getting deeper and better as I learn more of the amazing capabilities offered through the apps.\\n\\nYamaha is a quality mark that has given me great musical joy from my piano to my flute. When it comes to stereo, to use my favored retro term, Yamaha delivers in so many ways with this new, state-of-the-art, receiver. I recommend the RX-A1070 without a single reservation.","[]","B071XTXXSR","B071XTXXSR","AELEF4AVZ6ECLWH6FQKLI7YEC6YA","2017-10-07 13:48:21.923","37","False","501"
"686455","5","Why Vinyl Is STILL BETTER Than Digital","Measuring about the size of a small 10 to 14-inch laptop PC, but 5 inches deep, this is the perfect portable and stowaway companion for my 40-plus years of LPs. Yes, it also sounds just right through the two small front facing stereo speakers. This Victrola is also a bigger eargasm when using my larger stereo speakers or extra-bass headphones. To use my medium sized Bluetooth speakers, I will soon buy a RCA cable Bluetooth transmitter for the turntable's RCA output connector on the back.\\n\\nThe build and sound quality reminds me so much like the portable album and &#34;45&#34; players we had for pop-up parties at school or hang-outs at a girlfriend's house. Yet, it's almost as light as my small laptop PC. This was truly a great buy that I will get a lot of regular use from playing all my &#34;33s&#34; and &#34;45s&#34; again, and buying some current artists on vinyl. Even my Dad's surviving &#34;78s&#34; also sound awesome, but are rough on the easily replaceable stylus.\\n\\nTrust this for certain, uncompressed analog audio sounds much fuller and impressive than the compressed digital sound we've gotten used to over the last 25 years. Don't believe it? Well, you'll hear the same distinct similarities that those mostly &#34;old head&#34; jurors heard and knew when listening to the Blurred Lines song (Pharrell and Thicke) while clearly remembering the sounds from Marvin Gayes' worldwide 1977 hit and party jam, Got to Give It Up. &#34;Old head&#34; ears (like me) are more attuned to hearing a much fuller spectrum of sounds, ranges and rhythms than people who have only listened to compressed digitized music. Simply, it just sounds more full, real and live.\\n\\nEven the price on this 3-speed stereo turntable was under $50 perfect. It's well worth buying for all those middle and subtle sounds I've been missing in my music and comedy albums. Buy this Victrola portable record player, and FINALLY get your 21st century musical head and ears right --- at a low cost. Your mind, body, soul and ears will thank you.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-YCAS-EAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-YCAS-EAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-YCAS-EAL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712KCi9CsnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712KCi9CsnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712KCi9CsnL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713xyr4bXIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713xyr4bXIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713xyr4bXIL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719gmwfqaEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719gmwfqaEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719gmwfqaEL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EnCqTCIXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EnCqTCIXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EnCqTCIXL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Kzob0H9jL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Kzob0H9jL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Kzob0H9jL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71U8d9MfEHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71U8d9MfEHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71U8d9MfEHL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iBZPKuRQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iBZPKuRQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iBZPKuRQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00UMVW4VA","B0BMQN7L6B","AHUK4LJGTLHGSBEOLPVEWTSK6GOA","2017-02-16 16:33:07.000","390","True","501"
"599325","5","Fast, Cheap, and Quiet -- What's Not to Like?","I had completely given up on full-sized external hard drives. They are heavy, noisy, require a power supply connection, and generally are matched in storage size by their diminutive, ubiquitous  3.5&#34; counterparts. So why the five-star review here? Well, sheerly out of desperation, I bought this because I needed a large storage drive for a relatively massive file transfer process I was about to undertake.\\n\\nBoy did this turn out well. Yes, it is still big. But it is surprisingly quiet, and actually looks good, with a beveled black case and integrated rubber feet. But more importantly, not only does this thing hold 8 (yes, you read that right, EIGHT) gigabytes of data, but it is fast, fast, fast. When I connect it to my laptop, I routinely get 160Mb/s transfer speeds, blowing away the standard USB 3.0 speed of about 100 Mb/s. I must say I was completely surprised. Is it because perhaps they have put in a 7,800 or even a 10,000 rpm drive in it? Or that perhaps an integrated SCSI interface? I don't know, because I haven't opened the case (and don't plan to). But the speed and quietness of this thing is amazing for a traditional mechanical drive. And when one considers the ridiculously low cost of the unit -- only $180 for eight gigabytes of space -- it hits all the right bells. Bought out of forced desperation, it is now a favorite drive of mine. Five stars.\\n\\nNOTE:\\nA word of caution that applies to ALL storage, not just this device. When someone purchases a drive this size, it is usually for backup reasons (like it was for me). REMEMBER THAT A BACKUP IS ONLY A BACKUP IF YOU HAVE A *DUPLICATE* COPY OF THE DATA SOMEWHERE. So, if you copy your data from your computer to this drive, then delete that data off your computer, THAT IS NOT A BACKUP. It may be an &#34;archive,&#34; but it is certainly not a backup. If the drive fails, you may lose your data. You have to DUPLICATE your data in TWO SEPARATE LOCATIONS to have a true backup. It's just worth reminding everyone of that because it is easy to forget.","[]","B01HAPGEIE","B088PZR86K","AF7G4AGU43VKWFVSHFQS4L72EQ6Q","2017-06-24 13:24:51.941","8","True","501"
"803045","3","An excellent, fun flying camera with software glitches and range limits","When everything works correctly, I'd give this 5 stars for ease of use and picture quality.  I took one star off for software glitches and another star off for a combination of the price at $500 and the range limit of about 60 feet.  For reasons neither I understood, nor they explained, I was able to buy this for less than half of retail at a local electronics store; it was the only one they had.\\n\\nThis is controlled via WiFi through a smartphone.  If it goes beyond about 60' and loses communication it stops where and as it is until the battery runs out.  The battery is good for 6 to 8 minutes; there is an indicator on the screen. The instructions it comes with are inadequate so you'll need to get on YouTube, and just try the options.  The good news is it is light, relatively sturdy, remarkably stable and moves at modest speeds so you have to work to crash it. Some of the commands and controls are intuitive, but not all; aiming the camera for example isn't obvious and the directional controls sometimes seem backwards.  Up and down are the only commands that are intuitive and consistent.\\n\\nThe batteries charge relatively quickly, 15 to 30 minutes, but the instructions warn you not to charge them until they've cooled down.  The batteries get hot in use so I've been going with a 15 minute cool down and then charge.  The charger handles both batteries simultaneously, so in general, you're looking at 30+ minutes between charges and 14 minutes flying time with the total of 2 batteries.\\n\\nThe pictures are terrific.  The software glitch is that the camera may hoard them.  Sometimes the pictures show up on the cell phone in the camera directory, sometimes in the phone's &quot;gallery&quot; and sometimes they stay in the drone and you have to turn it on, link it to your phone and go through a &quot;memory management&quot; download of each file.  Several times while flying, even at close range without obstructions, the drone and camera have lost link.  The drone freezes in place and the software goes through a connection process; it can take multiple tries and 2 minutes.  This seems to be common to many drones.\\n\\nThere are a lot of drone choices, but it's tough to find one with the camera quality of the Hover Passport.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XFKd+P9BL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XFKd+P9BL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XFKd+P9BL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B071NNHF52","B071NNHF52","AEFWA4RPS6UJZNM3VYR3YC7AFMBQ","2017-09-18 22:05:57.053","42","False","501"

I did not receive compensation in any way for writing this review.\\n\\nI am a sucker to have tried these headphones. They did not have many reviews, but I was like, &#34;what the hay, I'll try it out! They're expensive so they have to be good!&#34; Boy was I wrong. I bought these to play pc games and talk in voice chats with friends at the same time. Every single 20 dollar pair of headphones can do the job 'okay' but I wanted something special! Something good! So I looked on amazon, refined my search and found these bad boys. That's where it all began...\\n\\nInitial thoughts: it came in an 'okay looking' black box, but when you unzip the box it actually looks super cool. Like professional sound equipment with the Styrofoam padding on the walls of the box. I connected it through bluetooth with no problems, and started playing music. The music is amazing, sound quality was so much better than my 4 year old $50 headset I had before. &#34;This is going to be amazing&#34;, I think to myself &#34;when I talk to my buds and play video games!&#34;\\n\\nI Enter a voice chat and nobody can hear me. I can hear them just fine. I diddle with the audio and find that there are two playback settings, Mono-audio and stereo-audio. The mono-audio is the only one you can talk out of and the voice quality i was producing was of a dying robot. My friends asked me to burn my headset (yes it was that bad). Also, my game went from sounding amazing to utter trash because it forced the earphones into &#34;mono-audio&#34; as well. I was so disappointed, soundmagic turned into soundtragic right before my eyes.\\n\\nLong story short, if you want to use this solely for audio (which why would you get the one with a mic) then its great!

"265227","3","Lots of features but also frustration","This receiver is cutting edge in some ways and frustratingly backwards in others.  It offers Atmos and DTS:X support as well as 4K HDR (although not Dolby Vision).  All of the HDMI inputs and outputs are HDCP 2.2, although the Video 1 input is more limited than the others (not tested but this was buried in the fine print in the manual).  This is the flagship receiver for Sony's consumer line, but Sony also markets a more expensive ES line of products.  As a result, there are some cut corners (like the Video 1 input) and some odd design choice (like only having 2 height channels instead of the recommended 4 but then adding a second zone) EDIT - I was initially under the impression that the second zone was separate from the height channels but instead it is an alternative to the height channels (they cannot be used at the same time) It makes more sense as a design choice, however switching between using zone 2 and enabling heights requires digging deep into menu settings each time it is done.\\n\\nThe biggest failing is the remote.  While there are 6 HDMI inputs, two cannot be accessed without going through an on-screen menu.  However, there is a button dedicated to picking the first of four custom preset settings and a button directed to enabling a front surround mode which is already accessible via the movie button and will most likely never be used by anyone who actually has surround speakers.  There is also a DSD native button for those few who have an SACD player and want to toggle the playback mode.\\n\\nAside from the remote, there were a few other frustrations.  One of these is the lack of an info setting when using the OSD.  Knowing what resolution and audio stream is being received is helpful in trying to troubleshoot, such as for example, when there is no sound when there should be sound.  While the receiver has two outputs for subwoofers, there is only one level control for the sub.\\n\\nOverall, while this receiver does offer many new features, it also can be frustrating to set up and use.  There is also a value question as competitors with receivers in the same price range have announced they will send firmware updates to add Dolby Vision support. As there seems to be increasing support for Dolby Vision, this could be a dealbreaker for many if it is not rectified.","[]","B06XKRWWSG","B06XKRWWSG","AEQ4WIM7ULSVAK7HRV5U3LLC6QHA","2017-04-20 03:26:07.000","37","False","501"

"905117","3","Good in current form for average home users","Wish is was worth the hefty price tag, but it's not. Beamforming does not work. MU-MIMO does not work. Well, they don't work if you have Apples devices in your home. There is a lot of discussion on Netgear Forums right now about these selling points that don't deliver. This thing worked flawlessly the first two days and then my WiFi dropped out of nowhere. This router takes some time to reboot or re-broadcast WiFi. I checked the router and it was pulsing white as it was coming back online. I then went back upstairs to see the Satellite in its pulsing magenta phase. Then a few moments later it went solid blue to show it was back online.\\n\\nNot even fifteen minutes went by and it dropped again. Short back story. I bought so I'd have a mesh network and a solid backbone for gaming through the satellite in my bedroom due to issues with my aging powerline adapters. It worked fine when gaming. What I later found out about why the network was dropping was related to my daughter using her iPod while she was in our room. Her iPod connected to the satellite which in turn caused the router or satellite to absolutely lose everything.\\n\\nAfter some research, I found that Beamforming and MU-MIMO just don't work with this equipment at all or with some devices. Seems Nest devices are a serious headache with Orbi if those two settings are present. Same with my Apple devices (10 total) if they are online. I turned those settings off and the network outages stopped, however, I was still catching extreme latency if something wireless connected to the satellite. Even my wife's Surface Pro 4 would cause severe lag. Can't explain it one bit.\\n\\nAll in all I think they serve a purpose for most, but not for my household where there are gamers and kids who stream nonstop. I decided to revert back to my Archer C3200 router which doesn't have these issues. I just wanted mesh instead access points and extenders...blah blah blah. I'm actually curious about using MOCA 2.0. Just learned about them instead of using the powerline adapters. Check that out as well. For the average household, I believe this equipment will work fine. For the gamers and such, maybe not so much if a wireless device starts streaming from the satellite you're connected to.","[]","B01K4CZOBS","B0BT1BTW94","AF3XYGMNJHZGXBBQAYKXEJGCGZWA","2017-04-17 18:28:38.000","1","True","501"

It starting freezing up on and off for awhile, now it's totally unresponsive. This was with very light use by my kids only doing one or two game apps occasionally. I followed the directions online about plugging it in and holding the power button down for 40 seconds. No response. Called Amazon and they informed me there is nothing they can do because it's past the 90-day warranty. They offered me a small discount toward the purchase of another. I will not waste my money on this terrible cheap product ever again. What a complete waste!!!!!!!!\\n\\nI ordered the 2-pack intending to use them mainly for entertainment for my kids to do apps and videos, especially when we travel. Because they are mainly for the kids to play with, we decided to get these instead of investing in 2 new iPads. We have had these for a few days and have gotten them up and running and have installed a few apps. It remains to be seen how they perform in the long term, but a few things stand out to me right away after only having them for a few days.\\n1) Parental control options are very cumbersome. I'm glad to have them, but something as simple as setting a password proved to be difficult. Still can't figure out what the difference really is between the parent control password and the password you can set just to have the thing turn on. My kids figured out the password accidentally and changing it was cumbersome because I had to change it in two different places and it took a lot of figuring out and was annoying.\\n2) The screen requires a different type of touch than an iPad. The Fire screen is just not as responsive or clear. I find myself having to sometimes tap multiple times to get it to respond, something I don't have to do with my iPad.\\n3) Lots of advertising, especially for mature content like books and videos, etc. which we don't want.\\n\\nOnce I figure out all the options for parental controls, limiting access to mature content, ads, etc (if I can) it will probably turn out to be a good purchase, especially since it is so much cheaper than the iPad and we only want it for games for the kids. But if I had unlimited $$ I would choose an iPad any day, for sure.","[]","B01AHBBG04","B01BRWH8G8","AFUWWILGV4S4REM7JYADRNS44YLA","2017-04-26 18:30:39.000","0","True","501"
"724543","4","this is by far the best keyboard I have ever owned","I have to say, and this is only after 10 minutes of use, this is by far the best keyboard I have ever owned, even from Razer for many reasons. Would have waited for the Chroma to come out but since I was always a fan of the Razer membrane keys on my Nostromo and Tartaros I just had to see what this hybrid was like. For someone that likes clicky keys, this is a super find, but having been using the BlackWidow Chroma Clicky Mechanical Gaming Keyboard for the last few months, one thing I was not a fan of was how high the keys were and how hypersensitive they were, causing me to make constant typos. The keys on this Ornata, not only are at the perfect height for typing and gaming (without promoting easy accidental actuation by grazing a key while navigating the keyboard), but they have a feel like no other keyboard that I have ever owned. They seem to have the tactile feel of the mechanical, but the resistance more in line with their older membrane keyboards. I also have to add, one thing I never loved about Razer keyboards was the strange font on the keys and the fact that alternate items (like _, +, &, ^, and *, etc.) were never backlit, just the primary button function while the alternate function was always just printed in white. These 2 changes not only make this keyboard easier to read for those that occasionally need to look at the keyboard to type, but perfect in the dark and for those with not so hot eyesight like myself. I do like the fact that the wrist rest is not only a nice addition, but is is magnetic, so no clicking or snapping it off when not needed, you just pull it off with ease. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was because of 3 minor things. The fact that when the legs are extended the keyboard is still not at an angle that makes a notable difference when typing, the cord seems to fall out of the track at the center of the keyboard way too easily when I move the keyboard a bit (not unlike their mouse bungee clip at the base) and third that not all keys seem to have a consistent click sound, certain keys have a more muffed click making me wonder about the longevity of the device. Otherwise, the best keyboard I have ever used and I fully plan to get the Chroma version once released and then use this one for by backup PC.","[]","B01LDVQTEA","B01LDVQTEA","AEMU66YIYPWK477RBRLPITUN6CHQ","2017-01-11 17:49:52.000","3","True","501"
"327327","2","Charge Anything All Day","Very well made product. Well thought out. Bright (Sunlight readable) display that is very informative. Enough differant types of plugs to satiisfy any need from A/C to DC. Good carry handle. Very large capacity battery 412 Wh, that charges any combination of lap tops, iPads, cameras, Drone batteries, A/C chargers.\\n\\nUnderstand what this battery will do: It does not take the place of a 2,000 Watt Generator, rather its available power is more geared to charging personal devices like lap tops, GPS, phones and cameras. Sure it will run A/C lights, drills and TV's, but not for a real long time, since you are running the inverter then. If you want to play All day with Drones, Cameras and Lap Tops, then this is just the ticket!  Put it on the outdoor table and let the whole gang charge away all day. Great for the kids on a long car trip or day out. Safe pure sign wave inverter.\\nThere seems to be a little confusion from the EcoFlow Web site and Dealers as to the battery capacity: The EcoFlow site states 116,000mAh, and the box it comes in says 114,000mAh. Both say 412Wh.  The box says it will run a Refrigerator. Well a Very little one at best, since most household refrigerators need about 2,000 Watts to start, and the Max draw on the River A/C inverter is only 300 Watts.\\nI did not get the solar panel, but this would be a very nice addition if camping.\\n\\nCustomer Service: After fixing a glitch of not answering the phone, they are now say they are eager, friendly and happy to help.\\nUpdate: 07/06/17 : Customer service stated they would call back...They did not.\\n\\nCONS: Nit pick, but I think the Auto-Off should turn off the A/C and DC much sooner than 8 and 12 hours. It should Definitely come with a case that holds the charger and cables for $700!  Expect the charger to get very warm while charging.\\n\\nOverall I would recommend the EcoFlow River to anyone that wants to charge personal devices, have an emergency power source and not run out of power.\\nRegretfully I question the customer support .","[]","B072LV6VBS","B072LV6VBS","AF3DYD3KZD7WRANBMHI65YXG3W3Q","2017-07-06 19:46:55.914","5","True","501"
"941747","4","No Sleep 'Till....","I may come back and write some thoughts on my impressions of audio quality at a later time, but for now I'll leave it up to those with more experience in the arena. (see update below)\\n\\nI would like to point out that, at least for me, the T0's will not go into sleep mode with an optical connection.  I confirmed this with a wattage meter and it consumes 6.5 watts of power and the amp heatsink is very hot.  That just might be the nature of it, that light is coming through the pipe as long as my computer is on, and there's no way for the speaker to tell if it carries audio signal or not.  I had to switch to USB and that seems to have cleared up the problem.  I have not tested the wattage, but the back plate is cool so I assume it's down to the .5 watt draw in sleep mode.\\n\\nUPDATE 10-06-17:  I really enjoy these speakers.  They are so clear that I find myself listening to a wider variety of music now just to enjoy the sound.  I wouldn't say it's like &#34;hearing music for the very first time&#34;. I wouldn't go that far.  But it does say something that when I get home from vacation I look forward to getting back to my desk so I can listen to these more.  I added an 8&#34; Klipsch sub and I think you're doing yourself a disservice by not using one.  It's not just all about bass, but the speakers actually get louder when the crossover kicks in.  It's been a little hard for me to dial it in but I think I'm getting there.  Plus it's nice that if you need to turn the bass up or down for a particular song you have the remote to easily do so.  I also installed Equalizer APO on my PC to make some minor tweaks to adjust for my taste.  I would also recommend raising them up off your desktop a few inches for clearer sound and also closer to your ears.  I have them on some makeshift stands right now but ordered the small IsoAcoustics pretty much for aesthetic reasons.  Good stuff, and I'm glad I got them for the intro $300 price!

"32650","4","Great Sound When Using The Digital Option - Terrible Sound with Analog Option","I'm reviewing the Sonos Connect (not Connect Amp).  Sonos equipment expects you to have already have a home wi-fi network.\\nPros:\\nSonos Connect brings many streaming audio services (some free, some not) to your existing wired home stereo.  (Example, Amazon Prime Music)\\nThe Sonos controller app brings much flexibility to the Connect box.\\nPlays music stored on your computer through your home stereo.\\nSonos setup was easy.\\nControllable from your Android phone, tablet and Windows PC.  Not sure about control from Apple devices.\\nCons:\\nFor the price of the Connect box it should have much better DAC circuitry.\\nI agree with other reviewers who say the Sonos DAC circuitry in the Sonos Connect box sounds really bad so forget using the analog outputs on the Sonos connect box.  On the bright side, you can get good sound by connecting the Sonos Connect coaxial digital out port to a different DAC (or receiver/amp that accepts digital audio in).\\nI also agree with other reviewers who say there is a sound delay between your legacy wired speaker system and Sonos speakers which is probably caused by your home receiver/amp.  Bottom line: You won't want to use your wired speakers and Sonos speakers in the same room due to this aggravating delay unless you have a way to reduce the delay in your receiver/amp.\\nOn the bright side, if you place the Sonos speakers in a different room of the house far enough from the wired speakers you might not notice the delay...or it might give you an echo effect you like.  This is the case in my house.  Another thing that helps minimize the sound delay aggravation is the fact you can independently control the volume on the speakers in each room.\\nThe hardware combination below produced great sound:\\nSonos Connect with\\nOne (2 foot) Media Bridge ULTRA Digital Audio Coaxial Cable - see Amazon - inexpensive.\\nDenon ACR-2313CI receiver (circa 2012).\\nNo sound was produced until I used the Denon menu to 'assign' the Denon's digital audio input port to the Sonos Connect (by assigning it to the Denon CD input source).

They come with ample instructions and paring them with my iPhone 6 was a breeze.\\nWhat I like about them most of all is the sweat proofing.  I take a two mile walk everyday, rain or shine, and my head sweats like the proverbial pig!\\nI've had the fancy expensive no wire buds ($400) slip out unnoticed (I don't always listen to music and sometimes just use them for any phone calls) and go missing somewhere along a two mile trek never to be seen again.  So back to the wired ones where at least they'd slip out and hang there!  But all of them became slippery with the sweat from my exertions.  These do not.  They stay put and they don't feel moist and sticky when I touch them like the others.  So if you have that problem then look no further because here is your solution.\\n\\nThe funny thing is the sound is almost as good as the $400 ones which were totally wireless but these won't go missing (they have the clip that you can attach to the back of your shirt collar).  Now my problem is that I won't be able to use them much because I have new hearing aids that are bluetooth as well and answer the phone and stream music (of course they cost $3000.00  - so as far as I'm concerned they better do something besides just amplify sounds if I'm to justify that cost!!!).  So they're going to She who must be obeyed who takes her own walks and she was always borrowing them from me anyway and replacing the buds with ones that fit her (and then not putting mine back on of course!).  The buds come in three colors and they have inline controls that are easy to use.  They come with three sets of ear buds and 3 sets of rubber pieces that go before the ear buds and hold them in the ear, so your bound to find a combination that works for you.\\n\\nAll in all I was very satisfied with them and I thought the sound was very good indeed.  She who must be obeyed agrees with my assessment and she wears them on the treadmill and on her walks as well.\\n\\nI heartily recommend them because they are priced reasonably, are sweat proof and stay in place, and sound great!!!

I bought a second for upstairs thinking I would need one in the bedroom and I had another AP ready for the guest/media room.

I only need one upstairs, mounted on the master bed wall, and nothing else upstairs.  I'm returning the AC Lite I bought for the guest room, it isn't needed.\\n\\nI have them running thru a Ubiquity 8port POE switch.

The following review/testimonial is intended for those of you who are trying to take advantage of this new cost-saving opportunity.\\nLet's assume that we all prefer as little downtime as possible for our internet and TV. If you value your time you may not want to deal with some of the issues of bringing your own cable modem.\\n\\n1. BEWARE: to punish you for using your own modem the Cable Company (Optimum) may charge you a flat $80 for any follow up technician visits, whereas if you were renting theirs, the visit would be complimentary.\\n\\n2. BEWARE: The Cable Company configures its modems (in Optimum's case it would be an Arris as well) to match your level of service. When you use your own modem these configurations will not be in place. MAKE SURE YOU TEST THE SPEED BEFORE THE TECH LEAVES to spare you the DIY of calling Arris & the Cable Company and being bounced around on the phone trying to figure out why you are getting 28 mbps instead of the 200 mpbs you are paying for.\\n\\n3. COMPARE: The Cable Company's modem may in fact be fancier than this Arris. Their rental modem may handle higher speeds and more channels so that when and if you upgrade your are not maxed out. Is it better to have mode channels? you might want to know. This modem is not Arris's top-of-the-line.\\n\\n4. IN MY DEALING WITH ARRIS: I was very pleased with their customer service. They were ***U.S.-based*** and did a fantastic job for me. U.S.-based customer service—If you know the value of this . . . then you &lt;i>know&lt;/I> the value of this.

I bought this Kindle for my 89 year old aunt, who is losing her sight, after she told me how sad she is that she can barely read anymore. I took the kindle to her apartment, fully charged, and after we increased the font on the &#34;About your new kindle&#34; section, she was so excited that she could read it! I used her credit card to set up an account and tried to download a book that she was excited to read. The download didn't work. I tried a few things and ended up having to call customer service. The rep said that her account is &#34;under investigation&#34;. I asked how that could be when it was only set up five minutes before. They said I have to talk to an account person, but they couldn't transfer me. An account investigator will have to call my aunt and ask her questions and that would happen this evening. Do you have ANY idea how anxiety-producing that was for my aunt to hear?\\nAnyway, THEN, I was told that the device has to be updated with new software, and I need to connect it to a computer to do that. My aunt doesn't have a computer. So, I take it home with me to do the update, which I was told could be done while the account issue was being resolved. NOPE. I fooled around with it for an hour before calling Amazon AGAIN. That's when I heard all about the investigation again, but this time they told me that it could take 24-48 hours for the investigator to call my Aunt, because it's the weekend.\\nThis has been a total mess. I tried to do something special for my elderly relative, and now she can't sleep for worrying that her credit card is being investigated... and that she won't be reimbursed for the $9 she already spent on a book.\\nI can't tell you the amount of money I have spent on Amazon over years, but I am ready to throw this stupid, worthless Kindle out the nearest window, cancel my Prime account, delete the app from my phone and never visit the site again. THAT is how angry I am... I'm taking a deep breath until tomorrow (Monday) but if they can't get this done and my aunt loses any more sleep over this, I. Am.

I had never used Noctua products before, though I knew of their reputation, so I was unsure what to expect. Unfortunately, after a little less than a month, one of the five fans started creating excessive vibration and making a rhythmic hum (very audible). The pitch of the sound was too annoying to tolerate so I opened up the PC and narrowed it down to the specific offending fan. My assumption is something is wrong with the fan's axis/bearing because structurally the fan appeared to be fine. I looked up my order on Amazon and unfortunately my return window had expired. I ordered a replacement fan and installed it, no more vibration or noise, all good. I will update the review if I have further quality/longevity issues.\\n\\nPros:\\nVery robustly built, no cheap construction here.\\nAnti-vibration options are very nice, fan mounts and over-moldings on corners (front and back)\\nExtra wiring options provided with the fan are much appreciated.\\nThey deliver on noise suppression, I have five 140's running at 60% speed and I barely notice the machine.\\n\\nCons:\\nExpensive for a fan. ~$130 is a lot of money to spend on case fans...\\nBeige color maybe offputting (I don't mind it).\\n1 out of 6 fans was defective. Disappointed.\\n\\nOther Thoughts:\\nHopefully my one defective fan is an aberration. I'm willing to give Noctua the benefit of the doubt here because of their reputation, but the fact remains, it didn't take very long for one of them to go bad. Further annoyed I couldn't return it and had to purchase another one. Otherwise, I'm very pleased with their performance in my machine.\\n\\n**Edit** Upon reading other reviews, I realized Noctua has recently started having their products made in China. I checked all six of the boxes for my fans and all six were Made in China. I am not so confident now that my defective fan was an outlier, if Noctua is sending production out to China now to cut costs, it is not good. Even if they have good drawings from Noctua's engineering department, the Chinese do not manufacture products consistently within tolerance. Quality will suffer.","[]","B00CP6QLY6","B00CP6QLY6","AHB3PLZHYH7TZ7SSVOGIMMXOOWNA","2017-08-07 22:50:47.759","11","True","501"

I use it for internet access as well as reading and playing a few games.  It works fine for the games I play, so that that's good.  For reading it works ok too, but for whatever reason, it's very often slow to open the book so I can start reading.  It can take up to a full minute for the book's text to appear on the screen.  Once it's open, it reads just fine.\\n\\nFor accessing the internet it's often very frustrating!  Basically, it's slow.  When it's already slow AND you encounter a pop-up advertisement, guess what...  it's even slower.  It would be nice to have some kind of ad blocker, but I haven't found one. I suppose Amazon would miss out on some great advertising if ads got blocked.  I don't necessarily fault them for this, they just want to make money like any other business, but you'd think they could come up with something.\\n\\nI like to use Pinterest, but doing so on the kindle results in all kinds of mess. Websites won't load, websites get hung, screen won't respond to touch, slow performance, all kinds of junk I don't want to deal with.  After a short session on Pinterest I ALWAYS have to perform a reboot, sometimes even twice in order to get the thing to function properly.  I have used both the Pinterest app as well as using the Silk browser, and neither one works.  I know this is not all Kindle's fault, some lies with Pinterest too.  But if Pinterest is important to you, do not buy a Fire!\\n\\nAnother annoying thing is the material it's made with.  My last Fire had a nice soft coating that you could easily grip and felt comfortable in hand. I did not even need a case for it. This one is made of slick shiny plastic that is as smooth as the touch screen on the front.  I dropped the thing on the floor twice on the very first day I owned it because it is so slippery.  Super stupid design.\\n\\nI do still use this device daily, often.

"877647","3","Testing shows good 2M performance but not so much on 70cm","This is, in theory, a nice upgrade over the infamous NA-771. It's much more flexible and lighter and is supposed to deliver similar excellent performance. It's also supposed to be a big upgrade over something like the stock Baofeng UV-5R antenna which is only a small fraction of the length. But, either Btech is shipping fake clones (a VERY common problem with Nagoya antennas) or this antenna is could be better designed for use on 70cm (440 Mhz). I used a consistent set up with a quality VHF/UHF SWR meter and a small ground plane to simulate hand-held operation (hand-held testing is basically impossible with an SWR meter connected in-line). I measured the SWR of a bunch of different UV-5R compatible female SMA dual band antennas using the center of the transmit frequencies in the repeater portion of both bands.\\n\\nMy NA-24J had a near perfect 1:1 SWR on 2 meters. And, in using it, it hits more repeaters, by far, than the stock UV-5R antenna on 2 meters. But on 70cm it has nearly a 2:1 SWR and works about the same as the much shorter stock antenna which is disappointing as it's supposed to have significant gain on the 70cm band.\\n\\nBy comparison, a simple 1/4 wavelength telescopic antenna adjusted for a perfect 1:1 SWR on 2 meters is still close to 1:1 on 70cm where it's a 3/4 wavelength. The full 1/4 wavelength telescopic antenna delivers outstanding performance on both bands and it's only a few inches longer than the NA-24J antenna (but not flexible).\\n\\nThe NA-24J is a bit shorter than 1/4 wavelength at 2 meters so it presumably has a loading coil or other matching network in the base. That seems to work fine on 2 meters but not very well on 70cm. Either Nagoya did a poor job engineering this antenna or BTECH is shipping fake Chinese clones.\\n\\nIf you mainly want an antenna for 2 meters this one works great. If you're more interested in 70cm/440Mhz, the stock antenna performs roughly as well. If you use both bands this does have an advantage on 2m but it's A LOT longer than a typical stock rubber stubby antenna.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519wU-q2ZJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519wU-q2ZJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519wU-q2ZJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51QORCRLqtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51QORCRLqtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51QORCRLqtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WAQt3bbHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WAQt3bbHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WAQt3bbHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01H2HOKI6","B0BFM4362X","AGY7DVH6BSZWM735FPL7UK74Y57A","2017-08-05 23:47:00.095","4","True","501"
"646798","1","Much too sensitive - records almost continually.","Edit review after 4 months - This thing is useless. It records every tiny movement. The card is filled in less than 8 hours, sometimes as little as 4 hours. It is recording almost continually often 3 to 4 times a minute. If anything major ever happened, it would not be available because the card is filled with leaf flutters. There should be a setting for sensitivity. I would send this junk back if I could.\\n\\nOriginal Review - I'm not sure how this machine is going to work out. I ordered one and after trying everything, I could never get the light to come on. I finally returned the unit, received a replacement and got it charged and set up.\\n\\nThe second unit works fine but it has problems. The machine has no way to adjust sensitivity so raindrops, a leaf fluttering, or a car driving by several hundred feet away will set off the motion detector. But... sometimes it doesn't record even when the motion is close and active.\\n\\nCase in point - three days ago, the camera recorded 1,115 times that day even though I could find motion in only 5 of the videos. Sometimes it would record 6 times per minute. The next day, there was very little recorded (7 times). There are no videos of me spending 15 minutes sweeping the porch, cleaning the front door glass, and trimming some shrubs - all done within 8 to 15 ft. away from the camera in an area that usually records every move. Today the camera and floodlight worked perfectly.\\n\\nA couple of other points - I love the ease of plugging the camera into a USB port to look at the videos. It is so much easier than removing a SD card.  I don't like the location of the on/off switch. It is so close to the camera, you can not point the camera to the right without turning off the switch.\\n\\nI don't know what to expect of future use. The unit is fairly pricey and I am afraid that if I keep it, it will fail or be useless soon and I will have no recourse for returning the machine. I am leaning toward a return. I bought this Maxsa motion detector camera to replace a worn-out camera from a different manufacturer. I would buy another of the same model, but it is discontinued. I have a couple of weeks to decide what to do.","[]","B016D2OUFO","B016D2OUFO","AHZZUK5MYIIM2DGQJON6TTLHVV6A","2017-03-13 01:35:10.000","19","True","501"
"591454","4","ORBI is now a true mesh router system and daisy-chain capable.","On 9/12/17, new firmware (V2.0.0.72) was released-- making the ORBI line true mesh routers (meaning it is daisy-chain capable).\\n\\nThis NETGEAR ORBI system (RBK33) contains a router (RBR40, AC2200)\\ntwo wall plug satellites (RBS30), power adapter, and a 2m Ethernet cable.\\n\\nSetup is performed through a browser or Netgear app and is pretty easy if you have a little experience setting up a WiFi network.\\nThe units are pretty large, 6.4 x 3.3 x 8.0 in (Router), 3.3 x 3.0 x 6.34 in (Satellite).\\nI won't go into all the technical specs as they are readily available on Amazon or Netgear.com.\\n\\nI found that in our 3,500 sf. Home, we only needed one satellite to easily cover the whole house. I was going to use the second one to daisy-chain to a guest house about 130' linear away with walls and other obstructions. That did not work as well as planned. But, that is not what the ORBI is designed to do. It may work for that in a perfect environment but we needed a more directional extension or a high powered wireless bridge. So, for the intended design of the ORBI, it works quite well. Our signal strength is excellent and speed is much improved using multiple devices.\\n\\nWe have not had some of the frequent disconnects others have experienced. Our previous router/extender setup did not have any problems either so I wonder how much of that is due to environmental influences affecting the radio signals. The wall plug satellites do not have Ethernet ports, so if you need that go with the RBS50 or RBS40 satellites. They are interchangeable so the ORBI router will work with those as well.\\n\\nAs far as I know the RBK33 kit is only available at Amazon.

"505318","3","Good machine, but be ready to compromise.","This is a review of the computer as well as the overall experience.\\n\\nI've had it for a few days, and so far it works as you would expect. It is really fast, and I LOVE using dual 4K monitors. It is definitely faster than the i7-7700K as well.\\n\\nIt looks really nice and clean. I was planning on building one myself, but this one seemed to be a great compromise. I don't have to deal with cable management. It looks really neat.\\n\\nPreviously, I had the chance to use the 8080A model and had a branded 1080 Ti with a &#34;GeForce GTX 1080 Ti&#34; logo that would light up. It also had the other little lights shown on the picture. It looked great with the red fans.\\n\\nThe model I got, however, is the most generic one you could possible imagine. There are no extra lights other than the fans. The graphics card is plain black, and it's pretty much invisible.\\n\\nThe RAM sticks do not have any branding. Pretty much all generic. I contacted support to ask about the differences between the models and parts. I was told that they cannot guarantee consistency in the parts since they use whatever they have available. So, one person can get branded components, while others can get non-branded. Personally, I found that disappointing.\\n\\nThe Amazon page was also off. It stated that the computer had 6 x 3.1 USB ports and 2 x 2.0 ports. It doesn't. It only has 7 x 3.0 USB ports and a type-C USB port, which may be better for most people. There are no USB 2.0. I tried contacting support to ensure it was the right product and maybe just a mistake on Amazon's listing. When I called, Tier 1 had no clue, and I was transferred to tier 2 tech support where I was on hold for 57 minutes before I just hung up.\\n\\n If support is going to be like this the the next year, it probably won't be great. But, I will have to wait until I have to contact them for any other issues I might have.\\n\\nOverall, it's an OK machine that performs well for the price that I paid. Let's hope it holds up.","[]","B075VSBNQZ","B075VSBNQZ","AHSTKILHR44TI2L3IYSTMJW2VDPA","2017-11-13 21:08:12.954","137","True","501"

I spent HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON A COMPETITORS WIRELESS SECURITY CAMERA SYSTEM, swearing I will not be a victim again. And I still had to PLUG THEM IN, as they were permanently mounted, and was I was limited with still having to run electrical to power wires to power the competitor's cameras. With Arlo. They are truly completely wireless. You see? I have an unusual problem. I'm 52 years old and bought a home next to apartments, not knowing that I was going to have problems with trespassers cutting through my back yard. I'm trapped in my own home out of fear for my family, as well as myself. Waiting for a home invasion. Motion sensor lights don't scare the trespassers off. My home is like Fortress with weapons at every entrance, and lit up like a Christmas tree at night with blinking motion sensor lights. Not to mention, me constantly looking out the windows at every sound that I hear. I have an alarm system. But, visually being able to see the perpetrators with a simple  e-mail nonification because they had learned to bypass my existing cameras. I can place the Arlo cameras in strategically placed areas randomly where supplying power is  nonexistent. Especially in blind spots.. Arlo cameras also have a live button that allows you to see in real time. You have no idea of how much Arlo cameras have improved me emotionally from P.T.S.D. Which has has helped me physically. I had written my elderly relatives just last night in Ireland, explaining the health benefits with being able to monitor the elderly without disturbances in which that may be sleeping in which they may awake.  Allowing more freedom for the care giver with both using the motion sensing setting function or the live function. You would not believe the range that thes cameras have from the base unit. It's technology at its finest that has eased me emotionally which in turn helps me physically. There are silicone skins of many different covers for concealment, as many as mounting devices or stands that can aid in positioning in different areas. I LOVE MY ARLO CAMERAS!\\nEdit Review","[]","B00P7EVST6","B00P7EVST6","AHZA3EGWFLGWK5EU7BRJVGWJ36RQ","2017-02-01 16:11:07.000","12","True","501"
"417384","5","All I can really say is that I'm extremely happy with its performance with my V-MODA M100 headphones ...","There honestly isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said in professional reviews of this device. All I can really say is that I'm extremely happy with its performance with my V-MODA M100 headphones and that it can push them to nearly unbearable loudness at +6 gain (desktop, USB) while it'd probably blow the speakers at +12 gain. I found that +12 gain works very well when using this on-the-go (cheap MP3 player, aux) with my inexpensive in-ears as well as with the V-MODA M-100s.\\n\\nI haven't had a use for it yet, but I really appreciate the RCA to 3.5mm cable for only an added $1 compared to other sellers that don't include anything else. It's a great incentive from the seller to included a $10+ cable basically for free. The cable seems to be very good quality, but I don't know how its audio quality is. If I find I use for it I'll update this review for more information on the cable.\\n\\nEDIT: (May 21, 2017)\\n\\nBoth the DAC and amp are still functioning very well after almost daily use. The coating has handled itself well too as I still don't see any spots where bare material underneath is showing.\\n\\nI've used the amp alone quite a bit where I just don't have a USB port available and the amp really does make things louder and delivers more power to the lows. If you only want an amp though you'd probably be better off with something cheaper that isn't driven up in cost by an included DAC.\\n\\nThe cable sounds just as good as any of my 3.5mm male to male cables after testing it for a few hours.\\n\\nAs for compatability updates, I just recently upgraded my phone to a Samsung J3 2016 and to my surprise it's even louder per volume level as my laptop is. My Flac audio files sound great through the HF Player by Onkyo. One little quirk though is that for some reason audio and video plays in slow motion when running audio through the external USB DAC, but plays normally through the HF Player. I'm sure there's a solution for it, but I haven't found one yet.\\n\\nStill a 5/5 product.","[]","B00VET0NZ8","B00VET0NZ8","AFYO37ZNL7DTGKFURWEOOTHTALTA","2017-04-12 04:19:40.000","4","True","501"
"897609","5","Best Keyboard for the Price","I went from a Corsair STRAFE with Cherry MX Blue's to this keyboard.\\n\\nFirstly, this keyboard is amazingly cheap. I think I paid less than $30 for it. So it isn't going to be perfect by any means, but it's still pretty good.\\n\\nI've been using this keyboard for over a month now and I'm loving the more compact 60% board. The Outemu blue feel almost no different from the Cherry MX keys - they are missing a small amount of &#34;crispness&#34; when they actuate but it's something you get used to pretty quickly.\\n\\nThe LED's are not rgb as each line has it's own set of one color LED lights. They are probably the brightest LED's I've had on a keyboard and I do wish there was a way to lower the intensity while keeping the lights on. The keyboard also has some connectivity issues where the LED's will stay on but it won't type anything. This can easily be fixed by just unplugging the keyboard and plugging it back in. Though a bit annoying, you can't really complain with a keyboard this cheap.\\n\\nOne of the major things that surprised me with this board was just how solid it is. The backing is your standard ABS plastic, and the keycaps aren't perfect(I haven't any wear though in a month, they just don't feel just right.) This is all understandable for a keyboard of this price point. What confused me was that the face plate is wonderfully brushed aluminum. It get's dirty easily but it adds some solid weight and a beautiful look to the keyboard. One last little complaint I have is that the cable is just a standard cable. If I had a choice, I would have gone with a braided cable, just for the aesthetics. Again, not a real issue with the keyboard.\\n\\nOverall, I love this keyboard. It has worked fantastically and is a perfect entry keyboard for someone who is just entering the space. Though the lack of Cherry MX keys was a bit disappointing at first, I quickly realized that if I continued with keyboard and got into custom builds that the majority of the switches used in those boards are either Gateron's or Outemus. If you want a solid, coloring keyboard that goes with a modern setup, I'd go with this one.","[]","B010SPN1HU","B010SPN1HU","AHFII5HZGSSM6QZJUP3GJWQDMSFQ","2017-02-12 19:15:39.000","0","True","501"
"35736","1","BUYERS BEWARE !!!","I purchased this unit in December, 2016. I got it to replace a 10 year old Logitech wired surround system that I had run the surround sound speaker wires under the floor into the basement and back up through the floor to their position behind my couch for viewing my television, DVD, player, PS3, etc.\\nWhen I ordered this unit, with its supposed wireless rear surround sound speakers, I pulled the wires from under the floor. BIG mistake on my part.\\nAfter the arrival of my VIZIO SB4051-D Smartcast 40&#34; 5.1 Slim Sound etc., I followed their set instructions and the unit worked fine for the first 2 minutes. Then the sound from one of the rear speakers quit and then both went out. After repeatedly re-pairing the the soundbar and the subwoofer, I could never get the speakers to stay on, although sometimes you could hear a &#34;muffled&#34; sound coming from one or both of the rear speakers.\\nAfter several hours of frustration, I called Vizio support and related my experience/difficulties to them. They had me repeat several things I had already done and then concluded that it must be a bad unit. They sent me a whole new unit and prepaid labels to return the first one.\\nTo make a long story longer, when the second one arrived, I got the same results as the first, making me think, I must be the problem. So I once again called the Vizio support unit and explained my situation. They had me go through the steps to pair the rear speakers(which were the same as what I had done many times for #1 unit and #2). No difference in performance.\\nThey once again said to try another unit so they sent me an entirely different one, etc. The next one (#3) is still here and did the same thing, but I got tired of trying to resolve it.\\nI reran the wires under my floor and replaced my Logitech 5500 for my main TV. This Vizio soundbar is now being used for my basement TV and works well, but the subwoofer and rear speakers are gathering dust in the garage where their useless units belong.\\nAlthough the soundbar itself works fine, if you're looking for a complete surround system, look elsewhere and don't waste your money, time and efforts on this unit.","[]","B01G3STJD6","B01G3STJD6","AFPVQQAO34YX2AEOAKORMGK7FVAQ","2017-08-13 18:16:11.946","4","True","501"
"692452","5","It has one job and it does it well","Overall, I am quite pleased with this laptop bag; the pros and cons are a mix of both cosmetic and functional design resulting in an overall rating of 4.5/5 but rounded up to 5.\\n\\nPros: The color is exactly, if not better, than what is shown.  The gray has a perfectly balanced white weft and weave appearance almost similar to chambray but the material is sturdy without being coarse/rough.  The green is a lovely, bright sea green as pictured. Truly spot on photography.\\nThus far, the zippers and seams appear to be well constructed and of solid quality.\\nThe padding on the straps and back panel help for a comfortable fit even when I had it loaded to the fullest, and even the small handle is nicely padded.  The straps adjusted easily, even while on, and didn't slip out of place once fully weighted and worn.\\n\\nCons: The pockets, while numerous, are my primary complaint either due to placement and/or design.  The front flap is a pocket but seems to serve no function other than for aesthetics which I personally find bothersome because it's natural to lift the flap of a rucksack to access the primary compartment but what you get is a slightly bigger pocket. The side pockets are useful for storing items like a wireless mouse or phone chargers. I frequently forget about the bottom zippered compartment because of its small size and location but it holds my also forgotten about pencils that I ultimately end up searching for in all of the other compartments.\\n\\nNeither a con nor a pro - the main compartment:  I have a large laptop, 17.3&#34;, and it takes up every inch of the space available for it.  I can also squeeze in my keyboard, and charger as well as a large cooling fan.  Not much else so If I need notebooks then something has to stay back and the choice depends on where I'm working and what I'm working on.  I chose this size to help ensure that it would still meet Air Carrier carry-on size requirements and knew I may have to sacrifice a piece of equipment.  If this gives you an idea of capacity.\\n\\nThe bag is well made, matches its description, and is quite functional despite my own personal preferences.

"325747","4","That fan is super strong, and capable of moving quite a bit ...","The SP20 Jacksion is my first &#34;professional&#34; attempt at a miner. Purchased off of ebay, I also picked up some Gigampz (used) as well, and combined one with one used DPS-800-GB A 1000w Server Power Supply. System works well, I do under clock though at around 1.2TH/s. I also ran this unit on my Corasir 750w power supply with the same clocking. You can see that the manufacturer put a lot of thought into the build, and even the use of their simple web page, and or SSH terminal. Literally takes a few moments to setup from scratch and it's mining for you. According to &#34;slushpool&#34; I'll be making my first payout (of around 24-28 bucks) within 2.5 weeks, and yearly it shows me making about 511 bucks. Of course this is not including power usage costs, though I'm goal is to keep that to a minimum as much as possible. Sound, yea -- I'd call it loud.. That fan is super strong, and capable of moving quite a bit of air. I have it running in the room next to me. My apartment is two stories, and the bedrooms are downstairs. This isnt much of an issue during the day, as I'm upstairs. At night, I use my trusty white noise generator -- an room air cleaner, so I dont hear it anyhow. However I doubt I'd want it in the same room as me. If I can get some extra scratch, I'd like to invest in a Antminer S9, but we'll see. For now, this thing is working well.  I'd recommend under clocking it, no need to push much beyond 1.2TH/s anyhow. Your just going to use more power, generate more heat, with marginal performance increases. Really, the usage comes down to the performance of the power supply. I noticed that in comparing the results of the Corsair 750HX unit running the SP20, vs this HP DPS-800. The corsair was mildly warm during operation, where the DPS-800 is pushing a bit of hot air with it's little fans.The case is fairly warm as well. Keep in mind the Corsair has no internal fan, so that should give you an idea of the quality of a good power supply.","[]","B00RC288E4","B00RC288E4","AEIT6OW5WSFLWAMVKT42V6AWYZCA","2017-06-13 03:33:19.810","0","False","501"
"680905","3","Great Idea, But needs some improvement","Just received the unit a little bit ago, and set it up immediately. Following are my initial thoughts…\\n\\nIt was very easy to setup, but I initially had a bit of an issue connecting to WIFI. Not exactly sure why, as I made certain that the signal is very good in the spot I picked. I moved it to another spot with a slightly weaker signal, and it connected immediately. Go figure. Once it connected, all went smoothly.\\n\\nIt works exactly as advertised, but now that I actually have it, I wonder about a few things:\\n\\nAll 8 of my Echos blare an incoming call announcement. There should be some way of just using lights, or a lower volume directly as it relates to phone calls, as my landline also rings (and is obviously what I’m used to). Receiving a phone call sets the entire house into a sonic battle of notifications. Maybe even a way to turn off the Connect, or put it into a state of pause for times when one doesn’t need to have the use of all Echos.\\n\\nIn addition, there should be some way to eliminate a specific Echo from a list of available answering devices, like we can in groups and multi-room music. I don’t need all of the Echos to be available to answer the phone, nor do I want to hear them all announce a call.\\nThere also needs to be some way of accessing a keypad in order to punch in a number for calls that require one. Picking up the landline during an Echo call and trying to punch a number didn’t work.\\n\\nAs an aside, I received a call from Amazon customer service regarding a problem that I had with my Echo 2nd. The agent said that she couldn’t hear me, so I had to pick up the landline phone in order to communicate. Oops.\\n\\nThat said, and for the money, it’s worth the investment as long as you have a landline and the requisite Echo(s), although I wish a bit more thought had been put into the actual real-world use of this device. I would expect that updates will address some, if not all of the basic requests that are indicated above, as Amazon is pretty good at such things.","[]","B074TTVQYP","B077D5MC5M","AFZUINZY7AALHJ3YYHZP6PODWWJA","2017-12-20 20:25:08.949","602","True","501"
"774058","5","HS-400S- Patience-It's a Stretch at First But Well Worth The Effort!!","As it's been said by others, -there are several positives getting this modification done, but it's well worth the effort. No more itchy pads These are far more comfortable than the stock pads and the Focus pads. Whatever it is, perhaps the distance from the driver, the bass is enhanced but not unnaturally so. Slightly, but still an audiophile signature. I would still call it a neutral sound but now where the musician played the bass, you hear it. It is meant to be- not totally flat. The sound signature is also more open. I wear these with the narrow side in the front and wider side toward the back as I saw on a You Tube review. Easy Search.\\n\\nLastly the comfort is far superior to the original. They look good, they feel good and most importantly they sound terrific. It's not a total makeover by any means. The stock  HS-400S sound great. However for that extra oomph of bass, comfort and an airy wide sound stage, these really do the trick. Absolutely great.\\n\\nYour additional investment in time and money. How do you do this:\\nIf you want to keep your original pads you will need to buy the $20 leather replacement pads from Hifiman as well as the Brainwavz. The rings are removable from the leather pads.  Or you could literally tear them off the stock pads, but that is your call. If you buy the leather pads, you  simply remove the inner hard plastic rings that clips onto the earphones.\\n\\nYou then insert the ring very slowly stretching the oval Brainwavz ear pads with the circular Hifiman clips. Check the video on You Tube which is easily found. Proceed slowly, be patient and stretch the pads (at your own risk.) It definitely can be done- see the photos below. You may hate me while your are doing the process but if you go slowly and carefully inserting around the pad, it with stretch and fit. It will look odd at first but an hour later it will look like it came with the unit.\\n\\nGood luck- when you are done, I can't imagine you will regret this terrific and not so difficult modification that takes a great set of headphones and puts them over the top. If you invested the $20 in the leather pads, you can always go back- I doubt you will.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N+vgxzx8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N+vgxzx8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N+vgxzx8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hQ7+C+H4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hQ7+C+H4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hQ7+C+H4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718HFEFdDLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718HFEFdDLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718HFEFdDLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uim3f9E2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uim3f9E2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uim3f9E2L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vcVBkGnNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vcVBkGnNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vcVBkGnNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00ZY8PGJI","B01G567T9C","AE6LJLMUAM6NEHJ3KSYCSMZLH42A","2017-07-10 23:47:00.533","6","True","501"

Image stabilization is great for photo shooting at shutter speeds close to 1&#34; AND for video it's AMAZING. Hand holding with this is unreal - it's so steady even extended out to 200mm.\\n\\nLook and feel is very solid and pro level. Shows fingerprints just a little more on the barrel from use.\\n\\n77mm diameter for lens caps and filters (great for fitting with most other higher end lenses)\\n\\nThe hood is maybe my biggest gripe in how plastic and bendable it is - but it's the lens hood. It's not designed to be cast iron and unbreakable.\\n\\nZoom ring is up front, and it is a change from nikkor glass, but it's a non- issue as muscle memory will adapt to the change.\\n\\nZoom is quick and accurate.\\n\\nArca-Swiss plate as the collar mount is genius. Everyone will be doing this eventually.\\n\\nIt seems as if light is metered into the camera at just a little bit higher of a stop with help of the electronic diaphragm. Which means lower ISO and just a little easier time in low light.\\n\\nGreat bokeh, and sharp from center to edge with non existent distortion.\\n\\nFocus breathing will be the &#34;issue&#34; you will hear about this lens the most.

Take the time to understand the switches on the side. There's a lot going on inside the internal components with a lens like this.

At first I thought it was maybe signal interference but no matter how close the speaker and Echo was placed it would still have the issue. I contacted customer service and they were prompt to reply offer assistance but after reading so many negative reviews on this common occurrence on Bluetooth connection issues as well as the unit breaking down after few weeks/months of use I do not want to deal with the hassle of getting a replacement unit. It is unfortunate as I thought I had found a quality speaker that looks great with 4.0 Bluetooth specs.\\n\\n9/18/17 FOLLOW UP REVIEW:\\n\\nSince my last review, Archeer has definitely stepped up in allowing me to return my first purchase due to my issues. Later on I received an email stating that they received another batch of speakers with improved Bluetooth connection specs. So I gave it another shot and reordered this speaker... It was working fine with my Amazon Echo Dot device for about a 2 months. Then yesterday the issue happened again when using the speakers through my Amazon Echo. I have uploaded a video of what has been happening with the connection going in and out throughout the use randomly. I have tried resetting the speaker and reconnecting it to my Echo, also have tried rebooting my router and internet connection with no luck. I'm not sure why this is happening, does anyone else have this issue with their Archeer speaker and Amazon Echo Dot device?\\n\\n11/6/17 FOLLOW UP REVIEW:\\nIt turns out the problem was the Amazon Echo device I had been using. After replacing the device I have not had any issues for about a month now (keeping fingers crossed). That being said I had raised the star level to a 4 rating, also Archeer customer service has been keeping in touch periodically to check to see if my speaker was still functioning as it should be. With all the products out there in the world it is quite rare to receive such level of customer service and follow ups. I would recommend this speaker to anyone who is looking for in home or outdoor use.","[]","B01HLSMVTQ","B01HLSMVTQ","AEADNHYDG3OETMIBU443ORFB54WA","2017-07-31 13:53:06.455","4","True","501"

I own a Haier mini-fridge that works very well; I guess that trust led me to try this TV.  Considering the price ($380 with shipping): I got the better part of the deal!\\n\\nPros:\\n-Very bright!  I had to turn the brightness down below 50% because the back-light was way too bright, (which the opposite is usually the problem!)  I consider that a major pro.\\n-4k, you got it.  I tried it out on a blu-ray and I've never seen such fluid motion.\\n-Remote is very friendly, has a comfortable and good quality feel; it's not a cheap feather-weight remote with clunky buttons like my Sanyo and Vizio.  In addition, the menu options are very convenient, all the settings you would want to have available to customize.\\n-TV is very light-weight.  I carried it myself rather easily up a flight of stairs, and I'm not Superman!\\n\\nCons:\\n-Sound quality could be better.  I really can't complain though, it's comparable to every flatscreen I've ever owned (more than a dozen over 10 years).  I think I'm spoiled having a PC with dolby digital surround system on another TV, that bass shakes the floor.  I ended up buying a $60 Soundpal soundbar:  it works decent, not great, not bad, I guess if you want that booming bass and crystal clear treble you have to go for the $600 soundbars.\\n\\nHonestly, that's the only con I can come up with.

"139673","5","Fantastic earbuds at a great price.","I've been using these for a month now as a replacement for my SBH80 model (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DZTJKYU/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_53) that died after one year of use.\\n\\nIn that time, I've found that I actually prefer these to the SBH80 which cost twice as much.\\n\\nThe sound is comparable, though these are a liiiittle bit heavy on the bass side at first - break them in and the sound level balances out quite nicely with a rich overall profile.\\nI find these to be more comfortable than the SBH80 as well; the SBH80 had a tendency to slide across your neck, leaving the large central unit dangling off to one side, which was annoying.\\nThe silicone band used in this model is super lightweight and comfortable, and it nice not to have that larger plastic unit draped across the back of your neck.\\nThe earbuds are very light and comfortable, and you're provided with 6 silicone tips of varying sizes - the buds are also compatible with Comply foam tips as well.\\n\\nThe controls are intuitive, with raised +, -, and power buttons, with the + and - buttons used as volume control with a click, and skipping tracks forward and backward if you hold the button down for 2 seconds. The power button also doubles as the call button, operating on the same system as the volume; click to take a call or hang up, and hold to power on or off.\\n\\nI was also pleasantly surprised by the vocal alerts from the unit, as it clearly says 'Power On', 'Power Off', and 'Bluetooth Connected' when engaging those different functions.\\n\\nMy only real concern with the MDRXB70BT/B is the very slim profile of the wires that lead to the earbuds, I could see them getting snagged on something and snapping off, or just wearing out over time. Granted, those are speculative worries, but it's something to remain conscious of.\\n\\nOverall I'm very impressed with these earbuds, especially considering the price - I hope they last longer than my SBH80 earbuds did, because the value present with this unit is quite incredible indeed.","[]","B072WCWDZZ","B072WCWDZZ","AGS2MAKLFOTNOSB3YYOF7L342FHQ","2017-07-25 17:28:56.639","4","True","501"
"984800","5","Big fan of Anker, great screen protectors!","I'm a big fan of Anker products, I've had a lot of success with them, until this. I have installed numerous glass screen protectors for my family's iPhones over the years, and discovered how nice Anker's were. I've installed the Anker protectors on a 5s, 6, and 7. I recently upgraded my 6 to an iPhone 8. I had an extra screen protector from a 2 pack I purchased for my wife's iPhone 7 (which went on with zero trouble and remains completely on to this day!). I read that these screen protectors would fit not only the iPhone 7, but the 8 as well. When I installed it, the right side of the protector wouldn't adhere. I've seen this on a lot of people's phones, but never had trouble with it myself. It really didn't bother me too much, but I was worried debris would get under and it would continue to lift and crack, so I found these for well under $10, no questions asked, I purchased them. Now, I'm having trouble with both sides. Both installations are spot on, the hinge system Anker provides is pretty foolproof, I can get the protector any more centered, it's dead on, yet both sides are lifting. I haven't tried the third one, I would suspect the same.  Either the iPhone 8's screen starts to curve ever so slightly sooner than the other's or Anker's product is suffering from quality control issues. Putting these things on takes time and work to make sure nothing is under them and they are centered. I don't know what is happening that is causing the problem, like I said, not my first rodeo, and all my other installs are perfect and stuck down like I would expect.\\n\\nJust an update, Anker's support team reached out to me and helped me very quickly. There must've been something wrong with the adhesive or something. They sent me a replacement right away and the new protector went on without any problems (I even had to lift it off, remove a little spec of dust stuck under the protector and reapply). All the sides have adhered and have remained down so far. I've found that these screen protectors from Anker have worked out very well with all my iPhones and are some of the easiest to apply. With the prices they offer them at, you simply can't beat it, and Anker's support was amazing.","[]","B01MQV6QL8","B01MQV6QL8","AF43BDR6UFW2KL5JJC3ZP2N6G5AA","2017-09-25 17:37:25.887","0","True","501"
"149946","2","Love/Hate","I love....and hate this player! Sure, like everyone says, it sounds fantastic. Smooth, non fatiguing, black back ground, nice layers and tons of detail for a product like this. An absolute pleasure to listen to with hifi head phones and hires files. On the listenability scale I'd give this a 9 out of 10. But, MY GAWD! the UI and software are terrible. It's unintuitive and laggy and features are very limited. Loading files from a mac is easy enough, I suppose, but once it's in the player I'm missing lots of album art (my android smart phones don't miss any, btw). I only have about 30g of files on this thing and I haven't even loaded a micro sd card yet. Christ on a cracker! just how laggy would it get if I loaded 128g+ on this thing?!?!?! Scrolling is awful and I often have to wait for the system to catch up when pressing touch screen buttons. What would other wise be a phenomenal music experience is diminished by crappy UI and weak laggy software, sheesh!. C'om manufactures of hi res players (all o' yous', listen up), it's 2017 and there is no earthly reason for laggy software and crappy UI....no matter the price point. Speaking of diminishing the experience (Astell and Kern), what were you thinking when you designed the (otherwise beautiful) body with razor sharp edges. This is so uncomfortable hold (/caress/love), whatever. :) It's almost as though you want people to love and hate it at the same time. I'm gonna keep the dad gum thing just cause it sounds so good (dependent on having hires files and nice cans). I'm just gonna set it on shuffle and duck tape the sharp edges and enjoy the sweet music. YMMV :-)))\\nEDIT/UPDATE: Just discovered that the AK jr's USB DAC function wouldn't work on either of my desktop macs. The mac sees the AK JR and the Pure Music software sees it also. The AK Jr in USB DAC mode just won't cooperate. Maybe defective, I dunno. I have two other dacs on hand and they work just fine. I'm lowering my rating from 3 to 2 for this one. I'm returning this one and probably won't even consider another DAP until manufactures of these devices get there act together regarding UI and software.","[]","B00XNME0GC","B00XNME0GC","AGJOKEUEHOJSCJWK2KVRPYMQMQMQ","2017-03-18 20:43:32.000","16","True","501"
"312821","4","Good design for laptop users, poor design for desktop use.","UPDATED REVIEW***\\n\\nFull disclosure. I admit to not paying enough attention to the product image or description.\\n\\nSimply speaking, I didn't believe the photo was right. I mean who on earth would make a USB hub with a 6&#34; cable? With so many product images being heavily Photoshopped, and images on Amazon not being of the actual item being sold, it is VERY hard to tell for sure what you are getting.\\n\\nFor use with desktop computers, this thing is very difficult to useIn order to actually get the ports anywhere useful, you have to add a USB 3.0 a/b cable. Which is an added expense. Desktops typically have the USB 3.0 ports on the back of the system. And stuffed in a desk, meaning to plug / unplug anything from the hub, you need to drag your computer out from under your desk to make the connection. Just not my idea of fun.\\n\\nFor my laptop use it's a different story.\\n\\nI can use my USB hard drive, as well as my USB KVM cable where the cable actually reaches. Sadly on my laptop, the video port is on the side with the sole USB 3.0 port.\\n\\nThe manufacturer / vendor has contacted me in regards to the cable issue, and appears to be very receptive to product input from customers, for which I am very grateful. This will serve them well in their business for years to come!\\n\\nThe short cable issue aside, this has been a great little USB 3.0 hub. Disk performance using this is fine. No real problems. I can transfer data from my phone, to my external hard drive. No lags even when editing video.\\n\\nThe form factor is quite small, and compact, again a great feature for your laptop bag, and not too bad for desktop use.\\n\\nMaterials seem to be pretty much industry standard plastics, PVC, and metal etc... Nothing too shabby, nothing too fancy. Certainly no bling to brag about but that isn't what a USB hub is for anyway.\\n\\nAll in all, I think I am going to get a different hub for my desktop application, and stash this one in my laptop bag where it is an ideal fit.","[]","B00XMD7KPU","B0C2P7CNWG","AHCHW2CQHUSBPPNXHFE4RPGIXXDA","2017-10-16 05:37:11.914","1","True","501"

Even if you set another VLAN to be untagged on a given port, you cannot then remove VLAN 1 from that port.&#34;\\n\\nThis is a huge issue because if you wish to segment sections of VLANs using a &#34;router on a stick&#34; implementation, you can set the PVID on a port to be a VLAN other than VLAN1, but then broadcasts received on another port in VLAN1 are allowed to propagate out of all ports.\\n\\nAnother Amazon reviewer, putzomaticon, sheds some light on this issue when he wrote TP-Link support on May 28, 2015: &#34;I contacted TP-Link support regarding this issue and they basically told me they implemented these features this way on purpose because this model switch is apparently targeted at end users that want these features, but don't know anything about them. Here is a quote from their response: &#34;For your first advice about no management vlan of TL-SG1016DE,it is not the oversight, it is due to consideration of small business environment, where most users do not have enough network knowledge,they know little about the concept of &#34;management vlan&#34; and they do not have so much concern about the security problem caused.&#34;&#34;\\n\\nNetwork admins in a small business environments suddenly don't care about network security? This is a huge security concern because you're unable to adjust the management VLAN and the management IP address is accessible for every VLAN on the switch through VLAN1 regardless of the configuration. Truly a horrible and insecure implementation.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ILXLf5nqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ILXLf5nqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ILXLf5nqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J8Jr3GN8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J8Jr3GN8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J8Jr3GN8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B00K4DS5KU","B0BZLBL1L9","AE54WZPULC65A5COWGSRBDFDOWPQ","2017-01-14 18:32:30.000","498","True","501"

Seriously! How hard is it to create a step by step guide to setup the device? Their website indicates: The versatile YubiKey does not require software installation or a battery; just plug it into a USB port, and touch the button for secure and strong authentication. Very misleading, you must configure it and that requires some software which is not included on the device.\\n\\nI've set the device aside for now, when I feel I have a few hours to waste I'll try to make sense of their documentation. Would I recommend the device? In theory it sounds great and security is absolutely essential these days, but if they can't even document their product in a manner that is even semi-user friendly I find it difficult to have many positive thoughts about it. Perhaps after I have time to spend a few hours going through their website I might change my mind, but for now I say run the other way","[]","B018Y1XXT6","B018Y1XXT6","AEPVY4HI5MLNGAVN6RSASIDYTECQ","2017-04-09 01:59:32.000","3","True","501"
"483350","3","Bought this for the Optoma GT1080, worked great initially...","12/15/17 Edit:\\n\\nSadly, it started to display some odd visual irregularities in the picture that I could never quite figure out. Also noticed one of the color slices, the yellow, was about 25% bigger than the OEM one, which required some color tweaking to fix. Ultimately, had to return it.\\n---------------------------\\n\\nOriginal review:\\n\\nAs many others have experienced, over time, our projector color wheel becomes loud, due to the bearing starting to fail and/or the picture just goes to crap, usually because the colors on the wheel itself, start to fade. Decided to give replacing it myself a go. Ended up with this color wheel and it worked perfectly on my Optoma GT1080 (non Darbee)... but after some trial and error.\\n\\nA few key points for install.\\n\\n1. Absolutely remove the lamp housing screws! Now I didn't have to detach every cable, (just the color wheel connector itself) but there were a total of 7 screws I had to remove in order to lift up the housing just enough, to be able to easily slide in and out the color wheel. DO NOT try to install the color wheel with the housing still bolted down... you can kind of do it at an angle, but it puts pressure on the glass and will likely result in it breaking.\\n\\n2. Initially my color wheel, once fully installed, would not spin freely. Upon taking it back apart and comparing it with the old color wheel, I notice little rubber feet still attached to my old color wheel that adds maybe a millimeter of space between the wheel and the housing it screws onto. Putting the feet back on the new color wheel and adjusting the screw tightness appropriately, (you'll have to play with how tight each screw is) solved my initial problem and it was able to spin freely again. Basically, once you put the new color wheel back in its housing... give it a quick spin. If it spins freely, you're likely good to go.\\n\\n3. When putting it all back together w/ the lamp housing, be very patient and go slow. The possibility here to break the new color wheel still exists.\\n\\nAll in all, my projector is now whisper quiet and the picture is fantastic... as good as it was brand new.","[]","B075D9N3BF","B075D9N3BF","AEOXFQZX7HIHDUE6IMHP73HHDB2Q","2017-12-05 19:21:00.805","1","True","501"
"644764","5","Absolute Best Bang For Your Buck in TVs Right Now.","Now that this set is around $3700, it is the best value in high end displays.\\n\\nSo I just got this one delivered from ABT last week and all I can say is, I am so glad I didn't go with OLED.\\n\\nIf I could have justified the cost of the nearly $9000 the Sony Z9D costs, that would be the only model I would choose over this. But as it is, the full backlighting with local dimming on the XBR75X940D is nothing short of amazing, and watching 4K OLED demo material on this makes for the most amazing inky black levels I have ever seen on any non-OLED set, while maintaining a contrast ratio that can still deliver more vivid colors and detail in shadows than OLED, which makes this set look far better than OLED in my opinion.\\n\\nOut of the box the settings are so close, it's the closest to a calibrated TV I have ever seen pre-calibration, much less owned. After calibration it is nothing short of stunning.\\n\\nMatched with a Samsung UBD-K8500 and 2017 nVidia Shield it excels with any and all content I throw at it. Making all 1080P content, as well as 4K HDR and 4K non-HDR content look amazing.\\n\\nI'm running it with a Denon x2200w for my surround sound.\\n\\nNo noticeable ghosting for me with regular content. No flashlighting. No globs of grey. Great uniformity in light, grey and dark screens. Just inky blacks and vivid colors. Side viewing is as expected for this type of panel. Not the best, but I've seen much worse. But I'm an AV fanatic and am always sitting in the sweet spot so I don't care about side viewing that much. But it is better than most side lit LEDs I've seen or owned.\\n\\nMy verdict: After a year of comparisons in 4K displays, this one is the absolute best for the money you can get right now.

If they are for day time use they are pretty good to not bad at all . I have looked through expensive binoculars in the past so I can imediately see the optical flaws durring the day there is a blue soft halo cast in the eypieces about 60 % of the way out , they are pretty sharp and contrast is marginal . The image they made seemed kinda flat for binoculars others I have, make awesome 3D like images  . Remeber these are not 300.00 binoculars they are 65 bucks so they will not be perfect . For astronomy they are not good the left tube has severe sphereical abberations and does not focus light to a single pin point of any kind sharp spikes on bright objects  . The right tube was better but not by much for astronomy they are not so good and they are kinda dim for stars. I saw M31 a large galaxy and did find a dimmer galaxy i could not identify as well . The double cluster looked ok as well but not amazing and needed to look at it with averted vison on a half phase moon . For double stars they were not bad . One thing I noticed in these binoculars is the lack of colors of star light. There was no blue stars and orange stars all the stars were white or off white. The coatings were really great on the lenses . They had ok eyerelief Idont  think these are what the actual eyerelief is . I wear glasses when observing and found them to be kinda hard to look through. I was always serching for the sweet spot and could never seem to stay on the spot . They were aligned well did not get the sea sick feeling or have to move my eyes around much to compensate . Over all for 65 bucks they are better than department store binoculars but not as good if you were to spend 50 bucks more in cash , for 65 bucks they are exactly what you pay for . I also found them to feel pretty heavy .\\nFor casual night time use they will do ok . For good day time use they are great. I would not depend on my life with these but for bird watching ,or just to have a quality pair of binoculars around they are pretty good rember these are 65 bucks not 300 if you need a good pair that can do alot these are pretty good .","[]","B00CM2NQWI","B00CM2NQWI","AETGMZ2ZWOVJRWXZEYKPNWMAOM4A","2017-09-04 20:35:12.265","0","True","501"
"947048","5","Wears well and protects my tablet.","This is my second Tab A 8 ProCase.  After over a year of very hard and constant use of the first case, the outer layer of its polyurethane &#34;leather&#34; material along the &#34;spine&#34; started to crack and flake a bit.  I've had other cases from other manufacturers for other tablets and none have lasted this long with the constant use I give it.  I just put some heavy black duct tape on the spine to fix up the cosmetic appearance and all was well again.  I use the elastic loop to retain a combo stylus/pen (one comes with case, replacements are available online from several sources) and the loop eventually got ragged and stretched out enough that I figured it was time for a replacement.\\n\\nThe multi-position stand works well for me and I like this folio type case as it both protects the screen and magnetically turns the tablet off when the case is closed.\\n\\nMy only complaint with my original case was that the placement of the elastic stylus loop caused the stylus to get in the way of the right side controls.  They've now improved this by moving the location of the elastic loop downward, giving better access to the controls.\\n\\n(Edited to repair typos)\\n\\n[A year later]  This case is still going strong despite heavy daily use.  Little wear is evident - just a little loss of black color at the corners of the hinge which is easily covered with a black marker. Only problem, as before, is that the elastic loop stretched out and would not keep the pen in place unless the pocket clip on the pen was engaged in the loop.  I just took a needle and black thread and stitched the loop in half (from end looks like a figure 8).  The resulting inner loop again holds the stylus as intended.\\n\\n[One more update]  Well. Eventually this case finally got so worn that I had to replace it.  The case still functioned perfectly, but the thin urethane skin started peeling off its fabric backing and it had to go.  But this was after giving it hard daily use for a LONG time, much longer than other cases I've had with previous tablets.  This time I went for a brown one to get a different look.","[]","B00YG1FM8O","B01ITOFEX6","AE7FSX6L5TDFD2I2KHT2LCEDTCZA","2017-06-15 22:23:25.141","2","True","501"
"988793","5","Helped Our Son Be A Safer Driver","We purchased the TP-006 Aviators Color Blind Glasses for our son who is red-green colorblind as a test to see if he would benefit from more expensive options like a red filter contact or the more famous color blind glasses that are $250+.\\n\\nFirst off, let's clear some misconceptions.  These glasses do not allow a person to see missing colors like a non-colorblind person.  These glasses instead help shift the contrasts of colors that look the same to have more or less contrast so the person can distinguish them better from other colors that normally look identical.  In fact, when my son put them on he at first didn't really notice any difference.  It wasn't until he started noticing some items around the house and outside that now looked different that he was able to appreciate the effect.  For instance certain shades of yellow now &#34;pop&#34; (his words).  He is now able to notice yellow caution road signs.  He is now able to see the yellow stripes on the road.  He can now detect if a traffic light is red, yellow, or green from much farther away.  He is able to correctly identify a couple more targets in the colorblind test.\\n\\nThese glasses are dark like sunglasses so using them inside or during cloudy or evening conditions outside is difficult.  The side of the lens that you and I would see has an iridescent mirror-like hue.  The side of the lens the wearer looks through gives the world a pinkish hue with a sunglasses effect.  It reminds me of looking through a blank frame of developed 35mm film.  The fit is similar to any aviator sunglasses you would find at a big box store.  It came with a nice storage case and the build seems to be comparable to a normal pair of sunglasses.\\n\\nI'm rating this as 5 stars because of the value vs. the competitive product ($70 vs. $299) and it does what it is intended to do which is to allow a color blind person to distinguish between a few more shades of color that normally blend in.  For my son, it did not fix all of the targets in the color blind test and I'm curious if any of the other lenses would help more.  For now, it was enough for us to move forward with getting a red filter contact on his non-dominant eye.","[]","B01MS6NJV5","B01MS6NJV5","AEXJTWJSTUURTZPZTCQHQOW4PUPA","2017-04-10 15:31:10.000","107","True","501"

Quick reply and service is what makes a product even better. Even though this product did not work for me, their service makes it easier to have that ease of mind when purchasing products from them.\\n\\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\\n*OK yes I know the picture is not of this product, but its for reference of the stand I used to compare temperature differences - see below*\\n\\nAfter receiving the pad, everything started ok with no issues. The back has 2 USB ports, though you use one for the fan itself. It is nice since you do not have to use up a USB space and lose that a USB port since you can use the one on the cooler. Noise is not silent for me at times, you can hear the fan vibrating. It's not loud, but not silent.\\n\\nPerformance:\\nIt could be that the XPS 9550 laptops are designed a certain way where having fans blow from the bottom does not help much, but the overall performance I saw using CPU temperature monitor was minor vs using the stand (see picture). I hoped having fans would help, but not this one. Again, it could be my specific laptop especially comparing to all the reviews out there. The fan isn't that strong, but you can hear it running. It does make a vibrating noise at times which can be annoying. Sounds like its brushing against something at times, maybe this is the reason for the performance drop.\\n\\nSample performance testing (after running 30 minutes with each stage):\\nIdle temp: 25-28 (while on hard surface) vs. 21-25 (with laptop cooler) vs. 21-26 (while elevated)\\nCPU/GPU intensive processes: 83-87 (while on hard surface) vs. 79-83 (with laptop cooler) vs. 80-84 (while elevated)\\nAgain, minor differences.\\n\\nTLDR: For my XPS 9550 laptop, this worked just as well as elevating using a stand (see pic).

"553362","5","These QC25's compared with Audio Technica M50's","I've owned quite a few headphones over the years.  As far as over the ear headphones I actually have both these QC25's and the Audio Technica ATH-M50X.  The Audio Technica's are basically a 'pure' headphone.  They sound phenomenal, but they're more suited to a quiet environment or at a desk.  That's where the QC25 comes in.  These are absolutely comfortable, sound almost as good (more detail below), great noise cancellation, and the battery life is great.  I did have a pair that started going out in one ear but Bose customer service was excellent and sent me a new pair which as been fine.  The case is nice to have.  I do wonder about how they fold to fit in the case, it might cause some long term durability problems with the wires being bent back and forth but so far so good with my new set.\\n\\nAudio Quality:\\nAs I said above, I think these sound &#34;almost as good&#34; as the M50's that I consider more of a pure sound headphone.  The M50's are widely regarded as one of the best sounding headphones for the money (half the price of the Bose) but they aren't active noise cancelling.  With the Bose QC25, the sound goes through a circuitry for the noise cancellation.  As far as I can tell, its the best active noise cancellation for the price.  It is a &#34;sculpted&#34; sound since it goes through the circuitry, but it sounds excellent overall. For me the bass is more than sufficient, the highs are good and the mids are slightly faded.  Compared to the M50X's, it sounds like there's a faint filter over some of the mid tones, but just barely.  Most vocals are good.  I don't think most people would ever complain about the audio quality of the QC25; and I certainly am not.  Sitting in a quiet setting, the pure sound of the M50's is preferable, however in a noisy environment the QC25 sounds MUCH better, and the QC25 also sits lighter and looser on the head which makes it more comfortable for longer listening times.  For me the QC25 and the M50X have their own niche and can excel in different situations.\\n\\nOverall an excellent headphone.","[]","B00M1NEUKK","B0105VDCZ8","AFOI5H7WZIECAUW4XOBM3CQWDG3Q","2017-02-14 04:56:59.000","1","False","501"
"673435","4","Feels like an Apple wireless keyboard","Feels like an Apple wireless keyboard! I got a cheaper keyboard before this and the keys were all wobbly (Instant regret). Then I bought this Anker keyboard and keys were solid just like I wanted.\\n\\nOne problem I encountered was Page up, page down, home, end buttons did not work at first! When I hold Fn + Left it did WindowsKey + Left instead. I solved this by pressing Fn + D which activated the Windows Keyboard layout. I guess it must have been on iOS or Android by default.\\n\\nedit: changing this from 5 star to 4 star. After 30 minutes the keyboard goes into power saving mode and you have to wait 2 seconds for it to activate again. Or in other words, if you ignore the keyboard for 30 minutes, it will ignore you back for 2 seconds. Gets kind of annoying when this happens multiple times a day. It's only a minor annoyance though. I don't have to turn it off/on like some other people. My Apple wireless bluetooth keyboard never has this problem, and the battery life\\non it is great. I wish Anker could do the same with this keyboard :(\\n\\nedit 2: 5 months later, downgraded to 2 stars. It has begun disconnecting randomly and not responding to key presses. I have to turn it off and on, and reconnect the keyboard in order for it to work again.\\n\\nedit 3: Anker saw my review, and reached out to me. They sent me a new keyboard which was nice. Upgrading to 3 stars. So far it is working okay. I still get disconnected once in a while but this may be a problem with my bluetooth adapter. I have found that all I need to do is unplug and replug in my USB bluetooth adapter and the keyboard automatically reconnects. I'll update this in a few months if the keyboard is still working.\\n\\nFINAL EDIT: After using a different Bluetooth adapter, no more disconnections! The only remaining minor problem is the power saving mode where it turns off and ignores you for 2 seconds. Supposedly it activates only if you don't press anything for 30 minutes but I'm pretty sure it's more like 10 or 15 minutes. Mildly annoying but I've grown used to it. Only other minor problem is the left arrow key doesn't fully press sometimes.","[]","B005ONMDYE","B005ONMDYE","AHAK37Z23RNNNXPGLFFXSPDVPWQA","2017-06-10 22:03:42.460","0","True","501"
"653483","5","Just pick them up","I really like these headphones. I had the oddly colored beige/brown ones, but returned them because they were just too ugly (IMO) to keep.\\nSo when Senn came out with this all black model, I had to pick them up.\\n\\nFit: I have a large head. Like I have to buy specialty hats because it's that big (7 3/4 for those who care).  I usually find the clamping force on full size headphones too painful to wear for extended periods (talking to you Audiotechnica ath-m50!) . The exception to this is my Beyerdynamic 880s which are the most comfortable I've ever owned. These Senns come in a (distant) second which is to say they are comfortable enough to wear for long listening sessions. I suspect the majority of people with smaller (aka normal) sized heads will find these super comfortable.\\n\\nSound: sound is subjective and I won't make an extended comment. I love that these are closed headphones. These get high marks in the audiophile community for their price point. They sound good to me. YMMV depending on your tastes and preferences. Have a look at other reviews for details on soundstage if you believe that will help you make a buying decision. If you these are your first $150 headphone, I suspect you will love these. If you expect these to out preform your Stax electrostatic cans, stop trolling.\\n\\nThese seem to be durable. Since they're not too expensive, I usually just toss them in my bag and go. They are made out of plastic which keeps the weight down and I wonder about their long term durability (had them for several months now) but, thus far, I haven't had reason to doubt these will last given the moderate abuse I put them through on a regular basis.\\n\\nTL;DR: if you are looking for a quality, portable upgrade to your (humongous) Audiotechnica m50s, you'll like these. They aren't as bulky for full size headphones. If you are someone who wants to hear tiny detail in your music, but can't afford to drop $800+ on headphones, which is why you're looking at these, ensure that your tastes and pocketbook align. Haha. Just pick these up; they'll be fine for you.","[]","B01JP436TS","B01JP436TS","AECLZCNLWB6Z3CJWN7PNFHYNVVRQ","2017-02-08 03:33:44.000","45","True","501"
"430035","5","3 months now..","I got this to see if I'd get a volume boost for my over ear Sony MDR-V6 cans. Nope. Not the SMSL's fault.\\nSo I use this amp like this: a Logitech Bluetooth adapter wired out to input of this amp, amp out to aux input of my AudioEngine A5+ bamboo speakers. What this does is pump up the volume and warm up the sound. Now, the warmth thingy is hard to explain but it sort of dampens any harshness especially in quieter stuff like Joe Pass, acoustic stuff. If doing this be careful. I set the volume on zero on the amp and slowly raised it to right around 1 o'clock. It could blow your speakers if you are not careful. I tend to use Apple Music and Tidal as my music source from my iPhone. Speaker volume I keep on full and then one click down. About 95%. Then the SMSL'S volume at 12 to 1 o'clock. I use my iPhone as the primary volume control. I tell you, my AudioEngine speakers now seem to be about 15% louder. It's quite a discernible difference. Of course, the quality of recordings fluctuate wildly. The newer dance, trance, chill stuff sounds wonderful to me. Everything is tight, clean and makes your speakers shine. I find rock music in the 70's to be do poorly recorded and mixed. Muddy. Certain bands are sticklers for quality sound. Steely Dan comes to mind. Anyways, I've found how best to utilize this amp. For me. It's made my little setup that much better sounding with more volume and punch. Plus, it looks cool. People always asking &#34;now what is this?!&#34; I see no reason to not give it 5 stars. If you're looking to &#34;amp&#34; up your headphone/earbuds experience I think you might be a bit disappointed. I found its real place for myself. Tubes don't get really hot either which I like. I might try another type but for now, for this price, this little amp has improved my sound nicely. It also seems to be built well. I've returned my share of Chinese tube mini amps. They all die. This unit has essentially been on 24/7 for almost 3 months now. No crackles, pops, etc. If you're thinking about it, get it.","[]","B06XYJB7S8","B06XYJB7S8","AFN5OQ2IL6EK237IDPJ7YW6CDGVA","2017-11-13 17:07:00.756","4","True","501"

I spent about a month reading reviews, trying to decide which cheap (fairly) generic system I wanted. This is the ticket.\\n\\nPros -\\nThe cameras are all HD 720P quality and look great\\nSetup is quick and painless I didn’t read any directions.\\n4 cameras with room for 4 more\\nThe cables are non-intrusive.\\nGood customer support. I was missing the power cable in my box. I wrote the company via Amazon and had one in a couple of days. I had an extra anyway (standard PC type cable) so no down time.\\n\\nCons\\nThe HDMI output didn't like my TV (or my TV didn't like it - said it was an unsupported format). Never have had that problem with HDMI before. I had to use an old VGA monitor to set it up.\\nYou need to buy a hard-drive. I got the 1 TB WD purple one that seems to be a popular option. Easy to install but plug in the power cable before you mount it. There is a tab built into the housing to keep the cable from coming out, if you mount the drive first, you can’t get the power cord in.\\nNo keyboard driver (why?!?). You have to use the included mouse and onscreen keyboard for everything. Kind of a pain.\\n\\nTips\\nThe cameras seem to like about 15-20 as the max distance. I have one at that distance. It is looks flawless day or night. I have two that are mounted 15 feet off the ground at the top of a hill and are pointed further out an additional 15-20 feet. They still look great during the day but the integrated IR lighting wasn't enough for the cameras to have a good quality picture at night. I ended up buying an aftermarket IR floodlight and that solved the problem. They look great at night now.\\n\\nIf you are in the market for a $100ish system this is the ticket.  If you need more than 4 cameras, buy two. Individually the cameras run about $30 and the cables are another $20. Might as well buy the complete unit and get 4 cameras and 4 cables. The DVR can be a spare.","[]","B01KZJ3RKU","B01KZJ3RKU","AGXXOO4AZDNFHSISRPCN6GJYSGDQ","2017-04-05 02:09:51.000","0","True","501"
"609086","5","My amazing experience with this exact telescope.","I bought this telescope last summer and it has been a blast. I HIGHLY recommend this product to any amateur astronomer just starting out in their backyard. The price is very fair. I have definitely gotten my money's worth. Jupiter, Saturn and it's rings are clearly visible with the starting eyepieces, but I would suggest a Barlow lens to add to your selection first. My first few nights with the scope really changed my perception of our world. Looking above out into space in real time, seeing the moons craters, mars and Venus, but probably the greatest sights are Jupiter and Saturn. It's April 2017 in Tampa, Florida currently and last night Jupiter was out with 4 of its moons also in view. Jupiter was HUGE in my eyepiece even just using the 25mm with a Barlow. Truly incredible. Saturn really is the pride and joy of my viewing with this scope though. Something about those rings will change your life, for real. I insist that anyone looking to see what's really up there for a modest price, definitely get this telescope. I do have only 1 complaint, that I feel must not be left out, any movement to the scope or touching of any part of it will cause the image to jiggle slightly as this is an EXTREMELY sensitive design. But really it's not that big of a deal considering the price, and that fact that once you find an image to view, focus, and let go of the scope, the scope will stop jiggling in 1 to 2 seconds for you to watch the image pass through the eyepiece. So it's really not a big deal. But none the less, the only true complaint I have. I also will recommend a cleaning kit for the scope. I've had the scope about 9 months, and I am finally starting to have uncrisp images due to dirty lenses. Take care of your lenses, keep them clean and use the covers they come with. As far as deep sky objects like nebulae, galaxies, messier objects, I can't really make that stuff out cause it's either too bright where I live, or I need a higher magnification eyepiece. I just have the 25mm and 10mm it came with. Ordered a Barlow lens a few months later. But the planet's and moon, and still looking at stars just to get a closer view is WORTH IT.

The screen size is slightly larger than two 8 1/2&quot;x11&quot;sheets of paper side by side, so it's perfect to leave, say, my email program open on the left and in a separate window on the right leave open my browser.\\n\\nThe separate 125 GB SSD to hold all the Windows operating system files is genius. The PC starts up super fast, yet I have a full 1 TB regular SATA drive to hold my program files, photos, media, etc. (NOTE: When installing new programs, they typically default to your C drive, but you want to re-steer those to your D drive (I simply created a &quot;Programs&quot; folder on the D drive and then install all new programs in sub-folders within that folder. I also changed the default download folder from C to D (within the browser settings), pointing all new downloads to a new &quot;Downloads&quot; folder I created on the D drive.\\n\\nThe screen is really bright, so you may want to go into screen settings and dial it back a bit, if it's too bright for you.\\n\\nThe wireless mouse and keyboard are fine, though the keyboard, being slightly different from my other keyboards, is taking me some time to learn where the keys are.\\n\\nAs others have noted, the built-in camera is useless, being positioned at the bottom of the screen. The image it sends on, say, Skype, is hideous, showing you from a terrible under-the-chin angle. The simple solution is to use a separate webcam that perches on the top of the screen.\\n\\nThe sound is terrible for anything other than speech. Instead, use a set of stereo PC speakers such as Definitive Technology Bipolar Desktop Speakers (I'm a musician and recording engineer and these reproduce all styles of music with great accuracy, though not room-shaking volume).\\n\\nIn sum, very convenient form factor, super-speedy chip and SSD drive, plus 1 TB generous hard drive, gorgeous large clear bright screen (tiltable). Those are the pluses that make it worth buying.

"376082","3","Okay for low usage, terrible for anything more.","TL;DR: Anything without an ethernet port is going to suck no matter how close to wifi it is especially in older houses with a lot of crap in the walls that cause interference. That said, the wifi is sufficient for pandora, and perhaps 720 streams but will SUCK with anything higher. Avoid it if you're an enthusiast like I claim to be, or if you expect your usage to scale to those levels over time as you'll eventually have to replace it when it does.\\n\\nFull: I bought this for an older 1080p TV that while technically a smart tv was showing its age, and I think no longer updated as it was using older app versions. I'm not the primary user of this particular TV and the people using it use fire sticks on their other TVs. These people rarely use my plex and are content using netflix, pandora, hbo prime, etc. but more importantly they are familiar with this setup so I didn't want to go all out and buy an apple tv for it when this was a cheap quick fix (as they said themselves the smart TV sucked). I would get called down occasionally to &#34;fix&#34; problems (buffering, stalling, etc) that was often solved by simply restarting the app or device. I started to loath this device as in the past I was similarly called to fix issues with the other fire sticks they had and I gradually had them upgrade their TVs so the Ethernet runs I ran in the beginning would do their job.\\n\\nUltimately these devices run fine most of the time, but no matter now close to a WiFi signal there will occasionally be issues caused by interference which a normal person wouldn't expect to cause them (vases, containers, metal, etc). I tried to love them as cheap solutions to non primary devices and that's really what they are intended for but as there is no Ethernet there are issues.\\n\\nThe best example of this btw, is when I upgraded the 1080p tv with an apple tv and tried to re-purpose the fire stick on a tv closer to a wifi signal (2ft). In that scenario there was a relatively high ping (30-50 in test) and I just gave up on it for that reason. The UI itself is nice looking and relatively fast but there are bottlenecks. So pissed off was I that I actually wrote this review!","[]","B00ZV9RDKK","B075X8471B","AF3KIZ7UETLANN6AT544WMNRDN4A","2017-12-10 19:04:54.909","4","True","501"
"484363","1","This is a scam.  Scientifically impossible.  Do not buy this.","I was warning people about another one of these devices, and noticed this one, so I literally just cut and pasted my review from that device here.  Every word of it is still true pertaining to this device.\\n\\nElectricity flows much like water, along conductive pipes, i.e. wires.  What makes your appliances work is that as the electricity passes through them, it is converted into other forms of energy, like thermal and kinetic.  All of the unused electricity flows back into the grid after going through your device, much like water comes up out of the faucet, and the excess water goes back down the drain pipe.  The only way this could work is if it was creating more electricity out of nothing, and sending it back into the grid.  Is there some box you could stick on your faucet to turn a gallon of water into 2 gallons?  Well, the same is true of electricity.\\n\\nIn addition, there is a factor to all electric conductors called resistance.  In essence, some of the electricity passing through the wires gets converted into heat, due to tiny impediments at the molecular level.  In other words, if you put 1 volt of electricity into one end of a wire, it will always come out the other end as less than what you put into it.  This device not only creates no electricity, but creates an additional impediment between your device and the grid.  This means that you will actually waste electricity by plugging it in to anything.  Even if this device was a near perfect conductor, the likes of which can cost thousands, or even millions of dollars for mere ounces worth of them, all putting this in between your device and the grid will do is add whatever impediment it causes to what your wires already have.\\n\\nThat brings me to my final point.  I don't know how high the resistance on this device is, but appliances require a large amount of power compared to most other devices in the home.  If you're plugging things like refrigerators, air conditioners, heaters, motors, air compressors, and so on into this box, it might exceed the capabilities of this thing.  That means the wires inside of it could melt, possibly causing your device to lose power, or even a fire.  Using this thing is essentially like plugging an extension cord into an extension cord.","[]","B00ZAMLQUG","B00ZAMLQUG","AH2ALS3GPJ6LDVEDGULOXWADEKAQ","2017-10-08 01:11:53.835","5","False","501"

I went through a polite but frustrating returns process that involved having to take a photo of the headphones with the cable cut (This could be so easily photoshopped... but whatever, I liked the headphones and just wanted a replacement).\\n\\nSo in February 2017 I got a replacement from Jaybird. Then the replacement pair broke after just four months of use, and before an important event for me, the San Francisco marathon. They would not turn on or charge. The same issue as with the first pair.\\n\\nI liked the product, was in a groove using them and didn't want to change equipment before the race so I immediately bought another pair on June 25. I did not return or report the problem with the other pair at that time, expecting another slow customer service experience.

I've persevered with their product, given them feedback, and been patient with their slow customer support process. I was told that because the product was not directly from Jaybird and they were more than 30 days old, that I wouldn't be entitled to a refund. I think this is unjustified, given the issues I faced. I've tried to escalate my case, but I'm not hopeful that Jaybird will do anything about it in a timely manner, so I'm posting here to help others avoid these problems.\\n\\nI hope Jaybird is able to build a more resilient product in the future.

I chose the Anker because of how reinforced they are, the features, the great reviews, and because they are MFi Certified by Apple. I was so happy with them, that my husband had me order another one for him. Recently, two of the three died- at the very same time-while on a car trip (something I did?). When using the cable, a message would come up that said, “This accessory may not be supported.” There was no sign of anything on the outside showing wear. They still looked brand new! I went back to my product order to see if there was a warranty, and was pleasantly surprised to find out that there was, and it was for 18 months! I had purchased the cables about 17-18 months previously. I contacted Anker, and received an email back the same day saying it had been received, and they gave me a ticket number. The following day, I got a personal email telling me this usually doesn’t happen, they were sorry, and that both cables would be replaced. I even received an email the following day, and I was particularly impressed with these statements: “Don’t worry. If in the future you have the same issue with other lightning cables (including the replacements we will send you), please know that you can find us for replacement.” Wow! I’m thrilled to get the replacements, which were shipped the next day, with an email notifying me of the shipment, and a tracking number. A week later, I received a follow up email that included these statements, “Do let us know if you still need our help. We’re ready and waiting to find a solution to your problem.” Another wow! I love the cables and how well they charge (fast) and the customer service just as much! We believe in the brand and previously ordered an Anker PowerCore 26800, external battery with 3 USB ports and a 6 port wall charger, and love them as well!  (The photo is of the original, 17 month cables. They still look brand new!) I am giving this product 5 stars because of how well they work and because of the fantastic customer service experience. I would definitely buy it/them again because I know Anker stands by their products!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tBzROfzPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tBzROfzPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tBzROfzPL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B0177NSA9A","B0177NSA9A","AHRL3553AKQRICT32EWTWFM5QQ6A","2017-10-22 17:59:54.883","0","True","501"
"76934","3","Mixed Feelings...","This is my third Echo product; I already have a 1st generation Echo, a 1st gen Dot, and now this new 2nd Gen Echo. We have Hue lights throughout the house, along with some additional smart home devices, so my goal is to make using those devices easier to use with voice access in key rooms. I also hoped to enjoy the “improved sound” advertised in the name.\\nSo why did I give  it just three stars? First, we wanted to use the drop-in feature across the house as a room to room intercom. Unfortunately, that did not work as I had hoped. Amazon requires that you grant access to your contacts for drop-in to work, allowing them to upload the information to their servers. I don’t understand why they need all my contacts in order for me to talk from one Echo device to another registered on the same account in the same household on the same wifi. That’s unreasonable.\\nSecond, I wanted to utilize the multiple room music feature. My phone is my primary music playing device, so using bluetooth to stream is my norm. However, the multi-room feature only seems to work if you are using one of the music services. Plus, we use Apple Music, which isn’t an option. While I am not surprised it’s not there, it would be nice if it was. (Why can’t multi-billion dollar companies play nicely together?)\\nThird, I am not impressed with the sound. I hear no substantial difference from the first gen (I have the most updated firmware as of Nov 26, 2017). It doesn’t sound bad, but it’s nothing impressive in even a medium sized room. If you are going to claim “improved sound” in the product name, it should be at least a noticeable improvement.\\nFourth, and this is a small quibble, we ordered the sandstone fabric (white) version, to blend in with our decor. Why is the cord and plug black? Details matter... a white cord with the white device. If you are going to advertise multiple colors to match decor, then make the entire device match.\\nI am hoping that having Alexa access in multiple rooms is going to be more useful. The ball is in Amazon’s court to make these devices really useful, as opposed to just a novelty.","[]","B06XXM5BPP","B07456BG8N","AGEAPQKCIAXEDWFYKW2TEAJ42PHA","2017-11-26 06:10:21.280","7","True","501"
"634046","5","Amazing Sound Quality and Battery Life in a Tiny, Inexpensive Package","Amazing sound quality for a very small package. Comfortable enough, and small enough, for all day use and battery life to match. I typically wear it for ten hours a day (standby/audio/calls/Siri) and get well over the advertised five hours of audio play. I didn't except to use it for phone calls, Siri, or dictation but I do and all work extremely well. Call quality is better than the factory Bluetooth of my car (Sync in a 2010 Ford Fusion) and I switched off Sync in favor of using the GoNovate G8.\\n\\nThe ONLY complaint I have is the volume being too high for some podcasts; I rarely use it beyond the lowest volume level. Music is fine for me at the lowest level but sound levels are inconsistent across podcasts (sometimes between episodes of the same podcast) and sometimes the lowest volume isn't low enough.\\n\\nFor the price, $17, I expected to use it for a few weeks and buy a replacement as needed until I could purchase Apple's AirPods. Four weeks later, I'm still using the first G8 (haven't needed others) and I've postponed buying AirPods (I still plan to buy them but I'm no longer in a hurry).\\n\\nI've recommended the G8 to friends and coworkers and they love it too.\\n\\nWhile not a complaint, perspective buyers need to realize that the G8 does not let in outside noise. But, since the G8 is a single-ear earbud, I can hear outside noises and conversations perfectly well while using it. It just takes a little while to get accustomed to hearing from one ear.\\n\\nOne of my favorite uses for the G8 is watching TV/movies on my iPad in bed while my wife watches something else or through the AppleTV while she sleeps. I assign the G8 as the outgoing sound source and watch without disturbing her.\\n\\nOne last kudos to GoNovate. My G8 came with two magnetic charger and they are excellent; get the G8 near the charger and the magnet sucks it in. One of the chargers it came with was broken (the plastic housing was cracked) but GoNovate fast-shipped a replacement when I emailed asking how to request a replacement (zero conversation and zero hassle). Excellent customer service!","[]","B01LWUFECM","B01MA3NX96","AFNQRIKH5NRL35WHOEK4245KBCNQ","2017-01-07 18:21:29.000","19","True","501"

"421817","5","Impressive & Well Worth the Money","I've recently written a review of the Triple Driver earphones and the issue of the failed product has been rectified to my satisfaction. Thank you to 1More's impressive customer service and a big thumbs up to their customer service rep, Joe, for going above and beyond.\\nI've been using the Quads every day now for about 3 wks; playing a myriad of musical genres but, only music that I normally play and know.\\nUsing my FiiO hi-res audio player and flac music files with the Quads, I've played Blues, Rock, Jazz, Folk, Country and their mixed and sub-genres. Overall, the Quads breath new life into my LPs and older CDs and enhances new and remastered albums. I can now usually better make out what the singer is saying and hear what I didn't even know was there. In other words, the Quads allow you to hear more of what the artist meant to be heard. I wouldn't be surprised if these earphones were tuned to the remastered versions of the Beatles' catalog. They sound great. Most of what I listen to sound so much better. Don't forget, all albums are not created equal. Production varies so widely and some albums, well, are just badly produced. Also remember we each hear and interpret what we hear differently so, don't hesitate to use your equalizer and the right earphone tips. I use the mid sized foam tips. Overall, very good soundstage/separation, clean lows and no-shrill highs. With my on-board equalizer set to flat response across the board, I found the mid-range to be a bit lacking but, no problem, I just gave a little boost to the mids and these babies sound great. They're also built quite well. Don't forget though that if you do have a problem with them, 1More's customer service is second to none. I do highly recommend the Quads. I love 'em! IMHO, they're worth twice the price. By the way, if you can't or won't spend the money for the Quads, then you can't go wrong with the Triples at half the price. They too are quite impressive. Oh yeah, the Triples & Quads are the first earphones to be THX certified AND they both top Consumer Reports Stereo Headphone rankings. That's saying something. Congratulations 1More!","[]","B06XSJV5B9","B06XSJV5B9","AFVYG7YKDADETTIIAD3JISZUDMGQ","2017-09-01 05:04:21.949","25","True","500"
"843154","5","- A True Masterpiece System -","I did read prior reviews that left me on the edge as whether to buy or not. After careful thought I made the decision to buy this. I can tell you that his system is one of the best.  After having a Fire Stick,  I can really see the difference in features and performance.  The Fire TV box and controller is awesome. I didn't truly buy it to play games, since I have an XBOX1, but the ability to do that is a nice feature. This box is absolutely fast and delivers without question.  The processor is lightning fast and the controller is effortlessly smooth.  Some other reviews down played the controller, but mine works great and is exactly the same type as an XBOX 1 controller as far as handling and style.  Amazon got it right with this newest version.  Using the Qwerty board, in other add-on apps, with the controller is actually easier than the hand held remote.  The addition of extra storage provided by the micro-SD card is very nice.  The ability to transfer music, videos, and other movies to this card and then play on the Fire TV is priceless.  Purchasing this box it did also come with 2 Free Add-on Games already installed.  Most of the Games can be downloaded and most are free.  I really enjoy this box.  Oh yay, Alexia works well and responds fast to your questions and as advertised, can find music, TV shows, and movies just by asking.  I highly recommend this product.  The only thing that I would advise is after initial setup and your registration, immediately update the firmware. Go into Amazon system and push the update button. It only takes about 10 minutes, but the newest version OS 5.0.5 is award winning and resolves a lot of issues posted by others.  Go get this system!!  You won't regret it.  I have added many apps for streaming and it delivers.  I have the Major player App &#34;K&#34;, like the bear, and it runs  flawlessly on the ARM 64 bit download.  All other Fire Sticks and prior Fire TV Box versions have to run on the 32 bit platform.  A big enhancement in the technology world.  One platform system for all your streaming needs.  As indicated, the specs are great and the capability to either hard wire to your internet or connect via wireless is much better.","[]","B00XNQECFM","B00XNQECFM","AHKLREV5FR3QGRDF2DXIQKM2XX2Q","2017-03-17 12:42:39.000","20","True","500"
"440618","5","Good camera with better quality pictures than most and at a good price","This is my second product from this same company. The first one I use for an area in my workshop so that my wife can find me when I'm not in the house. I liked it so much that I decided to add this unit for outside security. Overall the camera works pretty well, providing clear enough picture quality to allow me to identify anyone who comes to the door. The outdoor picture I've included is from a side entrance on our street, near the driveway. This is an area away from the main living quarters, so it needed the extra security. As you can see, the overall picture quality is pretty high, and I was very pleased with it. Of course, at night your eyes don't pick up the colors but I can say that the picture quality in daylight will let you see them well. The contrast is good, which means I don't get that washed out appearance.\\n\\nOverall, the camera was very easy to setup. I used the software from the manufacturer, set it up on my network, and then got everything coordinated for use in multiple locations as I checked it out. So far I have had no problems with the camera or its usability. The instructions that come with the system are easy to follow and if you have a problem then simply go to the company's website: sv3c.com. You can download product manuals and software for the camera.\\n\\nTwo of the things that I liked the most about this camera was the ability to change the angle and the variable focus. I must admit it took me a little experimentation to get the best pictures, but once I made some minor changes it all came in pretty well. To be honest, I wasn't expecting that good of picture based on a couple of other reviews I had seen, but if you are patient then you can get pretty decent output from the camera. As for the night vision, I did not get a chance to use it since most of the areas around my house have some sort of lighting setup. But as you can see, it does pick up in low light a lot better than one might expect. According to the website, the camera provides 25-30M night vision distance, which is fairly far away. Using the 2.8mm-12mm&quot; Varifocal lens&quot; meant that I could  adjust the sytem to see more clearly even in areas where external light wasn't as great.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41+uWi8rW9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41+uWi8rW9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41+uWi8rW9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Vj1K2KOlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Vj1K2KOlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Vj1K2KOlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51H5WF6HpGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51H5WF6HpGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51H5WF6HpGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51bNYrb53+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51bNYrb53+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51bNYrb53+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B06VWLCZTV","B06VWLCZTV","AEDYSLUMXUBNRL6MTYW4DUCYQQFQ","2017-08-10 02:08:11.549","0","True","500"
"986548","5","Brydge 12.3 truly makes your Surface Pro a laptop!","The Brydge 12.3 turns your Surface Pro 3/4 into a small laptop. I pre-ordered mine directly from Brydge when they announced it and was nervous never having tried it, but I was attracted to the idea of using the Surface as a laptop without needing to use the kickstand as on other keyboards. Brydge sent updates and the unit shipped on time. I will say the one inconvenience was having to remove the pre-installed grips for the SP4 and install the ones I needed for the SP3. The SP3 grips come included in the package, but it is a hassle to remove the existing SP4 ones and making sure the residue won't cause issues. If I could take away a half-star I would, its a one-time gripe that doesn't affect the use after that, but its still an ordeal.\\n\\nHowever, ever since then, my Surface has replaced my laptop. I take the SP3 and Brydge with my on business trips and I love the compact size. I've seen people on flights or in conferences use their Surface with other keyboards and try to make enough space for the kickstand. The Brydge is sturdy enough to counterweight the Surface, so it does feel like a small laptop when using it. Typing and using the mouse has a natural feel to me, and I have large hands. One small note is that this trackpad doesn't have independent buttons, so clicking can be an issue, but I typically tap, or use the touchscreen anyway, so not an issue for me. Removing the Surface is fairly easy - the fit is snug, but its supposed to me to make sure it stay together when you intend it! The battery life is excellent, I rarely have to charge it. Also, I have not experienced any connectivity issues others have reported.\\n\\nI recently got a Surface Dock, so between that and my Brydge, my Surface is now my primary desktop and laptop device. I get home, remove the Brydge, connect my Dock, and now my laptop is a desktop. When the Brydge and Surface are closed, its like a laptop, a bit on the sturdy side, but solid and it looks good. I've had a few other Surface users ask me what it was and where I got it. Overall, the Brydge has greatly increased the productivity I get from using my Surface.","[]","B01N13TX2J","B01N13TX2J","AGLJJHNZIBDQ4LFURRNNQDUZLNBA","2017-09-20 14:15:40.289","5","False","500"

"172345","5","Great for Adding Adaptive Memory to Android Tablets","My RePad 8 Android 6.0.1 tablet is no slouch when it comes to memory. It arrived with 2G RAM for the OS and 32G of flash storage for applications and other things. Plus it has a MicroSD Card Slot that is just crying to have something plugged into it.\\n\\nMany modern versions of Android have two different memory modes for external MicroSD cards. There is the &#34;portable mode&#34; when the SD card holds information like photos and files and can be swapped in and out of the device. Them there is the &#34;Adaptive mode&#34; where the MicroSD card becomes a more or less permanent part of the device's memory. This mode does not allow the removal of the MicroSD card, but it really boosts the device's memory capability.\\n\\nFor the Portable mode, just about any MicroSD card will work. However, the Adaptive Mode is far more picky about cards because the performance of the MicroSD card directly impacts the performance of the device itself. In fact, the RePad 8 tablet has rejected every MicroSD card that I have inserted in it when I asked it to run the card in the Adaptive Mode.  Every card, that is, until I inserted the Samsung 100MB/s (U3) MicroSD PRO Select Memory Card.\\n\\nWhen I inserted that card, the RePad 8 was quite happy to accept it and it immediately adopted the MicroSD card as part of its internal memory. No surprise as the Samsung 100MB/s (U3) MicroSD PRO Select Memory Card is rated as Class 10 UHS 3. (Translation: It's fast!) The Settings App showed a kick up in memory from the internal roughly 32 GB to an overall 56.03 GB. (You never get access to all the rated memory.  It's just the way things work.)\\n\\nWith this kind of memory, I should never have to worry about having too many photos, too many videos, too many songs, too many apps or apps that are too large. Yes, there will be a bit of a performance hit over the internal Flash memory because external cards are never as fast as the internal Flash memory in a device. Still, I can live with that because, with this kind of memory at my disposal in an Android Tablet, life will be grand!","[]","B06XWZ7L1Q","B071226QBS","AE37Q6TCPNWG4RUJMJIKRYFBI4CQ","2017-06-13 16:07:50.562","2","False","500"
"722412","4","5.6","This lens had an interesting review in a landscape magazine and went to Amazon not five minutes after reading.\\nI think that this kit is a terrific value.\\n\\nWide open this is 5.6 and is something worth bearing in mind when shooting.  I am most always at 200 - 400 and 800 if my subject isn't lit by direct sun.  I would have ponied up a few hundred dollars more for something that was a bit brighter from Tamron.\\n\\nWould I have preferred the Nikon?  ABSOLUTELY!!!  Is this giving me great pics of birds at our feeders?  Yep.\\nTo be certain, my Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II AF-S Nikkor (also an Amazon purchase) gives me sharper images.  But given the money, I expect that from a professional tool.\\n\\nThe Tamron is a heavy, well-built lens with a number of critical features including stabilization and being able to lock the lens in position.\\nI do expect it to suck up dust over time as the  volume changes from 150 - 600.  But that's me worrying about my gear and less about the time I enjoy shooting.  Besides if this really was a sticking point I could solve this by dropping $9500 on the brighter Nikon 600mm f/4.\\n\\nOne possibly negative observation is that the lens does seem to suck up power relatively quickly.  But that is probably due to the work which is being done when the magic of auto focus has to move heavy glass to where it needs to be.  The work around is to carry an extra battery or two; just what pockets are for.\\n\\nThe bonus with this kit was being able to give all the accessories to a nephew just starting out in photography (yes, I am that cheapskate, relatively thoughtless uncle).\\n\\nWhile I know this isn't the place to comment on the seller Beach Camera packed my kit with a heck of a lot of attention.  I didn't notice that the &#34;Tamron Original Tap-In Console&#34; wasn't in the big box  — until it arrived by separate shipping a few days ago.\\n\\nNow I have to figure out how to make good pics even better with this lens!","[]","B01LW6L7WM","B01LW6L7WM","AFSPFIZ7MTRH3PVFBTTTJFE7W4IA","2017-06-02 15:50:37.000","7","True","500"

After this I could never go back to the on-board sound.","I've always been a high computer enthusiast that has always had the best computer hardware money could buy. Every time a new CPU or GPU came out I would upgrade but I've never been much of an audiophile until I got a chance to use my Hyper X Cloud headset on my friends PC with an old Creative X-Fi sound card. It was incredible to hear the difference between my PC on-board sound card outputting at 60ohms vs his X-Fi sound card at 90omhs. So when I got home I decided that I would give a sound card a try and I came across the Sound Blaster Zx for under $120 so I bought it. One day later it was in my PC and I was ready to rock. I will admit I did have some issues with installing the drivers, for some reason Windows 10 would automatically download the basic driver that would cause the Creative Sound Driver to crash during install. After a quick google search I found the solution and I'm officially in love with my new sound card.\\n\\nPros:\\n-Inexpensive Sound Card that produces good bass and clear sound\\n-With a good headset capable of higher ohms this sound card is amazing for being $100-150 cheaper then a decent DAC Amp\\n-Very nice looking design that matched with my gaming PC very well\\n-High quality volume control knob on the Zx version that allows for quick switching between my speaker and headset without getting behind my PC. Its also a left saver for people like me who own headsets without a manual volume adjuster\\n-Extreme easy to use drivers with decent equalizer and effect controls\\n\\nCons:\\n-Drivers can be a pain to install the first time, and you probably need to do some research to figure out a way around the install issues\\n-Bright red light on the sound card cannot be turned off, so for some people this would be really annoying (not a huge deal but it doesn't match the rest of my case led design)\\n- I wish the volume control knob had 2 outputs to I could more easy switch between my speakers and headset (not a big deal by any means)\\n\\nSeriously though if you are thinking about getting a good entry level sound card without breaking the bank this card is very impressive and I couldn't be happier.\\n-","[]","B009XDWUCQ","B009XDWUCQ","AF5FRCQ6W72YMBOAU3Y3LO5V2GKA","2017-02-08 09:48:24.000","1","True","500"
"132626","5","You won't regret buying this turntable!","I previously had a cheap $50ish USB turntable, someone had given me, that had a built in preamp, and I hooked to my stereo. I didn't think the change in sound would be too drastic. It is. Even with the cheap turntable, by keeping my records clean and cleaning the stylus, I had little to no surface noise (crackles & pops). But with albums I listen to all the time (digitally on the go, as well as vinyl) I could tell there was something off. It sounded less &#34;present&#34; and flat, and one channel was definitely a bit weaker (ambient sounds in the background were barely audible).\\n\\nThe debut carbon is surprisingly easy to set up, the hardest part for me was following the written instructions for the counterweight on the tonearm. But after a quick 3min video on YouTube, I got it right and instantly I was impressed. I had already purchased the Pro-ject Phono MM preamp (trying to solve those weakness issues I mentioned on the cheap TT). So I was good to go out of the box.\\n\\nI experienced no motor hum (some people have complained about, I believe project fixed this), nor any signal hum (issue with weak grounding, which is user error, because you connect the ground). I had this beauty up and running in about 10minutes. It sounds amazing. The ortofon 2m red stylus cartridge is phenomenal.\\n\\nThe difference now is the music is not only present, but dynamic. I also use a cork mat, which makes the low end really warm and punchy, so I was worried the high end would be lost. NOPE. Very balanced all around. The clarity of the Pro-ject TT and Preamp together is great. I listened to some rock (alternative & punk), some acoustic folksy stuff, and a jazz record. All played amazingly well. I cannot recommend this table enough.\\n\\nI did the research, had friends recommend others like the AudioTechnica LP120, saying this is all aesthetics etc. if you care about music enough to make listening to (and truly absorbing/appreciating an album) your solitary activity, then you'll appreciate not only the sound this brings, but you won't mind the fact that it's manual.","[]","B00IIMXATU","B00IIMXATU","AHI2JCT4QVCJLQICAO64CYXQ3NVQ","2017-03-02 15:32:13.000","1","False","500"
"241764","2","Nice Graphics but ........","Bought from HSN to replace a Nuvi 750.  The price included free map downloads which I didn't have with 750.\\n\\nPros:\\nVoice recognition.  You can ask it to get one of your saved addresses, and tell it to start the new route.  No need to enter it in manually.\\nNice graphics mode.\\nA better car adapter.\\n\\nCons:\\nThe display is larger than my old 750, but the space is limited by the options that are offered on the left margin which means reduced space for graphic representation of your route.  The screen on the 750 actually appears larger as the maps fill the screen.\\nThe more options offered onscreen, the less space there is for the actual function of displaying the route.\\n\\nI like to use text mode most of the time instead of the graphics – I like to look at the whole route as I progress.  The distance did not update as I drove.  I was told that the default is to keep the info static and that there is an option to change it.  I never found it.\\n\\nTwo days in a row, evidently the unit lost the signal or whatever, and it stopped as I was driving along to my destination and asked me to select a destination again.  It then asked me if I wanted to add on to the current route or start a new one.  I had to pull over and stop to ask it to re-select my destination and proceed.  On the 750 – not a problem.  If it lost the signal, it would say “Recalculating” and proceed with the original trip without additional input from me.\\n\\nGlare-Reflection:  A constant problem. So bad, that I could not discern what was on the screen. The Nuvi 750 has an anti-glare screen.  Not so on the 2589LMT.  I’ve returned it and  went back to using my old unit.\\n\\nSummary – didn’t like having to pull over and hash out things on every trip.  If I had nothing to compare it to, then maybe I’d say it’s good enough.  However, when you haven’t had to deal with these issues in the past it becomes annoying.","[]","B00N41UTCG","B00N41UTCG","AFUTDKEDEENL7I6ZXWO6UWPGYYKA","2017-01-26 01:10:24.000","1","False","500"
"902684","5","A great solution for gamers","Update 11/25/2017:\\nI now have a Xbox One X and wanted to mention the following quirk. If I turn on the X before my tv or if the switch is on a different input, the picture will display &#34;snow&#34; or run at the wrong (much lower) resolution. And if I switch to a different input on the SwitchDeck while the X is on and switch back to it, it'll display snow or nothing (did this waiting for a game to install). Both are minor inconveniences. This is the only system I've tried that this happens with (Nintendo Switch, PS4 Pro, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U, HD modded original NES are fine). I'm wondering if there's a system setting that'd rectify this, but it's not that a big deal to me.\\n\\nOriginal review:\\nThe unit is actually much smaller than I imagined from the pics. Very easy to setup and use. It does feature auto switching so whichever device is turned on is the HDMI channel the unit changes to. I'm currently running a PS4 Pro, Nintendo Switch, and a NES(with Kevtris Hi-Def HDMI kit), each with about 12ft of HDMI cable total from system to switch to tv, and they all work fine with no picture quality loss, or problems with HDR in the case of the PS4 Pro. I also have a Framemeister which outputs in HDMI with a SNES, Sega Genesis, PS2, and a Wii fed through it. I only tried the SNES and it did display a picture but unfortunately it was a mess, vertical lines and just garbled. I still have free HDMI ports on my TV though so it wasn't a must for me and I didn't do much troubleshooting. So a word of caution Framemeister owners, you may have the same problem. This is with a Samsung KU6290 55&#34; 4k TV. All my HDMI cables, besides the ones that came with my video game systems, are the latest standard compatible Amazon Basic brand.\\n\\nOne thing to note, the remote uses a CR2025 battery and it is NOT included, but it is weird that the battery tray has an activation pull tab on it as if there was one in it(manufacturer's site says it doesn't come with a battery).","[]","B01N2L9AE4","B01N1UHP9G","AFJWJYTNK256YAXITAI3NSBBLZJQ","2017-10-16 01:11:48.990","4","True","500"
"980090","5","Another Great Samsung Tablet","So I've had this Galaxy Tab S3 for a little over months now so I've had a chance to use it day in and day out for a little while now. This is certainly not my first Samsung Tablet, nor one with a S Pen so I can compare. In the past I've used a Galaxy Note 10.1 (both the original 2012 version and the 2014 edition) and more recently the Galaxy Tab A 10.1 2016 edition with S Pen.\\n\\nPrior to this tablet, I had the Galaxy Tab A 10.1 2016 edition with S Pen which honestly is a great cost-efficient alternative to this tablet. However, I never fully liked because it's thick and heavy and the screen resolution is sub-par; however the battery life is amazing. So when I discovered this was released in June and studied the specs, I was &#34;excited&#34; to upgrade.\\n\\nHere's the good and bad in my opinion. The screen is perfection. The QHD resolution is a big step up from the Galaxy Tab A and is on part with the QHD phones out now. I'm starting to feel much more comfortable with the 4:3 aspect ratio as it works for the books I study and utilize. The S Pen is awesome! Coming from the smaller S Pen generation and even having one now with my Note 8 phone, I like the bigger size S Pen because it feels like you're writing with an actual pen. Additionally, the tip is very defined and clear. The four surrounding speakers sounds awesome for watching videos. The processor is very snippy, making multi-window and popup window use easy.\\n\\nThe bad in my opinion is the battery life. I mean with full use, you can easily get a full day (2 days with minimal use) of use out of it so it's not horrible per say but you can get like a WEEK out of the Galaxy Tab A. However, I understand why. With the four speakers and it's slim profile, a 6,000 mAh battery is the likely the biggest they could possibly fit in here without having a &#34;Note-7 like&#34; catastrophe. Plus, you can't scale down the resolution to FHD like on the Note 8 in order to salvage some battery life. So all in all, since that's the only bad in my opinion, I thoroughly recommend this tablet.","[]","B01MTGLBP5","B06XC2GJTF","AH6HWFQ7ZXZ46LKZCLIMSTMIKXYQ","2017-10-24 12:16:39.271","1","False","500"
"970372","5","So far, so good. I like the bag. An updated review",":::Update::: 8/30/2017\\n\\nIt's a little hard to write a review when you first get the back. After some use, you can begin to see how it's constructed and the durability of it.\\n\\nThe stitching is very tight.  Excellent in my opinion as I tend to overload my bags at time. Though on this particular bag, I can't by much. Which is a good thing. Fits two medium sized binders and an extra large text book (think phone book. If you remember those) with adjustments at the magnet buckles for more top space.\\n\\nBeing made of a denim/canvas material (not really sure) it's pretty durable. I have the slate color and it hasn't faded or rubbed its color off on my clothing, a big plus.\\n\\nThe front pockets are hidden by the enourmous flap down top. They are brass style buttons that must be pushed in to close. The flap down top, extending over the top, adds to conceal and an extra guard in case you where to leave them open, so you wouldn't be lose anything that was in them.\\n\\nThe side pockets have no magnets and is adjustable via the same buckles as the main flap. You won't be able to carry anything tall or wide in them, but they are perfect for your wallet and keys.\\n\\nAll the buckles seem to be leather products and are very durable. So expect a level of rigidity and stiffness as you first start to use them. They will take some time to soften up.\\n\\nThe strap is fixed at the ends with no swivel (but adjustable when it comes to length). It's also heavy stitched, with a leather guard depicting the middle of the strap. You must make sure the strap is straight and un-twisted as it is not self adjusting at the ends to compensate.\\n\\nFor a bag under $40 you are getting a lot of durability and use. If you need more space, you should look into something else as this bag is made only to carry what you would need on a day to day. If you're planning for dooms day (and want to stuff your office in here) this is not your bag. Checkout other products of from Geartrnic for that.","[]","B01AODIV76","B07FY19B4Q","AHD5CO2LNLTIR325YDBF47WDC3OA","2017-08-23 15:19:43.198","1","True","500"

Recent update 6.3.24-2 fixes a major problem that happened when drawing small detail (line segment was automatically added from end-of-stroke to start-of-stroke)\\n-If you are drawing small details and &#34;right-click&#34; menu keeps popping up. You can disable this in control panel (control panel&#62; hardware and sound &#62; pen and touch). I wish Wacom has this configurable in pen setting, so user don't need to dig in Windows setting.\\n\\nStylus\\n-If you worry about nib wear and don't want to spend another $30 on Wacom's smooth surface, you can get [[ASIN:B06XYTYR2W POSRUS NibSaver Surface Cover for Wacom Intuos Pro Pen and Touch Medium Tablet (PTH660)]].  It's a much cheaper solution and it is much smoother than the included Wacom sample.\\n-Plastic buttons on the stylus are a bit loose. You can wiggle the plastic without actual button press. Also, the lower button is easily mis-triggered. I end up disable them both. Stylus is very fat comparing to pencil.\\n\\nTablet\\n-Buttons on the tablet are easily mis-triggered.  Usually, good physical buttons should work like this.  You press them, you hear &#34;clicks&#34; sound and buttons triggered.  Buttons on Wacom tablet are not good.  They can be mis-trigger with slight pressure, without pressing them (no &#34;click&#34; sound).\\n\\n(Additional thought)\\nI purchased medium size tablet.  Physically it is almost as big as 15 inch laptop.  If you use keyboard shortcuts, this is a great companion bluetooth keyboard [[ASIN:B0148NPAT0 Logitech K380 Multi-Device Bluetooth Keyboard (Blue) (920-007559)]].

"377007","5","Simply an amazing product. Ok","Simply an amazing product.  Ok... let's break it down...\\n\\nThe remote is much larger than I thought, but that makes it good so it's not lost so easily.  The buttons are easy to use and it gives you all the basics.\\n\\nWe have our TV hung up on the wall and the outlets are down on the ground level, which means the charging cord doesn't quite reach.  So a little longer charger cord would be nice (about 3-4 feet I think.)\\n\\nThe apps are easy to install and to navigate.  The main screen make suggestions to you or lets you view your recently used apps.  Then makes suggestions of shows or movies you might enjoy.  As others state, it is very Prime oriented (shows you those first and has them front and center) but what do you expect from an Amazon product.\\n\\nThe bluetooth is a nice addition, as is the screen saver.  Very adjustable.  Another great feature is how it puts itself to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.  This is great for people who fall asleep to the TV or who forget to turn off the device.  Since there is not traditional &#34;off&#34; to the Firestick (you're supposed to unplug it) this is a good aspect to keep it from overheating and being over used.\\n\\nI have a mini bluetooth keyboard with touch-pad paired up with it.  It helps to navigate different apps.\\n\\nThe main part is how well KODI works.  It is very easy to install and runs Grrreat!  Feels quicker and smoother than even my laptop does; which is a pleasant but unexpected surprise.\\n\\nI have read some reviews where people said it doesn't have a screen mirroring feature.  This is Definitely not true.  While it may be a little more clicky than Chromecast, my HTC M9 would often pause and get stuck with screen mirroring on our TV, but the screen mirroring feature for the Firestick has a little flicker to it but it does connect fast and it stays running without pausing.\\n\\nOverall it's an excellent product that is super easy to use and very convenient.  I plan to buy one for my other TV as well.","[]","B00ZV9RDKK","B075X8471B","AE2DFQNAM7C6734JKCMWG7DVD25Q","2017-04-22 16:18:56.000","10","True","500"
"259040","5","A lot better than I expected","I had been looking for another portable speaker for a little while since my iHome took a poop on me. I've always been a fan of V-MODA and I couldn't refuse a chance at one of these.\\n\\nThe overall size isn't bad at all. It's big enough to catch your attention, yet small enough to not mind carrying it around.\\n\\nI mainly use potable speakers for work. I work as a tech at a dealership, so I need something small to maintain my work space. I personally like using Bluetooth just for the ease of answering calls/texts when I need to. V-MODA offers a stable Bluetooth setup. So much so that in one of our shops, I stood 100' away, phone in hand, and it was still playing!\\n\\nOne thing I love about the REMIX is that the quality of sound in phenomenal. While I'm in my work area, it sounds like a full stereo system! Miss and highs are clearly played and lows can be felt in a close distance. Yes, in a good acoustical area, I could feel the bass a little! I typically like my music loud, so I assumed the REMIX would bother the other techs. I was wrong, it didn't overpower background noise at all. But when my shop 10,000 sq ft+ was empty, I could hear my music everywhere!\\n\\nI won't deny, I was skeptical of how well it would sound with so many components being made from a 3D printer. But I was dumbfounded.\\n\\nThe REMIX advertises a 10 hour play time. So I put it to work for a whole week. Plug it in before bed and then take it to work. It made it through 10 hour days (lunch included, so it got a constant 10 hours without a break) without an issue. According to my iPhone, it still had 25-30% battery left.\\n\\nSounds phenomenal, Bluetooth is reliable, and the battery lasts longer than advertised (even when it's Bluetooth'd all day). I'd be hard pressed to find another portable speaker that contends with the REMIX.\\n\\nOne thing I didn't want to test, is the rigidity of the REMIX. But it sure would be cool to know if it could withstand a minor impact.","[]","B06XP1JGCT","B08BXKYV1Z","AHFH5KL4WMAFUAOIYJ3EMNALGYWA","2017-04-20 05:15:48.000","20","True","500"
"173810","3","Serious Pros & Cons but overall a good value for the price","It's a bright shiny new tablet! (My prior tablet was a Google Nexus 7). But because I have previously owned a Google Nexus I just can't rate this at 5 stars.\\n\\nPros - AMAZING battery life. I left it on for days and it was still at 70% a week later... really? Yes! Really. Granted I wasn't using it heavily during those 7 days but still.... that is just crazy! Super convenient to adjust the font sizes for more comfortable reading. I am sure my hubby went with this model because the price could not be beat. You can integrate popular tablet apps pretty easily like Facebook, Twitter, etc. and it comes preloaded with a lot of Amazon apps you would want if you use Amazon products like the Kindle app.\\n\\nCons - It does not navigate as intuitively as my Google Nexus did. Granted, it's probably going to take me awhile to &#34;make friends&#34; with this tablet so it isn't such a soul sucking experience trying to surf the web, or navigate through book options while browsing. I really resent that when you add a book to the wishlist and try to go back, it takes you straight back to the beginning of all categories, versus just back to the previous page where you were easily. (That may be user error on my part, but after much fiddling around I haven't found an easy way around this.) That may be more of a flaw on the Kindle app than the actual tablet, but considering that is was the primary reason for purchase I still consider it a con. Another hard con, is when you surf the web, the web pages seem to favor rendering the full web version versus a mobile friendly version. So I notice text on web pages (including Amazon.com) for this tablet can display text so small there is no way anyone is reading it clearly. It doesn't seem to respond to &#34;pinch or reverse pinch&#34; well - which should be a standard for any touch screen.\\n\\nOverall - if you are just going to use this for reading, browsing facebook, playing game apps you probably can't beat the value for the price. If you really want to browse the web and read web based articles etc, save yourself the frustration and buy a proper Google tablet.

I purchased these headphones on December 22, 2016 at a price of $69.99. The feedback I left then for the product was completely NEGATIVE, as I was completely disappointed with the volume being incredibly low (not being loud enough). I received a reply to my NEGATIVE post and Anker explained to me that these headphones were not designed for high volume. Ummm, what? I only expected them to be as loud as anything else that would normally plug into a headphone jack.\\n\\nI later received an email from Anker and was told that if I did not return my &#34;defective&#34; headphones to Amazon, that I would be sent a replacement set, free of charge, once the engineers fix the problem. So at that point, there was clear evidence and understanding that the problems had a limited volume issue! About a month later, I received the free replacement set as promised. To my surprise, I see that new ones are just like the originals; exact same model number. So being that I still had my original &#34;defective&#34; headphones, I plugged them into my phone and found a recommendation to download and install the Anker Play application, from the App Store. So I did that! The app told me to update the firmware/software on the headphones. Once that update completed, my original &#34;defective&#34; headphones were fixed and no longer had the volume-limited issue!\\n\\nOk so, I shouldn't be here complaining that I got two sets of now &#34;working&#34; headphones, for the price of one, right?

I bought this product (actually two of them) and am writing this of my own volition.\\n\\nThe good:  It is well made.  I mean REALLY well made.  Don't worry about hurting it if you drop it.  Your toes might be another matter.  It is almost a one man installation.  Remember, this product is made for the heavy plasma TVs, not the lightweight ones that are common.  It had all the hardware for installation in drywall OR mortar/bricks.  It was well packaged with decent instructions (not that you really need them).  It fit my pair of 60 inch Samsung TVs which have a BIG bolt pattern.  It has lots of other potential sizes/configurations for different makes/models of TVs that makes it a keeper as well.  Upgrade your TV and you might well be able to keep this awesome mount.  Money saved.  I found the price of just under 50 bucks to be VERY reasonable considering the weight (shipped free from Amazon) and the manufacturing quality. It is an articulating mount and moves left and right, up and down nicely with some considerable strength applied.  (No worries, any adult can handle it except someone very weak/frail)\\n\\nThe bad:  Well, almost nothing that matters.  But, there were two things of note.  One. If one grabs both sides of the TV and attempt to tilt it left side up right side down or vice versa, it does not articulate that way.  Other mounts I own actually do, but were not suitable for this TV.  This really isn't a problem for me, I much prefer my TV to be perfectly horizontal.  That is just a feature that it doesn't possess.  Two.  It is heavy.  Not two-man lift heavy, but heavy.\\n\\nLast point.  The best way to install this from my experience is to put the base on top of some scrap cardboard, draw a line around the frame, then fill in the dots/holes where the bolts go in the wall.  I used the mortar installation so had no need to find studs.\\n\\nGreat product and would buy again the instant I needed another.","[]","B00EDRX0VM","B00EDRX0VM","AG43Z4HNSNW5LMB54H4U6BROEWWQ","2017-01-01 21:37:55.000","3","True","500"

"41448","3","Great speaker, until it gets wet","I really wanted to love this speaker, and for the most part I do! it sounds great for what it is, a portable water proof/resistant speaker. The battery life i am sure is great but I have not had it long enough to test the 10 hr claim. I love the strap not being fabric so it wont get nasty with use. The build quality feels very good and I have no fears about it failing anytime soon.\\n\\nI own a number of Anker products from cables to flashlights, head phones and speakers. I have almost always had nothing but praise for their products and although I am giving this product a 3 star rating I do not feel like it is completely deserved since I love a lot about this little speaker.\\n\\nI specifically bought this speaker to be used in the shower thinking since its waterproof it will be much like the soundcore I own, just able to get wet. In fact the sound from both is different but not in a bad way exactly. They both sound great, the soundcore just has more bass and the sport sounds 'fuller' to my ears.\\n\\nI set it up in the shower, hanging it on a hook. The problem i have was once it got wet the sound gets noticeably muffled. If you blow into the grill it will 'unclog' the grill and sound fine again. So as long as you don't get it wet it sounds great but then whats the point of it being water proof if i have to keep it from water?\\n\\nAlso since I do not have direct contact with my phone while in the shower, the lack of track skipping ability turned out to be an issue. You can play/pause raise/lower volume and answer calls but thats about it. So just have the music you really want to hear ready to go.\\n\\nHaving said this, it's hard to fault the product since its billed as a sport speaker and not a shower speaker. If you view it by that perspective then these are probably not really issues at all. However I feel that many people are looking for a good solid speaker that can be used in the shower so I do want to speak to that.\\n\\nSo although its is not perfect for shower use in my opinion, I do love everything about the soundcore sport and if you can adjust your expectations accordingly this is a solid choice.","[]","B017JY0UTU","B017JY0UTU","AHFVR5KIFBZJPJ2MEH2ACVM2OXNQ","2017-10-25 22:54:06.900","4","True","500"
"76410","5","These are GREAT earbuds.","These wireless earbuds are SUPERB.  They wirelessly paired up easily with my laptop and several Windows- and Android-based cellphones I own.  The audio clarity is remarkable across a wide range of volume (Careful!  Loud is really LOUD with these earbuds!).  I listened to different channels on JazzRadio.com just to get a variety of high and low-pitched instruments playing together.  WOW, these buds reproduce everything from a thumping bass to a squealing blues harmonica or Hawaiian steel guitar just perfectly.  And the &#34;presence&#34; is remarkable; sounds like being in a room full of musicians; or should I say, like having a jazz joint strapped to your head.  The noise cancelling on these buds appears to be &#34;passive&#34; (noise isolating), not &#34;active&#34; (electronic noise-signal inversion and cancellation):  Just plug 'em in your ears more tightly to reduce outside noise.  This works fine for me while listening to music from my cellphone as I walk or jog along a noisy street.\\n\\nThese earbuds are comfortable on my ears, light-weight and unobtrusive feeling.  Volume up/down buttons work just fine, even with my large fingers.  In my experience, however, the forward/back skip function (longer depressions of the volume up/down buttons) does not seem to work with Amazon Music either online or offline.  Same for Pandora Radio.  Maybe it would work with iPhone / iTunes, which I have not tried.  This shortcoming is OK with me.\\n\\nTelephone-related functionality of the buttons on these earbuds works fine.  Telephone audio quality as heard in the earbuds is excellent; the called party says the audio quality on that end is &#34;satisfactory&#34;.\\n\\nThese Otium earbuds are a great buy!  I spent much more on other earbuds from Amazon that claimed to have active noise cancelling; I returned those earbuds when I found the noise cancelling to be non-working or ineffective.  These Otium earbuds work just as well as the returned models, for a lot less money.  I would strongly recommend them.","[]","B018APC4LE","B09S6ZWPS5","AGSGKFHF3FYQ4R5DMJKSSFU7YA6Q","2017-09-27 21:30:21.741","24","True","500"
"28152","5","Excellent Bluetooth headphones for commuting and light sports","In sum, I think these are pretty great Bluetooth headphones.  I used them for three weeks before writing this review, took them on two cross-country trips, used them daily on my morning and afternoon commutes (train), and compared them against two similar Bluetooth headphones that I also happen to own:  the popular [[ASIN:B01M3575QC Phaiser BHS-750]], and the somewhat less popular but supposedly high-end [[ASIN:B01EHIQASQ Jaybird - Freedom F5 In-Ear Wireless Headphones - Carbon]].  All headphones have their trade-offs, but I thought that the Creatives were the best - by far - for the following reasons (your mileage may vary):\\n\\n(1)  Nicely Balanced sound.  The Creative Outliers have a nicely balanced level of bass-mid-treble that sounds neutral on music, movies and speech.  By comparison, the Phaisers have such booming, punchy bass that it gets fatiguing to use them.  Worse, the rumbly bass emanating from the Phaisers is just unlistenable in audiobooks and podcasts even when I turn the 'equalizer' down to minimize the problem.\\n\\n(2) Great battery life, at least compared to most other Bluetooth headsets today.  The Creatives actually do last for much more than 5 hours - plenty long enough that I can use them for 2-3 typical days without needing to recharge.  The other models I've tried have trouble lasting through a single day of regular use, and just forget about long plane flights without a recharger in your pocket.\\n\\n(3) Good cable.  It's the right length - short enough not to get tangled up in my hood or collar, long enough to be comfortable.  The flat ribbon design prevents tangling, and they feel a lot tougher and more durable than the skinny thread connecting the Phaiser buds.\\n\\n(4) Nice fit.  The earbuds fit my ears very well, they isolate ambient sound pretty well (candidly, not as well as some regular wired headphones I've used over the years, but not to shabby), and they stay in place without falling out and without soreness even after long use.\\n\\nIn short, highly recommended.","[]","B01LS1TIXE","B01N6YGQLJ","AFEPPE5ZSR5LCCBJZWRSO7SFL5CQ","2017-03-30 15:02:13.000","1","False","500"
"341592","2","Poor auto white balance and over saturation on image","I work from home and do several video conferences per day, and I needed a separate camera that didn't point straight up my nose like the one on the laptop screen did.  I had high hopes for this camera based on the reviews.  I'm on a Mac, so you may have a different experience if you're on Windows.  When I got the camera, I noticed that it was HORRIBLE at auto white balance, and there was a LOT of saturation in bright areas (like on my face when I have the blinds open).  Even with the blinds closed, the backlight from my screens is enough to give me a washed out white glow.  These are problems I do not have with the built-in camera on my laptop, so clearly my lighting situation is not the problem.  I called Logitech support, and they said that with the latest OSX update (at the time in early 2015), there was a change in the driver which caused some of the automatic color/contrast/brightness/AWB to not work as well as it did in the past.  They recommended to adjust it manually with the Logitech Camera Settings app, and to wait for a future OSX update which would fix the problems.  It's been 2 years, and no updates have resolved this.  I can make manual changes with the Logitech app, but the settings are only in effect when the app is running.  Plus, when you start making manual adjustments, you have to always make them depending on how your lighting situation changes.\\n\\nOverall, I am not happy with this camera.  Lots of jokes on conference calls that I look like a ghost.  The image quality is horrible unless you make a bunch of manual adjustments.  I have to mess with those adjustments daily to get an image that looks at least somewhat decent.  Since I bought this camera TheWireCutter has come out with a review of the top cameras, and they hated this one.  They noted the exact same issues I encountered.  Their pick is the c920, one model below this one.  I was apprehensive to go with another Logitech camera after my experience with this one, however, the c920 seems to get better reviews than this one.  We'll find out when it arrives later today.\\n\\nI gave it two stars because it actually functions, but it has horrible image quality.","[]","B00CRJWW2G","B00WMM3ZC4","AH6525CTYP6GUBX37UVDTSJGIZWQ","2017-02-21 17:55:50.000","1","True","500"
"12119","5","So Far, So Good (**Updated 08/11/2017**)","I've bought expensive USB cable. I've bought cheap USB cables. I've had braided nylon USB cables that felt like they were taking your skin off you hand when they rubbed against you. Other than the braided cable every single cable I use to keep my bedroom tablet plugged in with has split, torn or ripped at the point just above the micro-USB plug end where the cable meets the plug (no, I don't, as I've been accused in the past, yank on the cord. I always use a firm grip on the plug.) Some last a month or two. My old white Kindle charging cable started flaking apart the same day I put it in use. I'd probably still be using the braided cable which hasn't failed but won't stay plugged in.\\nThey advertise that this cable lasts 10x longer and has a 5,000 bend lifespan. I've only had it a short while. There just under seventeen months left on the warranty. I'd honestly be ecstatic if it lasts that long. I'm tired of worrying about shorts or what might happen to the tablet if it goes from plugged to unplugged over and over. So, here's to hoping that this cable lasts as advertised.\\n\\nUpdate May 2nd 2017 -  Well, here we are a little over three months since I purchased this cable and although it has developed a permanent bend just past where it plugs into the tablet it show no cracking, no lightening of the covering which would show stressing. This has literally at just three months has doubled the average lifespan of my USB cables. This device which is plugged in 24/7 (unless I need to charge my eReader) gets used numerous times a day, it just doesn't sit there. I'm extremely happy with the durability of this cable.\\n\\nUpdate August 10th 2017 - I am amazed. No other cable has ever lasted as long as this Anker. I've had cables fail the same day, the same week and as I've mentioned it has developed a distinct bend from the way it hangs from my tablet, kept in the pocket of the grab bar on my bed, the cable shows almost imperceptible whitening just above the connector from strain but no cracks, splits or crumbling. It also stays firmly plugged into my Fire tablet and on occasion it's fine with my PaperWhite as well. Will certainly buy this brand again. Very impressive quality.","[]","B012VZ7MUM","B0BMQL6DMR","AFUSWNVA72MMWHGYWJ652SYX2JJQ","2017-02-06 04:02:29.000","2","True","500"

Half way through, it switched to a black screen with just the mouse cursor (which I could move). I had to hold the power button for &#62;30 seconds to get it to turn off. I restart the setup process and get further than before. It has 4gb of Windows updates to install. I sit for 30 minutes, then it fails the update process. I skip the updates, and get to finally login where I see it has created two different user profiles, saving the one from the first try at setup. I delete the extra profile, and install various software with help from Ninite. Reboot. Notice speakers aren't working. Can not detect any speaker hardware at all. Do driver/chipset/bios/windows updates. Restart. Fails to restart, gets stuck on the spinning restart symbol. Press power button, the screen turns off. Press it again, still the spinning restart.

"737020","2","Nice unit, but Amazon shipped wrong unit -- may have been the fault of their supplier","This tablet might be a good one for some people.  Unfortunately, Amazon had an error in the &#34;fine text&#34; of their listing, stating the unit was a 1077g model.  What was shipped was a 1065g.  I had purchased this unit for my wife, and among other planned uses, she wanted to use this as a GPS device.  The 1077g model from Proscan has a built-in GPS receiver.  Unfortunately, the 1065g model does not.  There is no way of knowing what model you actually are getting without enabling the tablet, since the model number is not included on any of the packaging or packing materials.\\n\\nTowards this end, you need to charge the tablet enough to get it to work, then open the settings APP and find the prompt that lets you see information about your tablet.  At this point, you can see the manufacturer's model number.  If it is not what you expected, you need to do some more research.\\n\\nSome manufacturers improve equipment on an on-going basis, and indicate this with changes in the model number.  A little research on the internet will help you determine if you actually got an improved product, or simply was shipped the wrong thing.  If you really want the GPS function (or any other feature) there are APPs that let you find out if they are present or working properly.  In the case of the GPS receiver, I used an app called GPS Checker (available on the Google APP store) to verify my non-existent GPS was actually either not present or not working properly.  Had this indicated that the GPS was working correctly, I would have suspected that the GPS APP I was trying to run was flakey.  However, the GPS Checker program indicated that a GPS unit was not installed.\\n\\nOther than this, the unit seemed to work fine and the included keyboard and case were convenient and were a nice feature.  Battery life seemed acceptable, and the WIFI connectivity seemed to be especially sensitive, compared even to some lap-top computers.\\n\\nBe forewarned that AMAZON's policies about electronic devices are relatively specific, and you might have to argue with them about a return or refund unless you are able to site a specific error in their description or the computer arrived dead on arrival.","[]","B00TKV0Z3W","B01JGW5VOM","AHV7HX2HEDP67RNVJQBDUR57ZQVQ","2017-02-01 03:17:07.000","1","False","500"

I also have an 8GB Sandisk 45MB/S which likewise, is still as strong as a porcelain bathtub. Being impressed enough with their SD cards I kicked it up a notch: I said &#34;SanDisk you've have done did me right all these years so far & I wanna ask yew, will yew be the brand of SSD I place all up in my desktop compooder as my OS boot drive?&#34;\\n4 years later she hums along with nary a peep.\\nSo, with our storied past I committed to this Sandisk card with its &#34;HUGE...trox of lond&#34;, often peering into it's cool grey label and toothsome red trim as it transferred files onto my desktop with the fluidity of a high noon humming bird. UNTIL the other day when I pulled the card out of my Canon 6D & upon inserting into my laptop discovered the plastic dividers between the gold contacts had fractured on one of the contacts, leaving me with a card full of staged video which I was only able to retrieve after haphazardly pressing the plastic back into place. The card will no longer slide into the camera and I'm left now w/o a high capacity SD card until I can get a replacement.\\nUntil this point, the card has performed flawlessly in capturing images and video; was also used in transferring large files between desktop & laptop.\\nOur time together was but 14 months.\\nI'm willing to accept that maybe this card was just a fluke, but Sandisk IS a brand name after all, and one would think that their QA would be a little better.

Well, this chromebook is no easier in that sense, I still have to google how to do things with it.  I bought this laptop because my sony windows laptop was 8 years old and barely functioning and I wanted something lightweight for travel, watching movies, online shopping and surfing the net as that's all I use my laptop for.  I did a fair amount of reading about chromebooks v windows laptops and decided to give this a try because I really like google products, I don't need my laptop to do much, and because it seemed to promise a more secure online presence (i.e., no anti-virus software required as it was built in).  It's OK, I don't use it much actually.  In fact I'm writing this review on another laptop.  The screen hurts my eyes more than other laptops (I've played with the settings and adjusted the brightness but it doesn't really help) and I'm not sure why.  The mousepad is super annoying - it doesn't seem to scroll very smoothly making surfing online and online shopping annoying.

I can also not figure out how to use my printer with it despite googling and trying various things.  I realize this was a $180 laptop so expectations need to be reasonable with regard to performance and functionality but had I to do it again, I would probably just pay more and get a regular windows laptop because for what I want to do (print, surf, watch offline movies, etc) it's not really doing it for me.","[]","B01APA662K","B01CZ5VKVA","AF5XOYXPI72ITUGGGLMBV2VWPCPA","2017-05-13 15:02:07.000","2","True","500"
"525643","5","Doing great job for me.","1st these were put into use the 1st week of Sept.2016 and it is now jan. 23rd 2017.  Two of the four cameras are just now needing new batteries.  I have found the picture quality set to mid range to be more than sufficient for my purposes, very good quality day or night. They are truly wire free, but you have to have some trade offs for that feature.  One being there is a lag time from initial motion detection to when the camera starts to record.  I have followed the company's suggestion and have two cameras at two different angels in each location.  I have two in the front if my home and two in the back. I have placed them so that motion will for the most part move horizontally across their path.  I have them set to record at 30 sec each and have found this to be more than sufficient to catch people or animals coming or going.  I understand that it can be an expensive proposition to need two cameras at each location, however if all you need are the possible entry points to to you home or location to be monitored I think these are just the ticket.  I really like the versatility of having zero wires the cameras can literally be placed anywhere within range of your WiFi ie in trees, on roof etc.. The cameras in front pretty much cover the whole front of my home the way I have them set up, and the same in the back. So I really do not need more than four.\\nFor those of you worried about storing the video on line, I really don't have an issue with that, as I do not need more than a weeks worth of footage anyway, and you can download any pertinent footage that you may need to your computer or phone for perminant storage. I do not have these cameras in any private areas as they are like any other internet based device susceptible to hacking.\\nTo sum up with proper placement, and conservative settings I get excellent quality footage with long battery life.  The phone app is easy to use.\\n Are they perfect, no, but nothing really is anyway.  If you need more extensive video coverage of your property or work, you will probably be happier with a wired system, it will be cheaper and you will be able to have more cameras.\\nFor my pouposes I really like these and they are doing a great job for me.

Example: &#34;Alexa; What is the core temperature of the Earth?&#34; Reply:&#34; Hmm, I'm not sure what you meant by that question&#34;  That is the canned response you get for everything. Of course it uses the BING search engine so right off that makes it a joke to use as Bing is a useless search engine.

Sure you can find 10000 commands online to talk to it, but when you really want to know something, it just doesn't have enough understanding.

I found out through researching the world of MYGIGs, that the three letter coding stands for the regional configuration of the HU, i.e. regional maps and language, therefore RHP stands for &#34;South Africa, Middle East &#34;GCC&#34;, Australia, and New Zealand&#34;. So basically all 735N units are similar in the design but different in the software content, at least this is my understanding.\\n\\nPrior to my purchase, I couldn't find any useful information about this particular version of MYGIG head unit (except for the regional info) and if the male plug will fit. So before ordering, I went ahead and removed the HU from my Jeep and took a picture of the rear end, then compared it with item picture of this harness and other versions of MYGIG, it looked to be matching. Then Went to the dealer ship and gave them my Jeep's VIN to make sure that the codes XAC (ParkView Rear Back-Up Camera) & 5ND (Mopar Headrest DVD) are available and configurable for my Jeep and they were :) So I've ordered this harness along side with a wide angle camera sold by Amazon (ASIN B00011KLV6), installed them and went to the dealer ship for activation. Couple of hours later, voil&agrave;!, I had a working rear view camera on my Jeep :)\\n\\nOnly problem I had with this harness, is that the male plug was very very hard to push into the HU, I looked at both ends (HU and Plug) and there was nothing wrong with them or at least I couldn't see any! Maybe I've got a bad tolerance on mine, who knows. Therefore I am giving it 4 stars, otherwise it would've been 5!\\n\\nHint, before installation, it won't hurt to protect the wires with some kind of wiring-loom.

The longest I had it running was a 3 hour stretch, the shortest time was 7 minutes.\\n\\nIt keeps dropping the connection to the ISP. There's no warning, suddenly the router unit lights up a lovely violet color, and every wi-fi connected device loses it's Internet connection.\\n\\nA couple of times just rebooting the router unit brought it back, but I had to reset and rerun setup on several occasions.\\n\\nThis stability, or lack of it, is the reason I unplugged it, and plugged my Google Wi-Fi mesh back in. It may not be as fast as the Orbi, but it's NEVER lost the Internet connection for any device.\\n\\nI really wanted to love the Orbi. I really, REALLY, did, but since one of the devices on our Wi-Fi network is a heart rate monitor that uses an Internet connection to upload it's data, I just can't have an unstable system in the house.\\n\\nI'm hoping a (yet another) firmware upgrade will resolve the problem, so my setup's not gone on eBay yet, but given that if you look on the Netgear forums this unstable connection has been reported, and reported, and reported, and IGNORED by Netgear for several months, I'm really not holding my breath, and nor should you.\\n\\nOne final note... in the survey email I was sent, if I click on one star, it takes me to a page that says &#34;thanks&#34;, and doesn't give me the option to write a review. So I went back and hit 5 stars, and lo and behold, it's letting me write this review (which I knocked down from 5 stars to 1 star), and then publish it to Amazon! :-). That kind of says it all about Netgear, doesn't it? I mean, if they didn't know there was a problem, you wouldn't think they'd prevent me from writing about it would you? Just something to think about, if you're considering purchasing an Orbi system.","[]","B01K4CZOBS","B0BT1BTW94","AH45N6RRDGORP5UWRWPXQKMAOYYA","2017-07-02 02:11:37.648","0","False","500"
"326972","5","Dell Optiplex 7010","First, I suspect, since there are a number of 'Certified Refurbished' brokers offering these machines, that the add for these machines is rather generic and somewhat fluid. It may be worth taking the time before ordering to check with the specific vendor to verify system specs.\\n\\nThe item I ordered was from Blair Technology Group. It is a Dell Optiplex 7010 in a desktop enclosure, not a small form factor machine - but that's OK for my purposes. It came with 16 GB of RAM, a 2 TB hard drive, and an Intel i5 - 3470 quad core CPU. Windows 10 was pre-installed on the hard drive. A USB connected keyboard and mouse were included in the shipment, they will gather dust in the closet.\\n\\nAfter opening the box I opened the unit to verify components, then zipped everything back up and plugged in an old 1280 x 1024 HP monitor via the VGA port. The machine came up on Win 10 quickly without any issues at all. After completing the personalization steps I checked various hardware components, in particular audio I/O. Everything worked. I shutdown the machine and then turned it back on, hit F12 to enter UEFI/BIOS mode and found the machine was set to 'Legacy' (BIOS mode) and non-secure boot. This configuration will work for most users - especially those that will bring up Win 10 for personal use and have no intention of doing any other major customization.\\n\\nI installed a GeForce GTX 710 card in the half height card slots (there are four in the desktop unlike the two in the SFF 7010). Connected both monitors, set the system to use UEFI and configured the boot devices to see an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS iso image on a USB drive. Installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on a spare 300 GB drive I had (pulling the 2 TB drive out of the machine - since it uses an MBR to boot it is kinda lost in the UEFI environment, it will be reused eventually).\\n\\nThis thing runs cleanly on Ubuntu 16.04 with a handful of USB hard drives connected and the video card installed. The memory is the biggest bonus since I run a photo editing tool written in Javascript (big memory hog). All in all I'm pleased. Easy to use right out of the box - easy to customize.","[]","B01LKOZEF0","B0C1CR7FN5","AGGWRPLL4TH7CEQRVF24MYVGIIGQ","2017-05-14 00:40:37.000","382","True","500"
"346716","3","Worked well for a while, but now will not pair with anything. Support is not helpful","Update to the update: Logitech, after about two months, finally sent me a new keyboard to replace the one I recycled. The new one works fine. It was frustrating dealing with the customer support people - who seemingly never read the support notes of a case - but at least, in the end, they stood behind their product with a replacement.\\n\\nUpdate: I tried to use this keyboard on my Asus tablet on a recent trip and for the life of me, could not get it to pair. I restarted the tablet multiple times and even removed and replaced the battery in the keyboard. I then tried to pair it to my phone, which it had paired to before but the doggone thing was simply not &#34;seen&#34; by my devices as available for pairing. This is not the first time that I've had issues with the keyboard - I had issues a year ago when trying to pair it to the same phone - it would tell me to enter a six digit pin code but it would time out before I could enter the digits OR it would tell me that I entered an incorrect pin code.\\n\\nI contacted Logitech's &#34;Support&#34; site but all I got was a run-around. They would tell me to reboot my device, or tell me to follow the instructions that I had repeatedly attempted. The latest response today was after they &#34;discussed with upper level support&#34; and was to try to pair it using the same basic setup instructions that I have tried dozens of times before. I give up... this baby is going in the recycling.\\n\\nOriginal review\\nI wanted to use a tablet instead of carrying my Chromebook on a trip to Europe and saw a TheSweetHome.com review of this keyboard. I loved the fact that you can quickly pair it with up to three different devices (not at the same time!) so I ordered it. It is a great size - small enough to fit into my smallish backpack - but not so small that my wrists ache after using it. It worked great on my trip and never got in my way, even though I was travelin' light!\\n\\nThere are several keys that simplify working with my Android tablet and Pixel phone. The quality of the board is excellent - well constructed  and the keystroke height is perfect for me.","[]","B0148NPH9I","B0BPN2DXC1","AF3MFCCZGVYV7XRSZMHOP4QM7L2Q","2017-05-22 18:12:03.000","2","True","500"
"939265","5","So far, so good! Improved speed!","Being a Dell owner for more than 14 years, when that machine finally died, I bought a brand new Dell Inspiron 5758 in November 2015.  The hard drive crashed in March 2016 under warranty, and then the Dell warranty replacement crashed in September 2016.  At that point, I bought two stock Seagate basic drives at a local electronics store -- one to use and one to keep on hand -- and the first crashed in December 2016.  The second of the two has been running for 7 months, but has gotten sluggish and we found drive errors (bad sectors) last week.\\n\\nAt the time of the December 2016 crash, I purchased the WD Black as our backup replacement drive.  I installed it yesterday, and the speed is noticeably better.than both the Dell drives (which I believe were Seagate) and the store-bought Seagate drives. Granted, the specs are better and it *should* be better than both of those drives, but some reviewers are saying it's not and/or not a noticeable difference.\\n\\nFor those wondering &#34;what the heck are they doing that their hard drives keep crashing?!&#34; ... this laptop sits on a desk all day.  It may be taken to a client's office once every few months.  It runs Windows 7 and MS Office, Adobe, and Corel programs mostly.  It runs maybe 12 hours most days, but it doesn't overheat.  No harsh treatment and not even any gaming.  We run &#34;checkup&#34; programs regularly. Dell claims it's fine and can't/won't tell us why it keeps crashing.\\n\\nWe backup files (robocopy) to our own cloud (NAS) and a WD external drive daily and run a system image on the first of every month. FYI: If a system image won't finish, it could be a sign of bad sectors -- run chkdsk [at your own risk] to confirm your file and drive integrity is in good order.  If your system is running slow, you should defrag and run chkdsk (which really should be run regularly), as well.\\n\\nIt's only been 24 hours, but so far, we're pleased with the speed. We'll check back in and let you know how many months we get out of this one. :)","[]","B01DOL05OC","B07TMRFS6V","AGQXPR5VE64IMVA7DY4JWGTV22VQ","2017-07-29 13:01:17.322","7","True","500"

This worked great for two years using Sandisk 64gb Fit drives.  They ran hot, but they worked.\\n\\nA few months back I decided to step up to the 128gb versions.  I bought 2 Sandisk 128gb Fit plugs, but they ran even hotter and started developing read errors.  That made me nervous so last week I stepped up to two Samsung 128gb fit plugs.\\n\\nAfter working ok for 24 hours, the first one failed with total data loss.  Thinking it might have been something I did, I tried to reformat it, but whenever I plugged it in, it completely froze my PC.  I managed to reformat it on another PC, this time to NTFS, thinking I'd sacrifice some speed for data integrity.  That took forever, and in the meantime, I quick-formatted my second Samsung 128gb plug to NTFS.\\n\\nI got that one up and running and did some tests copying a folder of portable utilities: IMO pretty typical mix of large and small files.  Here are the results:\\n\\nBad Samsung 128gb:  0.82 GB/s\\n&#34;Good&#34; Samsung 128gb:  1.89 GB/s\\nSandisk 64gb:  3.78 GB/s\\n\\nSending back both the Samsungs. The &#34;good&#34; one looks clearly better than bad one, but still no deal at half the throughput of the hot-running Sandisk 64gb, plus the lack of confidence due to potential data loss.  I wish there were a good 128gb plug on the market, but Sandisk seems to have withdrawn--not fixed--its 128gb version.  So it's back to 64gb :-(.  What has worked best for me is the [[ASIN:B00LFVIUGY Transcend 64GB JetFlash 710 USB 3.1/3.0 Flash Drive (TS64GJF710S)]] plug, but it's twice the price-per-throughput of the Sandisk 64gb plug :-(.","[]","B017DH3O5A","B0148N1COC","AG57GZNF2MVROBBRUZ2KFQO5HYFA","2017-08-04 20:22:33.146","4","True","500"

They should look at Wahoo – way easier and more functionality/flexibility\\n\\nApps: needs work.  I don’t snowboard, X-ski, etc.  But can’t kill these apps.  And tough to add simple workouts like “weight lifting”, “stretching”, etc.  I want to track this stuff but hard to get on the watch.  And worse on the app.\\n\\nGarmin should let this watch sync with more apps (like Wahoo, etc.).  They are treating it like the end product.

"916572","5","One of the least expensive options for a UPS with pure sine wave output - and you need a pure sine wave output","This is just about the cheapest UPS available that has a pure sine wave output. CyberPower makes one model with slightly less capacity for a bit less money, but there are tradeoffs to be made and everyone needs to decide how much they want to spend to keep working in a power outage. We already have large, commercial-grade UPS units from CyberPower to keep our router, ethernet hub and file server running for a few hours during a power outage. My wife can keep using her computer for a couple of hours if necessary. We even have enough capacity to continue recording a TV program, or to finish a streamed movie if we so choose. That's what you can get for around $800.\\n\\nFor my home office, however, I don't need anything close to that kind of capacity. I would like to be able to finish up what I'm doing, but primarily I just need enough time to save my work and to shut my computer down. After that, I can use my iPhone and my iPad, so long as the router remains up. The CP1000PFCLCD is perfect for that. It has enough capacity to power my computer, monitor, and external hard drive for 15-20 minutes during a power failure. The surge suppression and AVR features help to compensate for the power spikes, brown-outs and voltage fluctuations that are common in our apartment building in New York.\\n\\nIf you're reading this, you probably already know why you need a purchase sine wave output, but just in case you don't let me clarify. Most UPS units use a simulated sine wave, which is basically just a modified square wave. Instead of the voltage transitioning smoothly from positive to negative and back, it jumps abruptly from zero, to positive, to zero, to negative and so on. All but the cheapest computers are not designed to run on a simulated sine wave, and the prolonged zero-voltage phase can actually cause the power supply in your computer to think the power is off, and to shut the computer down. But preventing an abrupt shut-down is why you buy a UPS in the first place. A simulated sine wave is actually worse than nothing - it can do more harm than good for a decent computer setup. That includes virtually all Macs, BTW. In other words, spend the extra money and buy a UPS with simulated sine wave output, or buy nothing at all.","[]","B00429N192","B0B4QS4F25","AFTZQPNYD7CMMAREQSAQ7DSXEM3A","2017-10-09 05:07:18.420","2","True","500"
"285204","5","the Gumy Plus vs Granvela A8","I had another pair of earbuds die and decided no more expensive ones. I bought these and a few weeks later bought the bit more expensive Granvela A8, also very popular so this review will compare the two.\\nI have very large ear canals. Even the largest eartips supplied with many earbuds, do not fit well for me.Fit is one of the most important things when it comes to getting great sound.The largest tips supplied with these fit PERFECTLY. also very comfortable. I strongly believe in equalization, my Galaxy Note 4 comes with Soundalive software. if you have software to tailor the sound, use it and forget spending the big bucks on fancy earbuds that don't seem to last any longer then the cheap ones. These needed equalization to get them to sound great and as other reviews have stated, for the price they are FANTASTIC.\\nThe GranVela A8, are still cheap but also 4 times as much as these (depending on color) Their cord is replaceable, appear to be better made (only time will tell) and also sound fantastic but EXCEL at the Bass end. Not even with equalization are the Gumy going to give the almost subwoofer bass that the A8 do. With equalization , which they also need, you can bring the midrange up but the Gumy are better for vocal (my preference, I'm never turning the bass up). Also, if you are considering the A8 and have large ear canals expect to be looking elsewhere for eartips, all were too small for me. I used the eartips from the Gumy and the fit was again, perfect. Without the perfect fit all earbuds sound awful. With the perfect fit on the A8 using the Large Gumy Plus eartip, I had to turn the bass DOWN.\\nTo sum up, with my large ear canals, and liking bright speakers and vocal heavy music the Gumy Plus at their price, are a winner.\\nIf you want to spend a bit more for an equally impressive cheap set and you need your bass, the A8 are fantastic but both need equalization to sound really good.Also if you have large ear canals like me, you might not find a set of eartips with the A8, to be big enough in the box.Good Luck in your search !","[]","B005K925UO","B08TBYS1CT","AHGURUP65LAMNED2XNUB6U75N7BA","2017-06-25 02:10:03.031","0","False","500"
"439059","3","so the good - This screen protector comes with *way* more than ...","Okay, so the good - This screen protector comes with *way* more than I normally see for installation, to make it idiot proof. You get a couple of cleaning cloths, one wet and one dry. There's the standard microfiber cloth and the little card to help push bubbles to the sides. There's the sticky tape to pick up any remaining specks from your screen. And, there are these guide tabs, stickers you use to align the screen protector before peeling off the back.\\n\\nThe bad - The guide tabs aren't very sticky. It's probably by design to avoid leaving that sticky residue on your screen protector and the back of the tablet, but they don't have enough hold to stick to the screen protector. You're supposed to place the protector on the device and use the stickers to attach it so it's like a flip cover. Then you flip it over to the left, off of the device, and proceed with cleaning. The guide tabs almost fully pulled away from the protector, so I had to realign/clean some more to apply. When I peeled off the backing to attach the protector to my tablet, it *almost* went on perfectly. There's one tiny hair that got under it, which creates a bubble you can't get rid of. Peeling it up would only make it worse, since I'd leave oily residue on the bottom of the protector in the attempt to get that hair off. I tried using the tip I've read multiple times of running the shower while installing, so the steam would help settle anything in the air, and the install did almost go flawlessly. I think if I'd just taken the sticky tape to the protector's backing before peeling it off, it would've worked. Instead, the backing had that one little hair on it that fell on the protector when I removed it.\\n\\nSo, the failure's on me. I'm going to try using the protector as it is for a few days, and if it drives me nuts, I may order this product again. The kit's almost overkilling the cleaning prep, and I'm positive that I'd be able to avoid the little hairs with a second attempt. I do wish the guide tabs would have a little more hold, too. Screen protectors are annoying to apply in general, but I think it says good things about this particular one that I'd order it again despite my issue.","[]","B00U43F99A","B00U43F99A","AGR6OTLNW7XTPI3M2TQGALDGIO6Q","2017-12-12 00:12:56.350","2","True","500"

It's been going smoothly with my own playlist, and I have decided the skips with pandora/soundcloud are more due to a shaky LTE connection. However, I have decided to dock a star as there are other issues that have come up.\\n\\n- The fit is not the best for running-- with the plastic in-ear buds the headphones tend to slip out and come askew which is inconvenient. I've tried all the different sizes of buds that come with the product, but this issue persists. What makes this annoying is that the button to shut down the headphones is right where you need to readjust push the buds back into your ears.\\n\\n- There is an *extremely* annoying, loud beep that happens when you hit max/min volume. This beep is redundant-- I can figure out when I hit max/min volume on my own, I can set my own max volume on my phone, and I don't need a loud beep to know when I've muted! -- and it's harsh. I've asked customer service and apparently there's no way to disable this feature.\\n\\nAll in all, I'm unhappy with this product, and I'll be moving to a better-designed bluetooth set when I do more research. The only saving grace here is that this mistake didn't cost too much.\\n\\nOriginal review:\\n\\nBought these just to try them out, in preparation for upgrading to an iphone with no jack. Currently using these with a 6s.\\n\\nThe sound quality is fair-- basically what you pay for. I wasn't expecting anything astonishing. You do have to fiddle with the sound settings as the bass can sound very murky.\\n\\nThe battery life is very good, lasting multiple hour-long gym sessions from a full charge.\\n\\nHowever, the bluetooth connection is disappointing, with regular dips in quality. It's especially bad with pandora (although I have a basic plan, so maybe it's related to my LTE speed).\\n\\nI'll keep using it but I will probably upgrade to a higher quality set of wireless phones when I upgrade my phone.","[]","B019DB5QQ4","B019DB5QQ4","AGE3PD5PH2VWWGRPXWJRJMYZJEQA","2017-08-28 16:30:01.789","0","True","500"
"19202","5","Fashionable Headphones with Amazing Quality Sound","I purchased these headphones in white and pink – and I am in love with how they look on me! They stand out from any other pair of headphones that I’ve had so far. The (white and pink) design is very fashionable, feminine, sleek and modern.\\n\\nThe headphones are also very comfortable to wear. They have cushioning on the inside of the headphones all around, keeping both my ears and my head comfortable and allowing me to wear them for many hours. With other brands of headphones, my ears sometimes begin to hurt after wearing them for many hours. With these headphones, that is not the case. Wearing them feels like I have pillows on my ears.\\n\\nOf course, one of the most attractive features of these headphones is their Bluetooth capability. After holding the power button for a few seconds, the headphones turn on and allow me to sync my phone (or iPad, or any other Bluetooth device) to them. I had no problems syncing my iPhone to them, and I’ve been using them with my phone ever since. I play music from YouTube, Spotify and Soundcloud on my phone and listen with the headphones. The sound quality is incredibly good. With the headphones on, I hear the music crystal clearly and don’t hear much outside noise. Although they are not advertised as being noise cancelling, they are actually pretty comparable to a pair of noise-cancelling Bose headphones I received a few years ago – for one-fourth of the price.\\n\\nSo far, I have worn my Ghostek headphones to the gym, around my apartment, outside in a park and in my office. I have had no problems with the Bluetooth capability. It seems to have a good range.\\n\\nFor me, the best part about having these headphones is that I can listen to my own music and shows without disturbing my boyfriend (and vice versa). We live in a small studio apartment and when one of us is sleeping, it helps to have the other one of us use headphones.\\n\\nAside from the headphones themselves, the box also includes a carrying case for the headphones, an auxiliary cable (in case you don’t want to use the Bluetooth feature) and a charging cable.\\n\\nOverall, a solid pair of headphones for the price – with some amazing features and unique design.

"161268","2","No luck here...","Very troublesome device.\\n\\nRight out of the box, mid range bass hits (like the beat in Lorde's &#34;Royals&#34;) are &#34;pooty&#34;.  Not too dissimilar to how a dodgeball sounds when bouncing.  The poot distortion noise is significantly louder than the bass line should be, making it a huge ear-sore you cant ignore when the wrong song or movie comes on.  It also seems to mostly come from the front right of the system, which is making me wonder if my unit is defective.\\n\\nSecond, there is no video casting, despite the fact that chromecast hardware is almost the same price as Chromecast audio hardware, and this device has video out connections.  It really just comes off as cheap on Vizios part.  Sans a lack of compatibility with Google Home (supposedly coming soon), casting worked fine out of the box...that was until my soundbar updated its firmware.  One update later and it now takes ages to connect, and when it finally does the audio is filled with static, constantly drops, and the music plays slightly fast (higher pitched).  Pretty much made that feature useless.  I sent an email to Vizio support, so heres hoping its a bug.\\n\\nLastly, the system doesn't seems to be truly discreet.  Left and right channels mix, so if you were to hold the back *right* speaker up to your ear and send a signal to the back *left* channel, you will hear it just the same (even volume wise).  Oddly, there is still perceived separation when sitting between the two speakers, which leads me to believe they are using some sort of engineering cheat.  My guess is some sort of binaural offset, but I have no idea.  This holds true regardless of the signal I send through the line (DTS, Dolby Digital, etc).  All in all, not a huge deal breaker at the price, but for some this might be irritating.\\n\\nIf my &#34;pooting&#34; and casting issues end up being fixable, I would recommend this setup as otherwise the sound quality and features are excellent.  Unfortunately potential quality and effective quality are two different things, so I will be telling people to stay away for now.","[]","B01G3STJF4","B074K9KSZK","AFRK35VJJBUMFQA7QSYF7LEEV3UA","2017-02-10 22:10:19.000","3","True","500"

The noise cancelation is downright eerie: I can't even hear myself walking with these things on! Think about the booth you're in for a hearing test. Yeah, that. The Bose Connect app was recently updated to include an option to reduce the noise cancelation or turn it off altogether. It works better for constant, droning noise like a fan or engine... quick, sudden  sounds like a handclap would not allow the circuit enough time to cancel it.\\n\\nThe soundstage is fantastic, with rich acoustics and great dynamic range. I love that it can connect to two sources at the same time - I use it with my smartphone and my Envy laptop. Great headset, were it not for the problems, and I have two real problems with this headset. Well, one problem and one annoyance.\\n\\nThe annoyance is the female voice in the headset. Great gal in there...  but if something goes wrong, she's a total drama queen. If I'm connected to my laptop and put it in standby (or walk away), I get a voice of desperation gasping, &#34;Envy, lost! Envy, lost!&#34; When she says that, I picture Scarlett O'Hara, her hand to her forehead, ready to collapse onto a fainting sofa. Please, sweetheart, it's not lost! It's just in standby, really!\\n\\nThe problem, though, is the RANGE of the Bluetooth radio. I can't walk more than five feet away from my phone without the sound breaking up! In fact, the radio is in the right headphone cup and if my phone is in my left front pocket, it breaks up. That is BAD for a Bluetooth 4.x radio, Bose. Really bad. I should be able to walk 10-15 feet away without dropping connection.\\n\\nIf you want state of the art noise cancelation with great acoustics, and don't mind the voice that becomes an emotional wreck if a source disappears, then this is a great headset.\\n\\nHowever, I would expect a FAR better Bluetooth range for a headset this expensive. I recommend it, but with reservations. Bose really needs to fix that.","[]","B01E3SNO1G","B01EL7VTC0","AH4KV34TUKSAKGMLYTWDXTQFBBHQ","2017-07-08 19:04:47.111","10","True","500"
"124971","1","Almost a Great Product. (UPDATE: Issues continually get worse)","Was skeptical at first because of the lack of reviews, but this works great!  I didn't install the drivers as I didn't need the ctrl-shift feature.  Pressing scroll lock twice changes the display to the next active one.  Couldn't be happier.  I have only had it for a day so if things change I will update.\\n\\nUPDATE: Today I was using this to switch between two different devices which worked for about 2 weeks. After 6 hours today, both Windows 10 PCs said that they didn't recognize the device.  I tried unplugging the power, which did nothing.  At this point I have no idea what the power is for LOL!  I finally found a way to fix the issue by unplugging everything which finally reset the switch.  This sucks.  They need a reset button or a power button which you can use to reset it when this happens.  I am dropping my 5 stars to 3 and if this happens again I will be returning it.\\n\\nI also checked their website and the only way to contact them is by a form on their website.  They offer no support other than that.\\n\\nUPDATE 2017-12-17: It has been almost a year now and my KVM switch has become unusable,  At first I only had issues every month, but now it is EVERY DAY!  The monitors now turn off after only a few seconds.  I unplug everything and only plug in the HDMI for the monitor and one PC and still the monitor turns off within a minute.  After unplugging everything for 15 minutes, I can plug the devices back in and switch will work for a couple of hours before the switch stops working again.  I'm going to contact the company with the email address they provided in their response comment.  I will update this again on how it goes.\\n\\nI have noticed that there are many more KVM switches similar to this on Amazon now.  One of which has a switch.  So someone listened to what I had to say.  If my contact with this company doesn't go well, I'm going to buy the one with a switch here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M1GRZ1Q/ref=psdc_13983771_t2_B00MP2OOWG","[]","B00MP2OOWG","B00MP2OOWG","AEZIZRIQP3OYQN2UABI3XGZMKEZQ","2017-01-21 04:04:03.000","6","True","500"
"165043","3","Pay close attention","When I write up a review, I am honest, to the point, and it's not sugar coated.  So let's dive in to this R2.  Arrived quickly under prime.  Set up was fairly easy except the guide and the emailed updated guide from Amazon support won't help you.  You need to hardline this into your router, switch, etc for main set up.  You need to unplug it from the Ethernet cable to set up wifi, if you don't it will fail every time.  I had it connected by wifi for two days and both those days it would drop off the network and never return.  Had to reboot cam and set it up again.  Basically if your not connected via Ethernet, it's going to drop off.  I have run several tests to prove this.  Without listing them all, I will say if you need it to be wifi, find somehting else.  It's been running solid while connected by cable and it's much faster.  It is connected into an 8 port switch with an active Xfinity box for cable.  The two way audio has positives and negatives.  The speaker is clear and you can understand the audio coming in.  However the audio streamed back from the camera to you is garbled and horrible.  The IR works great for a completely dark room that's 28' x 15'.  The alerts for audio and video work fine.  The foscam cloud app needs a little work for recordings.  If you plan on this being the end all for inside home wifi security, think again.  I have used other wifi cams on different networks and found that they are not reliable.  There are options but for me wifi on a cam is not one for this particular unit, maybe for others.  I'm sure you will probably say &#34;maybe my wifi is problematic&#34;  I will say no as I currently stream 6 cams via wifi with not issues, and yes, I shut them down and took them off the network, when I tested the foscam. When I restarted my other cams, they all reconnected to the home network with no issue, the foscam did not.  The positive for this unit is its small, the video is clear, and its low cost.  I will try a few others as options to see who will win the wifi side of it.","[]","B01DJ1FTTS","B09YQXGDQ3","AEL23RAQ2KJ5MJPJCDMZ72GZ7AKA","2017-11-01 16:57:57.644","2","True","500"
"295801","2","I have a perfectly good BT speaker for $20 all I wanted was to ...","I bought the Dot to replace a Bluetooth speaker I have been using to listen to audiobooks. Unfortunately, it does not work well for this. The Dot’s speaker is just too quiet. If my furnace comes on I cannot hear the book, at the highest volume setting. My house is small (25’x25’), so I was never very far away from it.\\n\\nI contacted CS to see if it was a fault with the device and if I could get a replacement. I was told this was the normal volume and if I wanted more volume I would need to purchase a larger (and much more expensive) echo device.\\n\\nIt was also suggested, I pair my Bluetooth speaker with the Dot. The problem is, I purchased this device so I could listen to audiobooks while working around the house (including washing dishes) and be able to answer the phone (set cooking timers/pause when vacuuming) without having to touch it. If I pair the speaker and am downstairs away from the Dot, I would not be able to answer a call. I purchased a battery with the Dot to make it portable.\\n\\nI have a perfectly good BT speaker for $20 all I wanted was to be able to have the same sound, but with hands-off convenience. I paid about $80 for the Dot and the battery.  I think for $60 more than the BT speaker, hands off would be a reasonable expectation. Even just trying to hear the Dot tell me a daily news update, in a quiet room with the furnace running, is a challenge to hear. I am surprised, disappointed and frustrated Amazon put such a weak speaker in a potentially great device. I understand this device was not meant for playing loud music, but I think my expectation of being able to hear an audiobook while doing housework is not unreasonable. A larger Echo device makes no sense for my budget or for being able to easily carry it around. Also, purchasing multiple devices, so I can hear it in every room does not work for my budget. I can take my BT speaker outside when gardening too.\\n\\nI will say the Amazon CS rep was very kind and helpful. I was able to return the Dot. Most of the time, I am very happy with my Amazon experience. I hope in the near future Amazon will consider making a device that fits my needs.","[]","B01DFKC2SO","B01K8B8YA8","AFA7BTTZ4N7BS5EYCPLRTRTNEHRQ","2017-11-08 22:37:56.903","1","True","500"
"867518","3","Small problems add up to a return","First the good:\\nThese sound great, there isn't much to complain about the sound quality. In comparison to my QC35's, they are slightly better. The noise cancellation is basically the same in most situations, and the build quality is good. It's nice having a 3.5mm jack on each end, which wins points. The bluetooth connection handling, in my opinion, is better than the QC35 because I don't get constantly bombarded with voices reading out long device names. It's also nice to be able to turn off noise cancellation.\\n\\nHowever, there are some questionable design choices and unacceptable performance issues that made me return these cans. The gesture based controls are a pain in the ass and not too intuitive. I like to rest my hands on my headphones sometimes or reach to adjust, and that causes the MDR-1000x to perform random actions, including turning off playback, stopping music, and crazy stuff with volume. That's just poor design and I wish there were discreet physical buttons.\\n\\nThe earpads are uncomfortable in that I can't feel that they're there, so I always think they're not covering my ears when they are. They otherwise are less stick (if that's the right word) than Bose ones, so this is just a minor subjective quip.\\n\\nThe ambient noise passthrough is terrible and gimmicky. Sure, I can hear people talk when its on, but I can also hear people's feet scraping against the floor from 30 feet away, and the random small noises that are usually drowned out by background white noise are now noticeable.\\n\\nAnd now the dealbreaker:\\n\\nThe noise cancellation is good if you like not moving. In most cases, it has indistinguishable performance from my Bose headsets, except when I'm on the road. If there is even a slightly bumpy ride, the NC (mainly without music playing) goes insane and starts hissing obnoxiously in my ear. There was no way to remedy this, and since I'm trying to eliminate distractions, this is plainly unacceptable. How am I supposed to nap or enjoy music on a long bus ride while listening to highly compressed snake rap?\\n\\nI'm typically a Sony fan, so I'll be awaiting for when they return to physical controls and address this problem with their NC.","[]","B01N4BEKO1","B01N4BEKO1","AGMXBBOUSFSVRT7YZDPOWA6RH7NQ","2017-07-25 20:09:14.390","3","True","500"
"41763","5","I love it! Makes gaming much easier and less painful.","I've had this &#34;Gaming Keyboard&#34; since just before November of 2012, it's now just before June of 2017. So, for the lazy, that's about 4 years and 8 months. In that time, this has utterly revolutionized the way I play PC games.\\n\\nFirst, let's talk about why I bought this. I hate the QWERTY layout for anything other than typing actual words. It's not a design that lends itself to gaming, graphics editing, or anything other than typing. It's a key layout that was specifically designed to make typing words in the English language an intuitive and quick task. Gaming, on the other hand, often requires that you press the W and A or W and D keys all at the same time while you Dodge, Duck, Dip, Dive, and Dodge oncoming bullets in an effort to WIN. The standard QWERTY layout makes pressing &#34;Forward&#34; and &#34;Right&#34; painful for me. I've had arthritis since High School, and stretching my hand out in a weird contortion to press the W and D buttons and tossing a grenade all while jumping HURTS. Even with an ergonomic keyboard. So, typically I would use a gamepad to play a game instead of M&K. Needless to say, that wasn't always a good solution. Some games had way more inputs than the controllers did. Now-a-days, that's not such an issue, but 10 years ago? Ha!\\n\\nSo, why is this a good solution to the problem? The top two rows of keys are in perfect alignment to one another. That means that the default scheme for the keys, W is directly in front of S, and there is no strain of the tendons to press either A or D. Even better, there's a 4 point &#34;Joystick&#34; that can serve the function of WASD while letting all those other keys be slipped into stuff like:\\nInteract\\nReload\\nGrenade\\nCrouch\\nRun\\nJump\\nFlashlight\\nLeaderboards\\nTalk (via TeamSpeak or similar)\\nNext/Previous Weapon/Item\\nPower/Special 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.","[]","B001NEK2GE","B001NEK2GE","AEPPK537NYVNOPQDDJ5JC2U46MLQ","2017-05-28 07:55:52.000","1","True","500"
"491174","3","Great deal, but greatly disappointed!","I have very mixed feelings about this tablet. Let's keep in mind throughout this review that it is an $80 tablet, which on it's own is an amazing feature to begin with. To get this kind of technology and power for under $100 bucks is a great bargain. With that said though, it is ONLY an $80 dollar tablet.\\n\\nI was SO excited when I heard about the release of this product and pre-ordered it right away. My plan was to keep this device in my car, have it permanently connected via bluetooth to my vehicle's audio system. I planned to tether wifi from my phone to the tablet to allow it access to the internet, so I could use ALEXA. The one HUGE selling point of this tablet. You get ALEXA! I can now check the weather, play a specific song, album, artist, or even tell it to play a genre of any kind and it'll play automatically for me...in my car! I'm a huge fan of the Echo devices and have them in my home so when I found out this would be possible in my car I was all for it.\\n\\nNow, when does this review go wrong you might ask? Well, right now. The Alexa feature on this Fire 8 tablet is NOTHING like the Alexa feature on the Echo devices. Not only can you not wake the device by saying &#34;Alexa&#34;, you now have to press the power button, and hold down the home button to activate the Alexa feature. I thought to myself &#34;okay this isn't a deal breaker, I can put up with this since I still have the power of Alexa, it's just not as convenient&#34;....or so I thought. This version of Alexa does not support Spotify, along with a nest of other ESSENTIAL apps that make Alexa worthwhile.\\n\\nI'm really displeased with this device, and feel like I was mislead when I was told &#34;Amazon Fire 8 tablet coming soon, WITH ALEXA!!!!!&#34; when I logged onto Amazon that day. I plan to hang onto the device for a little while hoping that they'll put out a software update that will provide support for these issues. If not, I'll have no use for it and it's going to be my little 10 year old cousins new toy.","[]","B01J94SWWU","B01J94SWWU","AHQN3TLS6BPPILTMCXHGIMYX533A","2017-06-14 04:52:22.175","3","True","500"
"864664","5","Perfect for the geek couch potato!","I am enjoying the Logitech Harmony Companion very much. My setup consists of an Xbox, PC with a TV tuner, a Yamaha RX-V481, and a Samsung 4K TV. I programmed the Logitech Hub for the activities &#34;Play Xbox&#34;, &#34;Watch TV&#34;, and &#34;Listen to Music&#34;. Each activity turns on and configures the corresponding device (e.g., Play Xbox: turns on the TV, Receiver, and Xbox and configures the inputs for the TV and Receiver so that I can play). Later, I was able to connect the Logitech Hub with the Samsung Hub to control the lights as well. I can manually turn on/off the lights in the family room via using the remote control, but also I added the step to turn off the lights when starting an activity and it is dark.\\n\\nThere is one inconvenience that I have not been able to solve and it occurs when switching from one activity to another. When switching activities, all the steps to finish the first activity are executed before all the steps to start the new one. This means that if I am with Play Xbox and start Watch TV, then TV and Receiver turn off (ie. ending Play Xbox) to then turn back on (start Watch TV). This is a bit of annoying. It would be nice for the Logitech Hub to realize which devices are already on during one activity and leave them on when switching to the next.\\n\\nThe device was easy enough to install. It took some time to master all the possibilities for configuration, but you don't have to do it all right away. But even then, it was fun for me to go through all the screens and learn all the capabilities of the new toy. The user interface is very friendly and the web support is very comprehensive. It is easy to find out if a device is compatible with the Logitech Hub and how to configure it. This is a step I recommend one should do before committing to purchase. For example, I didn't want to find out that, say my receiver, was not controllable from the Hub. Search for &#34;Logitech Harmony Support&#34; with your favorite internet search engine to get to the site.\\n\\nGood luck and I hope that you enjoy the Logitech Hub as much as I do.","[]","B00N3RFC4G","B00O4RRHP6","AH3VH2STB42SL7U7SAFUVQ2KNHGQ","2017-02-17 16:17:45.000","2","True","500"
"834825","5","5★, works as expected, HOWEVER...","Here are some things I wish I had known up front.  It looks like development is improving rapidly, so I'm keeping it. (I'm pairing this with other parental control solutions to achieve a total solution for now.)\\n\\n• Shared devices: each device can only be assigned to one person - there's no good option if you have a desktop with multiple logins, e.g. kids &/or adults. An adult can manually reassign the device from person to person, but there's no set & forget. Circle documentation indicated that this would be improved soon.\\n\\n• the Circle Go app (a.k.a. MyCircle) on Android uses a *VPN*, which impacts *battery life*. iOS works differently.\\n\\n• only monitors one network name (SSID) - there seems to be a lot of confusion on this so - if you have multiple devices that have antennas AND you had to set more than one network name or *password* (even if you set them to the same password or no encryption) then you have multiple networks. A guest network counts as a different network.  If you only set a password one time, then you have an extender, 2G/5G, or a mesh network (like Google Wifi) and it will work as expected.\\n\\nAnyway, if you want to monitor cell data use, multiple access points, wifi use at a friend's house or school, or a guest network you have to adjust - or get the Circle Go app (MyCircle) now $5/mo (was recently $10). Mesh networks, 2G/5G, & Extenders (e.g. small devices you plug in the wall with antennas & no cables) are OK. It also does not monitor device usage for an offline game/app, phone calls, or texting.\\n\\n• 'Pause' is great, but I want to also set a time frame like 'Pause until 8:00' or 'for 2 hrs'.\\n\\n• No way to uninstall: since you don't have to install an app on the child's device (unless you use Circle Go), there's no way to uninstall this. That's *really good* because there are no extra restrictions on the device settings, and no special permissions are needed on the child's device.","[]","B019RC1EI8","B019RC1EI8","AE4SQ6J6ZWMEDI4RBG64FFQOAKPA","2017-09-29 12:32:43.267","1","False","500"

If it was $25 it could be worth it.\\n\\nEDIT: WITH PICS AND A VIDEO (sorry about the quality lol). I bought this June 28th, and stopped using it August 4th.\\nI've been using a different cooling pad the last week or so because this was blowing air that was hotter than my room temp! Got bored today and decided to open up this cooling pad to see how they had put it all together. I've used a couple other cooling pads in the past, this one is absolutely the worst. IT LASTED ABOUT 1 MONTH.\\n\\nIt does a good job for the 2 weeks or so, then, it basically slowly stops doing anything. I used compressed air to keep it &#34;clean&#34; and it seemed to work. The audio went out sometime during the first 2 weeks, used the speakers maybe twice, you could easily buy some $1 speakers from goodwill and they'd work better than these. The speaker outlets AREN'T EVEN SCREWED INTO THE BOARD ITSELF, they're floating just being held together by the board itself. They fall out upon opening.\\n\\nSO I ended up opening it up, and WOW, the shoddiness is almost unbelievable. The top of the board (where the bottom of your laptop is sitting) doesn't have any way to push any excess/hot air out, it can only flow through the bottom of the board. Well, the bottom of the board only has maybe 1/4 inch of clearance from whatever surface it's on, there isn't anything built into the board to rise/tilt it vertically, so it gets filthy and hot very fast. The top of the board gets very hot, which then makes whatever air its pushing out warm, defeating its purpose. Like I said, it works well for a VERY short time, it looks &#34;high end&#34;, but its anything but. ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE THIS IS NOT WORTH IT. Unless you plan on unscrewing 10+ screws weekly to clean the dust out and wiping everything down I would not recommend this junk to anyone!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817k+QdJAnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817k+QdJAnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817k+QdJAnL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EJDwGYG7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EJDwGYG7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EJDwGYG7L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81i-h50DNCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81i-h50DNCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81i-h50DNCL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yAcxSWU+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yAcxSWU+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yAcxSWU+L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01DZB4RT0","B01DZB4RT0","AEEER2ARUMBXSAM7RDAY2QWPT2IQ","2017-08-10 10:21:43.913","0","True","500"

Many will find that the inconvenience of the middle gap outweighs any ergonomic benefits. I have never seen a clear ergonomic benefit. The real problems with this &#34;wireless desktop&#34; are the mouse and the &#34;wireless.&#34;. It is infuriatingly erratic. The connection between mouse, keyboard, and dongle drops frequently, unpredictably, and for no apparent reason. It will not be because the batteries need replacing. It will be because of Microsoft's idiotic implementation of bluetooth. Over the years, I have had numerous bluetooth devices working with Mac computers and never had similar problems. (Mac has plenty of problems, this isn't one of them.) I often wonder whether Microsoft is even aware of what it is attaching its name to.\\n\\nOriginal review:\\nHorrendous... terrible Bluetooth implementation. Inches from my Windows laptop, it routinely stops working even though the batteries are good. You will find yourself thinking the batteries are dead. Maybe you'll replace them. And then it will die again. When? You'll never know. It's random. It's more fun that way! Interrupting your work flow to spend 5 minutes trying to identify why you can't type or click any more is exactly how you want to take a break from the daily desk grind . . . right?\\n\\nExtremely important: You should test-drive the keyboard. I cannot stress that enough. I did a lot of homework/research (I thought). I am more or less accustomed to the keyboard now, but it is a long miserable haul to get used to it. And I see no evidence at all that it is helpful for repetitive motion issues.\\n\\nAlso critical: You gain almost NOTHING through the Microsoft wireless keyboard and mouse being wireless. Why? You still have to eat up a USB port for the dongle. That is -- a small USB device (about the size of one of the really small flash drives) plugs into a free USB port for the mouse and keyboard to communicate through. Doesn't matter that you might already have Bluetooth on your computer.\\n\\nFinally, Microsoft support is non-existent. Microsoft's own operating system usually fails to recognize the company's own hardware.","[]","B00CYX54C0","B00CYX54C0","AGXB472G62SAAHXSTKZHEBBJZGXQ","2017-08-07 22:00:10.926","0","True","500"

The software is robust, the vendor updates it frequently (as they must; security is always a concern with these types of devices), Plex works quite well, and the included remote makes connecting to your TV a breeze.\\n\\nSetting up VPN connections is pretty straightforward too, provided you play into the entire QNAP SSL/DDNS environment (which is quite good, so why not)?\\n\\nHowever, there are a few gotchas:\\n-- Setup and adding disks is not easy.  It looks easy, but the software hides a few important details, and there is no wizard to walk you through the process.  You can set it up incorrectly, and you won't get what you want, you'll have to try again from scratch.  This should be much better.\\n\\n-- Identification of bad disks is an issue;  you'll get error messages, but no earthly way to figure out which disk it is, short of dropping to a command line.  The QNAP forums have many people complaining about this issue\\n\\n--If you want to transmit 4K content over the network to watch on your TV, you'll probably need 3 or 4 disks to get the transfer rates you need to support it\\n\\nThe biggest disappointment is the HDMI connection only supports standard definitions up to 1080p.  There is no option to go to 4K (2160p) and I suspect it's a hardware limitation.  This is a real shame as it makes this feel obsolete as introduced.\\n\\nBut overall it's a nice piece of work, provided you're willing to struggle a bit setting up disks.  Right now I have 3 10TB drives for 20TB of available storage, and it's a pretty solid performer.","[]","B015VNLGF8","B07STLVG75","AGE2J57IW3E5WNVAACAL2NVMGYJA","2017-12-30 21:04:58.288","2","False","500"
"22922","3","Not Worth the Extra Money!","I used to have the 290BT in my previous vehicle and I honestly never had any issues whatsoever with it. I knew that I wanted a Pioneer for my current vehicle so I decided to spend a bit more and go with this Model. All in all it's a pretty decent, reliable unit. There are a lot of extras on this unit that I didnt have on the 290BT but now that a few months have passed by I see that these extras are just a waste of money. Don't get me wtong. If you have use for Pandora, Spotify and Apps like that then this may be the unit for you. The Apps through the play store are absolutely Awful and it seems that there are no tech people from puoneeer monitoring these Apps and they have the ratings to prove that I am not alone with this opinion. I thought that it would be cool to use certain Apps and be able to view them through the radios screen. No luck there. I did my research and it's a pretty straight forward process but they never worked at all. So,- after trying many times to utilize this feature I finally gave up on it. Since,- that was one of the main reasons that I purchased this unit and it is not happening. The Bluetooth connectivity goes in and out sometimes but I have to be honest and say that this is not a lot and not enough to make me want to return the unit. Basically, the fact that I can view my backup camera while driving in the highway works great and this is another reason that I like Pioneer. It is good in the fact that the power of this model allows the &#34; decent speakers&#34; that I have to sound better than they would with the factory radio. In a Nutshell this unit is giving me the same functionality as the 290BT for almost $100 more. I would be happy with either one for what they do. And if I had to do it all over again I would switch back to the 290BT. It seemed a bit more stable as far as connectivity and gave me all of the functions that this Model does. So,- decide what you need before buying this Model. If it's just a good radio/ sound, Bluetooth and the backup camera function then I would go down a Model or two.

"72320","5","Great value","This is not a powerhouse. In fact, it's probably the least amount of bang you're going to get out of an Android at any size, but that's exactly what you are paying for. I found one on sale and got a great deal. If you can find one for $85 or less, you are getting a bargain. Pick up a 32 GB micro SD for around $15 or so and you have a very capable little tablet that makes a great reader that will fit in the pocket of carpenter jeans.\\n\\nYeah, I said &#34;reader&#34;. I wanted something for Google Books and I couldn't beat the price. You aren't going to be gaming on this rig and even web surfing takes patience. It's great for ebooks, tapping out an email, or light web browsing, but anything that requires speed or processing power is simply going to be beyond this tablet.\\n\\nNow, I can hear you saying, &#34;But he gave it 5 stars...&#34; And, yeah, you're right. I picked the &#34;I love it&#34; option, and I do. I love my little tablet. It's comfortable in my hands with the matching Moko case [[ASIN:B00ZZOIB3Y MoKo ASUS ZenPad C 7.0 Z170C Case - Premium Ultra Compact Protection Slim Lightweight Smart Shell Stand Cover Case for ASUS ZenPad Z170C 7&#34; Tablet 2015 Release, PURPLE]] folded into standing position and gripped in my left hand. It does everything I require of it and I am patient. If I need something right now or I need to fire off an email at the same speed I can text, then I grab my phone. When I want to relax with the Comixology app or a book, I like a bigger screen even if it is lower resolution. Reading comics or novels doesn't require a lot of snappiness to the interface so the tablet's rather sluggish pace is rarely a bother.\\n\\nAs I said, if you can get one on sale, do so. It's hard to find a less expensive tablet anywhere and ASUS makes good hardware. As of this writing, ASUS is still issuing security updates for this tablet, so even though you'll probably never see Oreo, you will at least have one less thing to worry about.","[]","B010FGJKWC","B010FGJKWC","AF6FY5KD3IN6YJLBFT6YIWPMXXAA","2017-08-25 23:08:18.687","2","True","500"
"24232","5","I started looking for a better way and found several monitor arms/stand and settled on ...","I ordered this monitor stand on my husband's account.  I work from home and need all the desk space I can get.  I bought a new monitor and unfortunately the monitor stand that came with it wasn't the height I was used to.  Anything I put under it would take up even more space (the monitor stand was round and took up a lot of real estate) and defeat the purpose.  I started looking for a better way and found several monitor arms/stand and settled on the Vivo because of the reviews AND the fact that when people had problems with the product, the seller would respond to try to resolve the problem.  Another product with the same amount of stars did not have that same support, so it was a no-brainer from there.\\n\\nWhen the package came I opened it and got it put together very quickly.  Someone mentioned that the gas arms can slap you in the face coming out of the package so I was wary of that.  I attached the stand to my desk and it was very sturdy.  The arm is so flexible I was able to lay my monitor down in front of it and bend the arm to where it was hovering flush with the back of the monitor.  This allowed me to put the screws (they include two kinds) into the back of the monitor easily.  When I pulled the monitor up to look at it and check out the height, etc, the arm would not hold position...I remembered that there is a way to adjust it so the arm would hold the monitor up.  It took a little strong arm action to turn the allen key and get the arm to &#34;pull&#34; the monitor up and stay still.  I thought i was going to break something because no one mentions how hard it is to turn.  I'm glad it's difficult, because if they didn't have it so tight, the arm may have slapped me in the face for real.\\n\\nThere is a warning tag on the monitor that says put the arm up high when you take the monitor off the arm because it can hit you in the jaw.  I left my warning on there just in case someone else takes my monitor off they don't get a surprise.\\nI would recommend this product to anyone, anytime.  It has solved a few problems for me (vision, desk space, flexibility).  Get one and be happy.","[]","B00EQ7HTG6","B00EQ7HTG6","AEAEKXHD4XTVHCAVOFERSVUMTYDA","2017-06-27 16:08:32.292","0","True","500"
"203226","5","New Fire is now more ""memorable"" with the memory card option!","I am getting accustomed to a narrower Kindle Fire, over my current one, which is about 4 years old.  I have taken my previous Fire all over the US and to many places in western Europe.  I love having it for downloaded library books, purchased books from Amazon.  Now I can download Netflix movies, and with the option of putting a memory card into the new Fire, I am set! I did have a bit of a confusing time (probably me) transferring my apps, etc from the old Fire to the new one.  I am not done completely yet; I may hit the &#34;on demand&#34; MayDay button on the Fire for assistance.  I just haven't had time yet.  The battery seems to last about 4 hours longer with the new Fire vs my previous one.  I bought an orange Fire case that will allow it to be horizontal for movies or &#34;portrait&#34; for reading.  I like the case; I thought I'd go with a new color for the new year, orange!  So, far, as I officially opened it up on Christmas morning (really, it was hard not to start using it.....) I really like the new Fire, like the optional memory card (I purchased at same time as Fire), like the battery life, getting used to the narrower profile of the actual device which does fit into a purse (my purses are a bit oversize, due to travel for work), and am looking forward to taking it to London for a 4 day trip in March (download movies as the airlines are cutting back on the movies in-flight).  The United flights I've been on recently replaced the video screen in the seat backs with an adjustable &#34;easel&#34; for lack of a better word.  The bottom &#34;shelf&#34; comes down and you clamp your device under the adjustable arm.  This frees up the tray to hold your food, drink, or whatever. The Fire works great in this &#34;easel&#34; (as do cell phones, etc.) but the best viewing experience is with the Fire in my opinion.  I plan to hand off my previous Kindle to my husband for when we travel by plane; I think he will enjoy it. My first Kindle is still going strong with a daughter, smaller size, good for the gym.","[]","B01ACEKAJY","B01BRWH8G8","AFZT64LFB5X6PBZK6DKELLNIHGLQ","2017-01-03 01:54:44.000","1","True","500"

Decided to go with this model due to its lower price, decent reviews, and Prime availability, which my old pair no longer have.\\n\\nPros:\\n-High quality stitched padding on band\\n-Great sound quality for the price\\n-Good cup size\\n-Detachable and replaceable 3.5mm cable\\n\\nCons:\\n-Plastic and adjustments are incredibly brittle, broke after only a few weeks of use\\n-Not very comfortable when worn for long periods\\n-Band is on the smaller side\\n-The 3.5mm port on the headphones is too small and awkwardly shaped\\n\\nOne of the main reasons I bought these was so I could continue using my wonderful Anker aux cable ([[ASIN:B00R124LAK Anker 3.5mm Premium Auxiliary Audio Cable (4ft / 1.2m) AUX Cable for Headphones, iPods, iPhones, iPads, Home / Car Stereos and More (Black)]]) that I had been using on my old pair, but that cable doesn't fit in the poorly designed 3.5 mm port. This forced me to use the lower quality included cable and would have made replacing it a big pain. However, the biggest reason I'm writing this negative review is that unfortunately, the plastic band that connects the headphones broke a week or so ago - I'll admit that I stepped on them, but I've had plenty of over-ear headphones survive much worse abuse, including my old Nakamichi's. They broke right in the middle of the band that goes on top of the head, which made the cups &#34;bow out&#34; too far and fit poorly. I taped them up and continued using them as best as I could. After a week or so of this, while trying to adjust one of the sides, it snapped clean off. The plastic these headphones are constructed of is very poor quality. I'm forced to throw them away after a little more than 3 weeks - I will not be purchasing again.","[]","B00QU6AV8E","B00QU6AV8E","AG3VXKOTX642C5LGWTKWBXDITJHQ","2017-08-06 00:49:08.612","1","True","500"
"598913","5","Best Tablet Under $100.","The exterior design is simple, not too minimalistic and pleasing to the eye. Its strong plastic frame has suffered no dents or scratches after a month of daily use. Volume controls and power button are sturdy with a satisfying click. Although advertisements are shown on the lock screen, they consist of high resolution images and sometimes beautiful animations. The display does not disappoint in comparison to an iPad mini with Retina display that I have owned before. It also has good brightness, so you can use this tablet outside. The CPU seems quite powerful - I can play demanding games like GOF2 and Sky Force Anniversary with high frame rates. However, battery life is this tablet's best attribute. With automatic brightness, I use mine heavily throughout the day starting before school at 7:00am , through all of my classes, on the way home and then at home for hours without needing a charge (48% charge remaining today and it's 8:30pm). The operating system is swift and works well with stock Android features, there are no glitches when (e.g.) trying to access a menu like Settings by tapping a link in Chrome. This is Fire OS but you can easily install the Google Play Store by downloading a few free APK files. All apps I've downloaded from Play Store function perfectly. The cameras on this device were skimped on, giving it a 2MP snapper on the rear and a VGA resolution selfie camera.  Audio quality is excellent and volume is loud so long as you are not expecting Bluetooth speaker loudness. 16GB version comes with 12.30 GB of usable storage which can be expanded via MicroSD card. Charging port is not C-type.\\n\\nPros:\\n12+ Hour Battery Life\\nPowerful Processor\\nQuick Network Capabilities\\nGood Display\\nAmazon Underground\\n16GB comes standard\\nDolby Atmos & Stereo Speakers\\nAmazon Alexa\\nStrong Plastic Casing\\nDurable Buttons\\nAffordable Price\\n\\nCons:\\nLow Spec Cameras\\nCustom OS (you can still get Google Play Store)\\nAds on lock screen\\n\\nOverall a great, honest product.

"253226","5","Very good value, some corners cut","I spent a long time trying to balance price vs performance for my Samsung Mixed Reality headset (which, by the way is awesome). I shopped around for a self build too. I could not get a better price point than this PC. It does the job really well except that the machine does not have Bluetooth and thus can't connect the controllers - I had to buy a Bluetooth dongle.\\n\\nI've another machine with a GTX1060 (3Mb) and the same Ram / Processor config. They perform pretty much the same in most practical tests, but this one is around $100 cheaper than an equivalent machine here on Amazon. I'm sure there are differences in the benchmark numbers, but I care about actual experience and see no noticeable difference. This one runs hotter, so the fans will kick in more often and they are fairly noisy - though not so noisy they are bothersome.\\n\\nThe supplied keyboard is &#34;OK&#34; while the mouse is &#34;OK+&#34;. Both a quite cheap in feel, but they do the job pretty well. My sons keyboard/mouse combo is much better but they cost $120 for the pair. These ones are essentially &#34;free&#34; given the price of the PC.\\n\\nThe PSU is not a named brand. I'm a little worried about that and will keep an eye on it, upgrading if necessary. I'll update this if I feel it's necessary with a drop to 4 stars as a result. For now I'll trust that CyberpowerPC have sourced a good PSU.\\n\\nMy complaints:\\n\\n1. the aforementioned lack of Bluetooth and thus the loss of a USB port\\n2. the Wifi is provided by a USB dongle. Not a problem as I run Ethernet to the machine, but you may need to use another USB port for it.\\n3. The case has an &#34;8th Gen&#34; core I5 sticker that has been applied crooked, it just looks untidy. Furthermore, it's Gen7 not Gen8 (which is as advertised. so it\\s only the sticker that is wrong)\\n\\nNone of these are concerns enough to knock of a star, but if I could give it 4.5 I would.","[]","B0767S8KCX","B0767S8KCX","AEKR3J42TFMBKYMHKBWBKLMH3FIQ","2017-12-03 06:49:36.185","6","True","500"
"340028","3","Very nice little system - But don't trust the bluetooth","Very nice little system. It's actually a little larger than I expected, but still compact. I use this in my office at work, so the volume stays fairly low but it sounds good. I am not an audiophile, but the sounds quality is entirely satisfactory for me. The Bluetooth connection works reliably with my iPad for streaming music from Amazon Prime and Sirius XM. It picks up FM radio pretty well, and I like that the FM antenna is actually a plug connection so I could theoretically upgrade to a better antenna if I needed to. CD player works fine although I don't use it much. The LED display is very easy to read.\\n\\nThere is only one reason I docked this system a star: The remote control is terrible. It functions perfectly well, I just mean the design is awful. First, it is a light grey color so it doesn't even match the system which is black. Secondly, the buttons are tiny (and I mean TINY!) and are difficult to read. Wouldn't you think the volume buttons would be fairly prominent on the remote control for a stereo? Not if you are Pioneer, apparently - they are tiny and the same size as all the other buttons.\\n\\nI still recommend this system - I wanted the Yamaha system, but got the Pioneer for literally half the cost from Amazon/Woot and so was a great value - but come on, Pioneer; the remote looks like a complete afterthought!\\n\\nUPDATE: I am dropping my rating by one star. After 2 years of use, the bluetooth just stopped working. Actually, for the past year the bluetooth had been flaky - randomly dropping connection and requiring deleting the connection and re-pairing with my iPad. But now, it does not connect at all any more. I've tried connecting to different devices (iPhone, etc.) to confirm the problem is with the stereo and not the mobile devices - it's definitely the stereo.\\nIt still sounds fine, so I added a Logitech bluetooth receiver plugged into the Audio In port so I can still stream audio over bluetooth connections. The Logitech receiver is much more reliable. Thank goodness the Pioneer has an Audio In port for this. FYI - I also tried a small USB bluetooth dongle plugged into the Pioneer's USB port, but it would not work, I guess the USB port does not have that capability.","[]","B01KU4AJ06","B01KU4AJ06","AFJPM5DWKELT2F2HN4VZAVVGUEZA","2017-09-12 17:54:01.480","3","False","500"
"664825","5","It just WORKS - Major Upgrade from AT&T's Equipment!","I purchased this modem for use with AT&T DSL service. We had struggled with our previous modem/router combo form AT&T, a Versatec/Netgear B90-755025-15. Ever since we received that modem/router, it had problems with dropping the wifi signal. Our DirecTV streaming service was unusable, as the router wouldn't maintain a signal for more than 15 minutes, and my newly purchased Windows 10 laptop was losing it's wifi signal about once every 30 minutes. I never could connect a Kindle to it, without power cycling the modem and standing literally next to it with my device. I was constantly rebooting the Versatec to get reconnected. I finally decided to replace that hunk of junk!\\n\\nI've been using the Actiontec DSL modem for a few days now, and I'm very happy with it. Not one loss of signal on any device so far. My Kindle connected from the opposite end of the house on the first try. We can now stream DirecTV without any buffering. All of our devices work, which include 3 iPhones, 2 laptops, an iPad, a desktop PC, a Kindle, 2 DirecTV boxes, 2 Chromecasts, and a an Amazon Fire Stick. We can use multiple devices at once without problems.\\n\\nThat being said, setup of this modem was not a breeze, but I attribute that in large part to AT&T, not the device itself. I had problems setting up this modem on an older desktop PC, so I switched to a new Windows 10 laptop and completed setup there. I had to call AT&T for help, as the provided instructions with the modem/router gave me an error message about the password. AT&T told me to instead go to the modem setup page (192.168.0.1). I got a prompt there to enter my username/password, which worked.\\n\\nAnother small issue you may have is with the length of the power cord. I wanted to set the modem on top of my desk, but the power cord would not reach. I managed to finagle a solution by moving my power strip.\\n\\nOverall, I would highly recommend this modem/router over anything that AT&T offers. We've had two modems from them that were absolute junk. This one works great!","[]","B004NBZ98K","B004NBZ98K","AFNW5WTOSWNXBXLDK5LB5M3TISSQ","2017-01-02 21:22:40.000","1","True","500"

There's a lot of features I like, such as the rotating base that let's you prop it up vertically or horizontally, and how cheap it is.  But that same rotating base makes for an insecure grip when holding it, and the material quality is REALLY cheap feeling.  The magnet also doesn't seem to align very well with the on/off sensor on the iPad.  It only reliably shuts off if you use the bungie strap (which I HATE on iPad cases).  Could do without the obnoxious pencil holder sticking out on the side too.\\n\\nI dunno... if it's on sale, it works well enough.  I'm still planning on picking up a Portenzo or Pad & Quill when they start offering iPad 2017 cases.\\n\\nUPDATE:  Well, it's been nearly two years, and my case finally fell apart.  But living with it for two years, and having bought another one (for whatever reason, Portenzo never offered a case for this particular iPad), I thought I'd give updated impressions...\\n\\nI'm on my second one of these cases for my 2-year old 5th-gen iPad.  The first was the black-and-brown leather version, and within a year it had started falling apart.  At around the second year mark, the leather had completely come off the plastic shell.\\n\\nBut I also paid roughly $12 for it.  My last ""real"" cover cost me close to a hundred.\\n\\nSo I bought another one of these.  I like the portfolio styling, I like how the plastic shell can swivel within the case, and I like the overall design and how well it sits upright for video watching/ Skyping/ etc....  The variety of appearances is nice too (especially since I seem to be having to replace them more frequently than I'm used to).\\n\\nIn short, it's a cheap, low quality case... but it has the best design of many I've seen, at a price that's just goofy hard to beat.  I mean, I loved my fake-book looking portfolio case made with bamboo and real leather I had before this, for my iPad 3... but I can buy TEN of these for the cost of that one.

I also have a Xiaomi MiBox and this firetv is terrible in comparison.\\n\\nComplaint 1. Why is there still no volume controller?!? This is running on Android, Android has system volume control, why isn't there one? The Android TV has it, why isn't there one here? If I want to use this device exclusively, I want just one remote instead of two. Not to mention Google Home allows you to turn on and off a TV using chromecast through CEC. Alexa still can't do this. With my MiBox, I don't ever have to touch my TV remote because 1. I don't need to control volume there 2. I don't need to use it to turn on TV 3. I don't need it to turn off TV. With the FireTV, I still need my TV remote for volume and to turn TV off.\\n\\nComplaint 2. FireTV user interface is a mess. Android TV is clean. FireTV pushes everything on to you. There really is no &#34;home screen feel&#34; because the home screen is how Amazon wants it to be, not you.\\n\\nComplaint 3. The alphabetical on-screen keyboard. Is this some kind of joke to you, Amazon? Unless you are a senior or have not had the privilege to own a computer, everyone knows how to type from a qwerty keyboard. Why do you use a keyboard laid out in alphabetical order. At least make it configurable.\\n\\nUpdate: So I've always been bothered by the fact that Amazon doesn't allow Chromecast on Prime Video, or that Prime Video app is not available on Android TV. I never knew whether it was Google restricting that from Amazon or Amazon refusing to support it. Now that Google has spilled the beans with this whole YouTube thing, Amazon doesn't deserve any ratings at all for this piece of garbage.\\n\\nOh, what the hell is with Silk Browser not available on FireTV 3.

I checked Task Manager while copying, and the 'Response Time' of the SSD explained it all.\\n\\nAlso, as you can see, while copying, in the pics tagged 'COPY', the SSD is going %100, and the HDD is like 36-70%, which is... not how it's supposed to be at all.. the SSD should be writing waaaaay faster than the HDD reads.\\n\\nAnd, as you can see, the copying speed was consistent around 116MB/s, which is low, it should be around 165MB/s (max HDD read speed).\\n\\nBut anyhow, when I tried reading the files of another game from origin (when you discover existing files of a game), the SSD gave me expected performance, as you can with pics tagged with 'ORIGIN INSTALL'. */","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61n0IQB9bKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61n0IQB9bKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61n0IQB9bKL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BQoDZ7+GL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BQoDZ7+GL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BQoDZ7+GL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ItUQ462RL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ItUQ462RL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ItUQ462RL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WFWjWAGhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WFWjWAGhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WFWjWAGhL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jZ7lyafQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jZ7lyafQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jZ7lyafQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814QhRrG0HL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814QhRrG0HL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814QhRrG0HL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CXg2JqY0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CXg2JqY0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CXg2JqY0L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81P2OSpXdaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81P2OSpXdaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81P2OSpXdaL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81f0dHO+UXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81f0dHO+UXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81f0dHO+UXL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91uPUknXqTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91uPUknXqTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91uPUknXqTL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B074ZL25J2","B075V17CG3","AGUYUVPFUSMDANDAGNXBYCXLIPIA","2017-11-10 18:19:14.779","2","True","500"
"52207","5","So far, it's been great!","I read a lot of mixed reviews on this bad boy and went back and forth on whether or not to purchase one for months. Finally, thanks to warehouse deals, I found and offer I just couldn't refuse and took the plunge. I've had it for about 2 weeks and I have to stay it's been great so far. Very stable and no issues whatsoever. The router I replace was also a very good router, and I only went the Starry route because of the additional information it provides at your fingertips. Perhaps the performance will slip as time goes on (which seems a common complaint from reviews I've read), which will cause me to alter this review at some point, but I have been very satisfied with the overall performance of the router thus far.\\n\\nIt's very nice to be able to see exactly what is connected to your Wi-Fi at all times, and see exactly how much bandwidth those devices are using (with the help of the Starry app). Also great to have a visual on how &#34;healthy&#34; your internet service is. So far mine has stayed in the 96 - 100% range, which I'm happy about. The Wi-Fi speed on both the 2.4 and 5 ghz networks has been fantastic so far and even slightly better than the router it replaced, which was pretty darn fast.\\n\\nFor those of you with kids, the ability to set &#34;lockdown&#34; windows for specific devices allows you to regulate exactly how much and when your kids have access to the internet. Nice feature for bed time, dinner, or to simply coax them outside for some fresh air.\\n\\nOverall, there is nothing negative I can say about Starry station so far. It's been great, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. As I mention, if that changes down the road, then I will certainly update this review.\\n\\nUpdate: going on 3 months now and Starry has operated flawlessly. Couldn't be more satisfied with the reliability or speed it has given me. Not sure what the problem is with all of these bad reviews, but it couldn't be a better purchase in my book!\\n\\nUpdate #2: coming up on the 2 year mark and the Starry is still working flawlessly. Again...couldn't be happier with the purchase.","[]","B019GRZSAO","B01N42IPAQ","AE5UDD4JRGZYLCUXUUFMPB5ZQRIQ","2017-07-16 17:20:57.506","1","True","500"

The voice control is good for video, but the response is too slow for pic, so you need to hold your smile for a while after voice command. I don't really care, since I don't usually use it in order to extend the battery life.\\n\\nHowever, the quality of this product is terrible. I am requesting my 4th right now, and it is the last chance I will give to this product.\\n1st one: card reader issue. I tried several cards, and randomly I would get SD card error and asked me to format the card. The issue can be fixed by taking card out and re-insert, or formating the card, but this is usually not an option when you are in the pool. Requested for replacement.\\n\\n2nd one: works fine for 3 weeks and I used it a lot on a trip to Hawaii. One day, after the charge, it is just dead w/o any reason. Can't turn on. Requested for replacement.\\n\\n3rd one: I tested it Day 1 I got it, no issue. Today card reader goes bad again. Requsted for 4th one, and last one.\\n\\nI tried all those cards on my canon 5d3, and none of them gave error there, so I think it is GoPro's issue.\\n\\nMy friend has a HERO5, and so far it is good.

"122423","5","This is quite possibly my favorite computing device I have ever owned","All through college I had been telling myself, I would like to try a chromebook, but I needed too many windows dependent programs for my engineering classes to justify the expense.  Now that I'm graduated, I wanted something to replace my Samsung Note Tablet which was starting to show its age after years of faithful service.  I decided that because I often found myself wanting to type when using my tablet, a 2 in 1 would be a good option for me.\\nI am so glad I took this plunge!\\nI use it every day.  It's light enough to carry pretty much every where.\\nIt starts up, runs without issues.  Not long ago, I replaced the hard drive in my Toshiba laptop with an SSD, and in regards to speed and general &#34;snappy&#34; feeling, there was as much of a difference between the SSD and this as there was in the SSD upgrade over the hard drive.\\nI love that I can let other people borrow my computer without compromising my privacy.  I also like taking it to work, logging into my managed G-Suite account and knowing that my work account can't &#34;see&#34; anything I do on my personal account.\\nI mostly use it for playing a couple of games, surfing the web, managing my calendar/tasks lists, reading e-books, that sort of thing.  Between being able to do a surprising amount with chrome extensions and being able to run android apps on it, there isn't much it hasn't been able to handle.  It plays nicely with nearly everything I have wanted to do.  I even use MightyText to get and send text messages with it.\\nThe keyboard is small, a little weird and takes some getting used to, but I find myself actually preferring to use it over other keyboards.  People preferring tablet mode may want to consider the Samsung Chromebook Plus or Pro because the screen dimensions are more tablet like, but since I find myself using it mostly in computer mode and like having the option of the tablet, I think this screen is beautiful.  The resolution is great.  Even the speakers are way better than I expected from a 2 in 1 at this price point.\\nI would recommend it highly to anyone who wants a light-weight device to use for work or play, especially if you can be flexible in the software that you use.","[]","B01N5G5PG2","B01N5G5PG2","AEAIO42QQAPASWZ7PWMS2JXAU7TA","2017-10-04 19:34:02.316","13","True","500"
"639919","4","Good performance doing what it is advertised to do.  Looks nice, but the design makes use a bit clunky.","if seems there is more than one product being reviewed here, so let me first start by explaining the product I am reviewing.\\n\\nIt is an Omars Micro SD Memory Card Reader Adapter with Lightning Connector.  It has a USB 3.0 plug on one side and a lightning adapter on the other.  It comes with no memory but accepts micro SD cards of up to 128 GB (per the manufacturer - I've only used 32 and 64GB).  The card DOES NOT stick out of the device when in use.\\n\\nI've used a number of similar devices and this one does exactly what it advertises it will do.\\n\\nFile transfer from a computer is fast (I copied 6 gigs of files in 3 minutes).\\n\\nWhen the lighting plug is connected to an iPhone or iPad (I used both) for the first time, the user is asked to download software from the app store.  The software is called Witstick. It allows one to backup contacts and upload them to another device or restore them.  I'm not sure this is useful as (i) the file it creates can't be read on a computer and (ii) with iCloud backup of contact information and sharing between devices is quite simple.\\n\\nAdditionally, the software allows for video playback, although not all file types. I had no issues with MKV, AVI nor MP4 but could not get DIVX files to play.\\n\\nOn the audio side I just tested MP3 files and they played fine.\\n\\nTransfer of photos is intuitive and easy.\\n\\nI was also able to copy PDFs to the stick and read them on my phone.\\n\\nThe downside to this is the design.  It looks nice and feels solid but is clunky to use.  I found the &#34;cross&#34; shape made it difficult to insert into my computer.  The problem is that the case does not lock into place when it is 90% from the plugs, and if one holds the case (as you sort of have to do if you don't have Trump hands) it moves as you are trying to insert it.\\n\\nOverall, this performed as I expected it should and worked well,. although I would like to see DIVX files work with it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Myu6ranKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Myu6ranKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Myu6ranKL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qtCA9daEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qtCA9daEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qtCA9daEL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yT15c3pbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yT15c3pbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yT15c3pbL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J4gca9cDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J4gca9cDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J4gca9cDL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QWdodOMXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QWdodOMXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QWdodOMXL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sm5vB7huL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sm5vB7huL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sm5vB7huL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vvz++02IL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vvz++02IL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vvz++02IL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]","B01KV93B9G","B01KV93B9G","AH5TSSJLJDBXZBDB2ID6Q45H627Q","2017-03-10 00:13:50.000","2","True","500"

GARBAGE COMPANY CUSTOMER SUPPORT RANDOMLY CANCELED MY CLOUD STORAGE PLAN WHEN I CONTACTED THEM THEY SAID OH WE DONT ONOW HOW IT CANCELED AND NOW PRICE IS LITERALLY DOUBLE. 11/10/2017 just got these cameras delivered today,I bought 4 and was setting up through my iPhone. Setup took about 5 minutes(some reviews saying it was difficult these people clearly don’t know how to plug something in and switch routers in your phone) super easy setup literally plug in and you have to switch routers in settings on phone,then switch back. The app will then search for however many cameras you said you were installing. And that’s it. App is very user friendly u get cloud storage for free it’s a 36 hours then recordings delete. If you want longer u have to pay. This is not an expensive system. If you want long term recordings but better off getting a nvr/dvr in Home. This is a great camera if you know what u r buying and what u need. I think if u want long term storage it will be expensive because u need to pay per camera. If you are looking for a good quality easy setup camera to monitor whatever it is then is great. No wires to run other then power. We have a pretty big house and I have no issues with cameras seeing my router. Obviously I have no long term review but I will update if I have any issues. This pic has a time stamp so you can see quality. Keep in mind when it’s uplaoded to amazon it’s not as clear. As of know I would recommend. I also have 2 other camera systems in my house one from alc which is being replaced by these (they are garbage). Hope this helps. Just understand what u r buying and what your needs are.UPDATE 11/20/17 have had for about a week and I absolutely love I bought four cameras only used my iPhone for setup and viewing. So I guess u say how good of a pic on a 5 inch screw. Well today I mirrored my phone onto my 65 inch tv and the camera looks great. I have no issues viewing or looking back at the motion from in Home or away.

"665021","5","Like entering a sonic cocoon - amazing!","My company recently moved to the dreaded &#34;open office&#34; environment and I quickly realized that I would need a way to avoid distractions and ambient noise levels.  I have other great headphones that do not have a noise cancelling feature, so I tried them out for a week first to mixed results.  I could still hear conversations in adjacent cubes, as well as the droning white noise that is pumped in through overhead speakers to dampen the ambient noise.  After much research, I took the plunge and ordered these.\\n\\nAll I can say is &#34;Wow!&#34;  I tried them on in my dining room the night they arrived.  &#34;Pretty cool,&#34; I thought to myself as I played around with the accompanying app and setting.  The real surprise was yet to come.  When I took them off to eat dinner, I became instantly aware of how much noise was being generated from the adjacent kitchen appliances.  And mind you, my appliances are pretty quiet, so the fact that I experienced such a stark contrast between wearing the headphones and taking them off was simply astonishing.  Even my wife, who is often unimpressed by gadgetry, shot a moment of wide eyed disbelief (followed of course by the obligatory - &#34;How much did they cost?&#34;).\\n\\nThe real test, of course, was when I brought them to the office.  As I sat down at my desk and connected the phone,  it was as if I suddenly entered a cocoon.  The droning was gone; the ambient chatter was gone.  Nothing existed except the work on my screens and the music streaming through my phone.  Speaking of music, they also sounded great.  I let a few co-workers try them on so I could see their reactions - they too were amazed by the sharp contrast (one even described it feeling a creepy sense of detachment).  I wore them for several hours in the morning before my first meeting, and I did not feel uncomfortable at any time as i pounded through my tasks for the day.\\n\\nI know this is just the first week of use, but I have to say I am thoroughly impressed and highly recommend these headphones for anyone that is trying to find a little corner of quiet in an open office, or while traveling.","[]","B01E3SNO3E","B01EL7VTC0","AHD4G6AD4SJAVQF425OYPX452JNQ","2017-06-30 01:33:11.070","1","True","500"
"817266","5","Has its flaws, but still totally worth it!","Two and a half years ago I bought this Kindle, and it's still going strong. Before this, I had a Nook, but it was rarely used. With as little as I cared for it, I don't know what possessed me to buy another E-reader, but I am seriously glad I did! I use this Kindle all the time, I literally ran out of memory I have so many books now. Amazon seriously needs to come out with another paperwhite with extra storage space for the of us with the most massive book collections. Seriously, I probably have over four thousand books at this point! The kindle however, holds closer to 1,500 to 2,000, depending on the size of the files.\\n\\nBuild: sturdy. It is a good weight in your hands, but not too heavy. very comfortable to hold.\\n\\nScreen: Bright and clear. Even if I get it dirty, it still looks good. The light in it is bright and even. Bright sunlight isn't a problem with this either, i've used it outdoors on multiple occasions and never had an issue. The touch screen is a little slow sometimes, but it works alright.\\n\\nNavigation: The older system I have is pretty easy to navigate. There was a mandatory upgrade a few years ago that changed things, but thankfully I don't have enough memory space on mine to get it. My mom's kindle did upload the new system, and I have to say that we both hate it. So for once i'm really glad that I have more e-books than my kindle can handle! It saved me some major aggravation!\\n\\nInternet browser: A word of advice - don't use it! Totally worthless. Use your computer instead.\\n\\nSpeed: a bit slow. Now i'm not sure, that may just be due to age and a full load of books, but it's not very quick. Even slower if you are connected to the internet. Ever so often it will &#34;refresh&#34; itself while you're reading or book surfing. It gets irritating, but thankfully it doesn't happen too often.\\n\\nOverall, the Kindle paperwhite is definitely worth the money. It has a few bugs, but with as much enjoyment this has brought me, I'm willing to overlook the few smaller issues.","[]","B00JG8H09Q","B00DOPNKLY","AG5LPE3P4LD2RDZH76KHP7FIRB3Q","2017-04-04 21:18:06.000","1","True","500"
