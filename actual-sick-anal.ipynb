         "I've used several zip tie guns at work. I tried to save a few bucks and bought a Harbor Freight gun and took it back the next day... junk. I used some that other guys had at work that cost $50.00 and $120.00. They worked awesome. I saw this with the Greenlee logo in the information so I took a chance. The free shipping also was a plus.\nSo here's my opinion... $18.00 is an excellent price. This tool is all metal and has a solid feel. How does it work? Very well. As a maintenance mechanic I often have to make a temporary repair using a zip tie or two... or three. This little gun cinches the zip tie tight (on the highest setting of 3) and snips of the end almost flush with the lock. I measured the cut end at .050 Inches with my micrometer. The minimal amount left is less than a 64th of an inch and it is smooth! No more tightening zip ties with pliers and cutting off with wire cutters that leave a sharp edge that can cut you wide open.\nThis is day one and I've used it several times and the rest of the crew had to try it out too so it's done at least 20 zip ties before lunch.\nIt does all sizes including the heavy duty 1/4 inch ties.\nHighly recommend this tool. If anything goes bad I will update this review. Just to be fair, i have not used it on the lower settings to wrap a bundle of cables or wires yet.\nI bought this from American Tools. I give them 5 stars too. Fast free 3 day shipping. It came in a padded envelope that fit in large slot in my locking mailbox. Happy with shipping, happy with the product.\n\nUPDATE 3/3/2018 I freaking LOVE this little tool. Iv'e used it hundreds of times and several coworkers have used on a lot of projects. The #3 (highest setting) tightens a 1/4&#34; Zip tie really tight. I used it to hold a sensor on a pneumatic cylinder until a proper stainless steel strap could be delivered. Saved 2 hours of down time. The machine ran with no problems and the sensor didn't move out of place even after 2,500 cycles.  On the lowest setting it works well for bundling delicate wires and hard plastic pneumatic tubing without damaging anything.",

         "First off lets look what I'm using this in:  A old Walmart &#34;box&#34; Dell Inspiron 560 computer (2009 era) with the Intel e5400 CPU; 10 Gig Ram, Win10 and stock 300 Watt power supply. This by NO means a powerhouse of a computer.  With the on-board graphics being only good for the most basic of games and videos, we moved to upgrade the video to a Nvidia GT 520 (2011 era). One of the limiting factors with video cards is the power supply in the computer having enough power. Back then the GT 520 fit the bill only requiring 300W. This card worked fine until games became more graphic heavy.\n\nPlaying what would be considered &#34;simple single and multi-player games&#34; with my son (he has a gaming computer) was more of a aggravation then enjoyment. Games like; Flight Simulator, Spin Tires, Euro Truck Simulator, Modern Warfare 2 (all on Steam) would suffer along on only the lowest of settings.\n\nWell this Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1050 has changed all that. Now these games are running smooth and quick. It's like having a whole new computer, even with the lacking &#34;CPU&#34; power. With the Video settings on High, I'm now &#34;booking&#34; on all my games and simulators!\n\nThe GTX 1050 requires only 300W power so no issues there. It does take the space of an extra slot in the back out your PC case, but does push right in to the board with no extra wiring. The fans are quite when the run.\n\nI currently run two monitors, one on HDMI and one with the DVI-D (using a converter to VGA). There is a DP (display port) connector for my third monitor Ill be getting soon.\n\nSo far the only lacking is the Utility Program - kinda slow to open but does have different settings you can play this like over-clocking, fan speed, etc.\n\nAll in all, this is a great card for the price and a perfect upgrade for a older computer.\n\n[[ASIN:B01MG0733A Gigabyte Geforce GTX 1050 2GB GDDR5 128 Bit PCI-E Graphic Card (GV-N1050OC-2GD)]]",

         "Nice universal mounting tech, decent keyboard, but keyboard/tablet slide around inside closed case.",
         "So the good news is that, unlike several other reviewers, I've had no problem with the keys repeating. The keyboard works beautifully, and while I'd prefer more of a slope instead of the totally flat layout, it's a good keyboard with decently-sized and well-spaced keys. Many of these sorts of keyboard cases give you tiny keys or are far too cramped for decent typing. The Universal Folio doesn't make those mistakes.\n\nGetting my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 into the folio wasn't a problem, and it does indeed hold the tablet in place firmly. The mounting tech is solid, easy to use, and seems reliable. Where I ran into trouble was when I went to close the case and found that it sort of slides around freely. Even with the elastic strap holding it closed, it's not a very secure closure.

         "I play too much Rocket League. I started on PS4, then moved to play on my iMac 5k. I wanted to play at 144hz, and also get a Windows machine for gaming, so I started looking into my options. I looked into Alienware but those would have been $500 more for the same specs with a sufficient power supply/cooling system. EVERYONE says &#34;build your own machine.&#34; I'm great with computers, work as a programmer, have upgraded and modified countless things on countless computers, but I've never built one from the ground up.\n\nWhen pricing out all of the parts as opposed to just buying the machine itself, I could have saved maybe $100. Seriously. And for that $100 I would have to do all of work, be responsible for any bricking issues, and order like 10 different things instead of one.\n\nI just wanted to play more Rocket League, so I decided to buy a pre-built machine. This computer was basically a custom-built PC that someone else with better wire management skills builds for you. All of the pre-built gaming machine companies get mixed reviews (Cyberpower, iBuyPower, etc), so I felt a bit risky, but I bought it anyway. I seriously could not be happier with the CyberpowerPC, and would 100% buy from them again.\n\nThe components themselves are top notch, it has a sufficient power supply and cooling system (which isn't common for the price point), runs almost all games on ultra settings, and will be super easy to upgrade once it starts getting dated. The packaging and box was almost Apple-like, high quality and easy to deal with. Everything is preinstalled (besides a few drivers I had to update) so it worked right out of the box with no issue. The LED lights are gimmicky but every gaming PC seems to have those.\n\nThe only complaint I've had so far is the headphone jack on the top of the case is wonky, super hard to plug in or take out a plug. I just got a USB headset instead and that solved the problem. Oh and the included keyboard is super loud because it's mechanical. But seriously, those two nitpicks don't matter at all.\n\nMaybe in the future I'll build a machine from the ground up for fun, but CyberPower 100% gets my recommendation.",

TV, soundbar and Apple TV are on wifi and the remote automatically found and added them.  Setting up the others simply required entering the model name/number.

Not a big deal at all, and volume can be controlled by either the Harmony or the Apple remote, so when using the Apple TV I don't really need the Harmony for anything other than to start the activity.  If you don't care about Siri, you could use the Harmony for all ATV functions.\n\nNote on placement:  my cable box and apple tv are in one section of a wood entertainment cabinet and the dvd player is in a separate section.  TV and soundbar are above the cabinet, with soundbar blocking the TV's remote sensor.  I put the included IR blaster in the section with Apple TV and cable box and it controls both easily, wherever it's placed.  The signal couldn't reach the DVD player in a separate part of the cabinet, but I put the hub (surprisingly small) on top of it - perfect.  I bought an extra IR mini blaster placed it on top of the soundbar, near the TV sensor and it controls both perfectly.  So my weird setup took a bit of time to figure out ideal placement, but this is not the fault of the Harmony.\n\nI also love the iOS app.  Although I agree it's not very intuitive, it's not hard to figure out.

         "My car does not have Bluetooth audio but it does have a very good stereo with an AUX input. I bought numerous small Bluetooth receivers to try to get something that was satisfactory. The biggest problem most of them had was that you had to press a button to turn them on after not being in the car for a while. Plus, many would not auto power on when hooked up to power. Some even did not work while charging. This is most annoying since I don't like clutter in the car and was hoping to install them under the dash and out of sight.\n\nThis HomeSpot receiver does not have those problems. It does not have a battery and turns on when power is supplied. It remembers the paired devices and just works. I get into the car and the pairing is done before I can shift into gear.\n\nAnother problem many of the devices had was poor audio quality - well, I should say subpar since they were good but not up to the level of the stereo or my good headphones. This receiver does a very good job. Maybe it is the power supply design or the fact it is nearly the latest in Bluetooth standard that makes it so good, but it really does a great job.\n\nFor a car or even home stereo setup, this is wonderful as once you do the first pairing, it just works every time. No more hassle. I was able to install this completely out of sight and in a permanent mount for a rattle free and clutter free car interior.\n\nI have not used the power adapter or the wires that come with the device as I have my own, perfectly sized connections and USB power source. (I recommend a good, isolated power source to prevent ground loops nod hum from the otherwise noisy car electrical environment.)\n\nI wish I would have found this one before having ordered and tried some many others.\n\nPS - This used to be available under a different product link at Amazon and I reviewed it there and now that link no longer includes the receiver (it was a product option).

         "My car does not have Bluetooth audio but it does have a very good stereo with an AUX input. I bought numerous small Bluetooth receivers to try to get something that was satisfactory. The biggest problem most of them had was that you had to press a button to turn them on after not being in the car for a while. Plus, many would not auto power on when hooked up to power. Some even did not work while charging. This is most annoying since I don't like clutter in the car and was hoping to install them under the dash and out of sight.\n\nThis HomeSpot receiver does not have those problems. It does not have a battery and turns on when power is supplied. It remembers the paired devices and just works. I get into the car and the pairing is done before I can shift into gear.\n\nAnother problem many of the devices had was poor audio quality - well, I should say subpar since they were good but not up to the level of the stereo or my good headphones. This receiver does a very good job. Maybe it is the power supply design or the fact it is nearly the latest in Bluetooth standard that makes it so good, but it really does a great job.\n\nFor a car or even home stereo setup, this is wonderful as once you do the first pairing, it just works every time. No more hassle. I was able to install this completely out of sight and in a permanent mount for a rattle free and clutter free car interior.\n\nI have not used the power adapter or the wires that come with the device as I have my own, perfectly sized connections and USB power source. (I recommend a good, isolated power source to prevent ground loops nod hum from the otherwise noisy car electrical environment.)\n\nI wish I would have found this one before having ordered and tried some many others.\n\nPS - This used to be available under a different product link at Amazon and I reviewed it there and now that link no longer includes the receiver (it was a product option).  This is the same receiver but a different bundle of accessories with it.\n\nhttps://smile.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22GGT471B5ZJJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MRI5OVQ",

         "Not a great mouse, but will do in a pinch and it's easy to travel with.\n\nThere is no dongle/receiver to worry about since this mouse is Bluetooth and depends on the host device already having Bluetooth capabilities.\n\nThe tracking of the mouse seems on par with any other good-quality mouse. It is not a super-high-rez gaming mouse but it is better than a lot of the cheaper travel mice on the market.\n\nThe unique things about this mouse are two-fold: the bending feature and the two-dimensional touch scrolling feature.\n\nThe bending feature is slick. It works as advertised and it is a fairly comfortable mouse to hold. That being said, the force require to push the buttons is optimized by having finger tips that are placed toward the front end of the mouse instead of being able to click anywhere on the touch surface.\n\nSpeaking of the touch surface, it does away with physically separate left and right buttons. Instead the mouse detects which side your finger is clicking with. This is confused a little bit if you have fingers resting on both sides which will default to a left click. This means that you need to make sure you're only clicking with one finger on the right side to get a proper response. There is no center button functionality.\n\nThe scrolling feature works but isn't implemented as well as some other touch scrolling devices like trackpads. The scrolling isn't always smooth and there is no inertial effect. There is also no haptic feedback on the scrolling feature like there was with previous models of the Arc Touch mouse. When compared to the scrolling performance of other premium input devices like the Apple Magic Mouse 2 or Magic Trackpad, the Surface Arc Mouse is inferior. Of course, this mouse is optimized for Windows while Apple's is optimized for Macs but the comparison is still possible.\n\nThe touch surface also lacks any support for gestures beyond the simple horizontal and vertical scrolling. This includes a lack of support for taps instead of clicks.This is unfortunate as the touch area is relatively large and could benefit from some additional capabilities.\n\nOverall, this mouse compliments the Microsoft Surface and other Windows systems fairly well and it's real selling points are its ability to collapse to an easily transported flat form factor and use of Bluetooth instead of a proprietary wireless dongle but don't expect the touch scrolling feature to blow you away.",

         "I've spent the last two days with the Echo Show, and am really happy with it. I know it'll get better as time goes on, but it's a bit rough around the edges right now.\n\n* Show to Show calling is quite nice - calling across the house and to my friend's house was done flawlessly. The video was at the quality of our Skype and Facetime conversations. But backlit rooms? Forget it - it's hard to see the other person (or for them to see you.)\n* The display is quite nice and playing videos from Amazon Video was easy but a bit awkward. The screen is as good as the entry level Fire tablet.\n* Having said that, there's no skills/apps that take advantage of the screen quite yet, so it's nice to look at but not really functional quite yet. I can show my photos from my Amazon account, and manually set wallpaper from the app on the phone, but the out of box experience might let you down.\n* The Alexa implementation for right now is a bit weak. For example, I can't say &#34;Alexa, play The Americans&#34; without it going to search for music. Same with looking up Youtube. That was a bit rough.\n* The speakers are amazing - I was kind of surprised at how good the quality was when playing music at full volume (sorry, neighbors) with no real distortion. It's no Bose speaker but it works.\n* Getting this to work as my bedside alarm clock is easy - you can say &#34;do not disturb&#34; when you're ready for bed, and you have to set the &#34;do not disturb&#34; time from the app if you want it scheduled.\n* There is a lot of nostalgia, especially if you had a Chumby or a Sony Dash.\n* There's no USB ports, so you can't use this to charge your phone. Makes sense.\n\nOverall I like it - this will take the place of the bedside Echo Dot while that gets repurposed around the house.

         "Just got them plus update",
         "Just giving 4 star because by selecting 4 star Amazon says that I like it and a 5 star says I love it. I literally just opened the package. It's very light weight, when I plug it in a red charging light comes on which is great. I hope that it turns green when it is fully charged. I got the different size rubber? tips (small, medium, large) and a set of one size foam tips. There are only three buttons on it. One for answering a phone call and two for volume. I'm hoping that maybe holding down a button will let me skip a song. I wear glasses and if I place the temples of my glasses (strange word for that part of them, google glasses anatomy) over the headphone thing that wraps around my ears it feels ok. I guess it might even help hold them against my head better. Will update after it charges.\n\nUPDATE: 16 days later\nThey work great, the bass is much better than I thought it was going to be. The LED light that turns red when charging turns blue when it is fully charged. If you double tap the volume up or volume down buttons the song skips forwards or backwards. the top phone button pauses and plays the song. There are other button combo options, but I don't have the manual in front of me. If you hold the volume up and down buttons together it will cycle through three types of EQ preferences. The only two I remember are treble and bass focused options. The charge holds for a long time, I haven't got a low battery yet. When you power up the headphones a woman's voice will say &#34;Power on battery high (if fully charged) and &#34;Power off&#34; if done again. I do a lot of physical work, so I sweat a lot, but the headphones stay clean and not grimy. They hold well on my head and I can still wear them well when one side is out of my ear. I can wear them without a problem on my neck, but when I am hot and sweaty I don't like them on there, but that's with anything. I am still very impressed with the quality.

         "The AUTO-VOX Cam1 HD Car Rear View Backup Camera was purchased to install on my truck, a 2006 Ford F-150 Lariat.  This camera was SUPER easy to install.  To give a basic run down of installation, here is all it took:\n1)  Take your license plate off, and bolt the camera to the back of the license plate.\n2)  Remove the tail light you prefer.  I did the driver's side tail light, since I knew the wiring on that side of the dash better.\n3)  Identify the positive and negative wires running to your reverse light.  Attach these two wires to your red and black wires on the camera.\n4)  Run the video cable along the bottom of the vehicle, ensuring that you zip tie or attach to the frame at non-moving or rubbing parts.\n5)  Find a place to pass into the cabin of the vehicle.  On my truck, there is a rubber grommet for other wires under the kick plate on the drivers side.\n6)  Running the video cable behind the kick panel on the driver's side, then up into the dash, the cable should be long enough to reach the stereo\n7)  On my truck, I am using a double din pioneer head unit.  Mine has a place to plug the video camera cable into the stereo.  If you don't have a head unit with video input, you will need to attach it to whatever monitor you have.\n8)  On my stereo, there is a purple wire that you attach to the red wire that comes from the camera.  Attach the two and make sure they are covered.\n9)  Done!\nMine is set to show the guide lines, but you can set it to turn off the guidelines if you prefer.  It is a super simple process of snipping one wire.\n\nThe image is really nice and clear, and uses a fish-eye so it shows a really large amount of image for such a small camera.  The camera is adjustable in all directions and uses a really sturdy bracket.\nMy plate has a decorative frame around it, and the bracket supports the camera over the decorative frame with no problem.\n\nAll in all, I am really happy with this camera.

         "I've been on a lookout for true wireless buds ever since they first got introduced, but all of the products out on the markets today had too many compromises. Whether it was battery, connectivity, or comfortability, I couldn't find any true wireless buds that checked all of the checkboxes I wanted; that is, until the IconX 2018. While the IconX does have its cons still, it was the best earbuds that matched up well with the Apple AirPods.\n\nThoughts:\n1) These have a 5 hour battery life with an extra 5 hours in the case itself; with my experience so far, I've had no issue reaching that mark. The issues with the old IconX was that it only had 1.5 hours in the buds, which was abysmal. Samsung finally fixed that issue here. Compared to the extra 24 hours that the AirPods get with their charger, these might not be as great, but a total of 10 hours on the IconX is perfectly fine with me.\n\n2) The fit on these buds are great. I have extremely small ear canals, and most in-ear earbuds hurt after some time. The IconX 2018 I can actually wear for 2-3 hours without feeling much discomfort. I might have to readjust them once in awhile, but I didn't feel the need to take a break from them once. They fit very securely too; whether running or lifting at the gym, I haven't once felt like they were going to fall off.\n\n3) These earbuds are very discreet. Unlike the other ones on the market (Bose and Apple, I'm looking at you), these buds don't stick out very prominently, which I really appreciate.\n\nCons:\nThe touch gestures are a little wonky and can register incorrect gestures. I've had moments where it wouldn't skip the song or where it would pause when I didn't want it to.\n\nThough it doesn't happen very often, there have been moments where the earbuds will disconnect for a second and reconnect to each other immediately. When this happens, there is a brief static noise when it reconnects and I've noticed it happening maybe once or twice every workout. I haven't owned any other true wireless buds, so this may be a connectivity issue with any true wireless buds, but I can't say for certain.",

         "I am coming off being a Magellan Roadmate user. It was fine, accurate, quick to indicate turns but Magellan stopped making good on it's promise to give lifetime free map upgrades, unless they meant the lifetime of a gnat. After nearly two years of no map upgrades and getting fed answers as 'this is the latest map and we haven't received the latest maps from our source' and then missing exits that were new but not on my maps I finally gave up and bought a new GPS. But not a Magellan. I got this Garmin Nuvi 57LM. It upgraded the maps the first time I ran its desktop software. The first few times I used the Garmin it compelled me to repeatedly agree to its terms of use, several layers of terms, in fact. Finally it settled down and now it only warns me not to input addresses while the car is in motion. The last time I didn't respond and after a few seconds it went to the home screen. The address input is natural. It asks for the street number then street name and then tries to guess what state and city your address is near. That is closer to how you write out an address. Magellan started off asking the city, street name then street number which always seemed backwards and sometimes I didn't immediately know what the city was. Garmin's navigation is accurate but it doesn't chime when you reach the turn like Magellan did. I miss that and it makes me have to look at the screen more to make sure I don't miss the turn. It has all the 'save addresses that are frequent' features and in a format that is easy to access. However, some off-road lanes do not show. The Magellan showed all the lanes and loop roads of the complex I live in but Garmin does not and so the car icon just floats in empty space till it reaches the satellite coordinates of the circle drive in front of the apartment complex I live in. All in all, I do think the Garmin was a good buy. I just wish it had some of the nicer touches of the Magellan. But, Hey, at least I've got a GPS with free map upgrades for the lifetime of a roach this time!\n\nSo, Magellan-I hope you are reading this! You have a great way of treating your customers so that they would never buy a Magellan again. I just hope Garmin is reading this also and tries to treat customers better so that they feel like returning as customers.",

         "I am coming off being a Magellan Roadmate user. It was fine, accurate, quick to indicate turns but Magellan stopped making good on it's promise to give lifetime free map upgrades, unless they meant the lifetime of a gnat. After nearly two years of no map upgrades and getting fed answers as 'this is the latest map and we haven't received the latest maps from our source' and then missing exits that were new but not on my maps I finally gave up and bought a new GPS. But not a Magellan. I got this Garmin Nuvi 57LM. It upgraded the maps the first time I ran its desktop software. The first few times I used the Garmin it compelled me to repeatedly agree to its terms of use, several layers of terms, in fact. Finally it settled down and now it only warns me not to input addresses while the car is in motion. The last time I didn't respond and after a few seconds it went to the home screen. The address input is natural. It asks for the street number then street name and then tries to guess what state and city your address is near. That is closer to how you write out an address. Magellan started off asking the city, street name then street number which always seemed backwards and sometimes I didn't immediately know what the city was. Garmin's navigation is accurate but it doesn't chime when you reach the turn like Magellan did. I miss that and it makes me have to look at the screen more to make sure I don't miss the turn. It has all the 'save addresses that are frequent' features and in a format that is easy to access. However, some off-road lanes do not show. The Magellan showed all the lanes and loop roads of the complex I live in but Garmin does not and so the car icon just floats in empty space till it reaches the satellite coordinates of the circle drive in front of the apartment complex I live in. All in all, I do think the Garmin was a good buy. I just wish it had some of the nicer touches of the Magellan. But, Hey, at least I've got a GPS with free map upgrades for the lifetime of a roach this time!\n\nSo, Magellan-I hope you are reading this! You have a great way of treating your customers so that they would never buy a Magellan again. I just hope Garmin is reading this also and tries to treat customers better so that they feel like returning as customers.",

         "As others has said, this cassette deck is not really what one would expect from a respected name like Marantz. Sure, it does play cassette tapes and can record to new cassettes (if you have any of those lying around). But the main reason I purchased this unit was to be able to play music from my ancient cassettes that have irreplaceable material from the past. (Yes, stuff recorded before most readers were born, back in the 70s and 80s). I realize that some of it is hardly &#34;audiophile&#34; quality, but it should still be listenable, right?\n\nThe problem with the PMD-300CP is that it severely limits you in terms of both noise reduction and playback bias. For example, you cannot select Dolby B or C noise reduction settings for cassettes originally recorded using these older technologies. I also was unable to specifically select the newer Dolby HX (although I don't have much material encoded this way). Similarly, in terms of playback bias, this machine does allow you to switch between &#34;Normal&#34; and &#34;CrO2&#34;, but I found neither sounded particularly clear or faithful to the originals. The unit also seems to be poorly constructed; one doesn't get the impression it will last very long because it is lightweight and has a cheap, &#34;plastic-y&#34; feel.\n\nIn fairness to Marantz, it has been a while since I listened to some of the cassette tapes I tried in the PMD-300CP and my ears might now be firmly accustomed to listening to fairly antiseptic &#34;digital&#34; sound. The system I now use to listen to music is significantly more accurate and powerful than the setup I proudly owned in my first apartment, and thus reveals more in terms of detail as well as flaws. But I have to share with any perspective buyer that if like me, you are purchasing the PMD-300CP to play your old cassette tapes, you are likely to be disappointed. You will probably not consider what you get out of this unit anything like what you remember hearing from your old hi-fi system.

         "It is light weight.  Also it is plastic, and feels like it is not made to take a drop and survive.\n\n The screen - The  contrast could be better.  This is not a high end screen, but it is good enough.\n\nThe sound -  just OK.  Even sitting 2 feet away the sound is just too limited.\n\nThe remote -  It works fine.  The remote takes a bit to  respond to your touch. It is good enough.  Also if you are sitting close  it may be just as easy to use the on board buttons.\n\nPoor quality - the laser skips parts of movies. Of course if you never saw the movie you do not know it skipped a scene.\n\nI do have a  larger 9.5 inch screen portable DVD player  that has a metal casing and is  louder.  It is also too heavy to slip into a back pack or tote.  This light weight player is easy to take along.\n\n  So  if you are wondering about  size of screen, it depends on what you want to use it for.  If you will not be taking it  with you  and you  like a larger screen  or want to  sit further away then  2 or 3 feet  the larger screen  seems a better choice.  If you want a lighter  player  to take along - this is light enough,  the 9,5 would be for many too large/heavy to take for commutes.\n\nIf you want a cheap player - this is it but  the frustration of  poor  audio and  the laser skips scenes may not be worth the savings.\nIf you want a  player that is reliable - better sound, responsive remote - you may want to consider a better built product\n\nI have not tried the flash and SD card.  I have not tested the 5 hour battery life.\n\nIt came with: DVD player, remote,  audio plugs,  AC plug,  DC adaptor for car, a game pad/control  You will need to buy 2 AAA batteries to use the remote.

         "Tough to beat at this price point, a very good mATX mini tower.",
         "This is a great budget mATX case. The internal layout is good, with a removable 3.5&#34; drive cage, dedicated mounts for two 2.5&#34; SSDs, decent cable management options and the ability to mount up to five 120mm cooling fans. The cabling for the front audio and USB ports are sleeved and have plenty of length to reach the far opposite corner of any mATX motherboard. The build quality is very good, although not perfect, no major complaints considering the price. The side panels could use ever so slightly thicker gauge steel and the 3.5 drive cage is a bit flimsy as well, but everything is perfectly functional. The front bezel is filtered from top to bottom and easily snaps out without any interference with the power button or front USB ports, making it easy to take outside and blow clean if any dust collects on the filter. The bottom vent for the PSU also has a removable filter, a nice touch for a case in this price range. I also really like the looks of the case as well... clean and simple but not boring... doesn't look like an alien cyborg egg that fell off a spaceship.\n\nI used this case for a budget gaming PC for the son of a friend, so it didn't have a ton of super high powered components. I added a 120mm fan to the front face, to add some positive air pressure to the case and to keep dust intake at the front panel where the filter will grab it. Using only the supplied rear exhaust fan might lead to dust being sucked in from gaps in the bottom and the vents on top. As far as GPU, my build used a smaller 1050ti but I believe this case would easily accept any dual-fan GPU. If you aren't using any 3.5&#34; drives, the cage can be removed to offer more room for cables / airflow. I left the cage installed in my build, using it as essentially a storage shed for the extra cables from the non-modular PSU. That said, the internal area seems roomy for mini tower and I never felt cramped working in the space.\n\nFor a mATX PC on a tight budget, you can do a whole lot worse than this case. I would easily recommend it. Thermaltake always seems to deliver on these inexpensive cases that aren't &#34;cheap&#34;. Great features and very good quality for the price.",

But that is good enough for me.\n\nI did use the AirPods for calls in my iPhone which worked great.  I used the Apollo 7's on my tablet watching TV, so I did not get to make a call with them so I can't speak to call quality.\n\nAfter research and purchasing a lot of headphones, I would say that the Apollo 7's are the only true competitor of the AirPods.  I would give the edge to the AirPods for their super ease of use and simplicity.  Apple just thinks of everything like if you decide to listen with only one earpiece, you can take one out it just shuts it off.  The Apollo makes you put both back in the case and take one out.  The AirPods never have fallen out of my ear on their own.  I have knocked them out taking a sweatshirt off or hitting them with my hand.  However, the Apollo's feel far more secure if you are exercising. If you are that anti apple person, you won't be disappointed if you can fork over the money for the Apollo's.

It appears that this area of construction could receive greater attention.\n\nThe pillow that is provided used as both a head pillow or can also be used as a lumbar pillow feels like it is filled with paper.  The pillow is very stiff, and provides little to no comfort when used as a head pillow or as the lumbar pillow.\n\nThe product is manufactured or assembled in China and opens the doors for concern.  The connection material used in the assembly of this chair such as the nuts and bolts as well as the rivets are known items of safety concern in the industry. Future buyers of this product might be wise to research other manufactures of this recliner further.\n\nCurb appeal of this chair does reflect sturdy construction.  It is only when reviewed that areas of concern appear.  Three (3) stars were issued mainly because of the issue with safety.  It appears that extended use of the recliner might generate further concerns, but presently the future use of the chair will only tell the bottom line of its construction.",

         "I bought the Tile Mate a little over a year ago as it had many good reviews and seemed to be the best product in its class.  Initially I thought it was a good purchase.  I was able to test the locator and had fun hiding the tile around the house and letting my daughters try to find it.  That is where the positives ended.  In order for a finder to work properly it should be reliable and react quickly to a request to find either the tile itself or the phone to which it is supposed to be connected.  A month or so after I had set up the tile and linked it to my phone I misplaced my keys.  I knew they were in the house but not exactly where, great I thought, this is exactly why I bought a tile.  I opened my phone and requested it to ring the tile in question, the phone gave me the little spinning wait indication and told me that my tile was nearby and was currently being connected to the phone.  After a minute or so of this I resumed my manual search and was finally able to locate my keys.  This scenario repeated itself several more times until I finally gave up and just removed the tile from my key chain.  The reverse action was also not useful.  When I had both the phone and the tile in my possession and had recently connected them and made sure they were talking properly I was able to push the button on the tile and my phone rang.  That is great but when I have actually misplaced my phone and am trying to locate it the results were not very useful.  I would walk around my house pushing the button on the tile hoping to hear my phone ringing.  Not once of the two or three times that I tried this did my phone ring.  I could be 5 feet away and push the button and no ring.  When I did locate my phone, reconnect the tile and then push the button the phone rang but that is not why I bought the device.  I don't need my phone to ring when I have both my phone and the tile in my hands I need the phone to ring when it is lost.\n\nI really wanted to like this device and my initial tests were positive but in the end this device does not do what I purchased it to do, locate my keys and/or my phone.  I am following reviews in hopes that other products or latter releases of this product increase dependability to the point where it can actually be used for its intended purpose.",

Then I discovered that it that the GPS mount causing the problem. the connection between the cam and the mount is very unstable, behaving as if the mount is unable to provide enough power to the cam until it shuts off and then power on again.

         "06/28/2017\nI updated my rating, changed from 3 to 4 stars. Even though I reported my hub failure after the warranty expired because it took me too long to determine it was the hub and not my laptop with the issue, Anker provided a 20% refund for buying a replacement product. I appreciate that. I ended up buying the newer 14 port hub since it has more ports AND the ports themselves are multi-functional now AND the 14 port hub is hot swappable while the 10 port apparently is not. I also appreciate that once I posted my review, Anker contacted us and offered a replacement for the 10 port hub.\n\nIt's kind of hard to increase my review to 5 stars though. Why? Because when I called they wouldn't cover the failed port since I took too long. I completely appreciate the great customer service, the 20% refund for my new purchase, and the post review replacement offer. I just wish they had simply offered the replacement before I wrote the review rather than the 20% refund. I don't know, maybe they did me a favor ... the 14 port will be better for what I need so I was destined to buy the replacement ... right?\n\n06/23/2017\nI chose the 7port USB 3.0 plus 3 Power IQ (10 port) because I use many peripherals, including a USB 3.0 external hard drive and an external optical drive with a power USB connector as well as a data USB connector.\n\nI purchased this on Amazon in September 2015 and it worked flawlessly for about a year.\n\nThen about a six months ago I began hearing the disconnect/connect sounds for the USB hub, with no system messages. Devices such as my USB headphones would then either stop working, or the sound would become severely distorted. If I disconnected the hub from my laptop, or unplugged the power, then reconnected, then ALL my devices were no longer recognized. I would have to re-start my laptop to &#34;fix&#34; the issue.\n\nThis week I now see the message &#34;Unknown USB Device needs more power than hub can provide.&#34; and the issues I already mentioned then manifest.\n\nI have trouble shot the laptop by uninstalling drivers and started fresh, but it appears my Anker will not survive any longer (:",

         "So I was originally going to buy the 1070 version. However, whenever I went to place my order they didn't have it in stock and wouldn't for a couple of weeks. Seeing as how i was building a Gaming rig from scratch, I just couldn't see having a tower sitting there for two weeks with no gaming capability at all. This popped up and at the time it was only $100 more than the 1070 I had saved in my cart. I'm glad amazon was out of stock now.\n\nI play some pretty graphic heavy games.(Ark, Metal gear solid TPP, Rainbow 6 Siege, just to name a few) and I had been playing on an asus laptop with a 970M GPU. I could barely play ark on a modified &#34;high&#34; setting. I had to lower several of the more detailed options manually. But this GPU... I have it running on epic with only &#34;Sky quality&#34; lowered to about half(and thats mainly because it can cause too much of a visual glare like looking into the sun) Now I haven't checked an actual FPS counter, But I can tell you I have no screen tearing, no lagging, no glitches! I run at 1920x1080 Borderless window mode and This thing can handle Ark with a breeze.\n\nUsing Asus Gpu Tweak II app found on their website I was able to create a custom profile using the base stock overclock preset and ramping up fan power that runs the GPU at 102%power at around 60 to 64 degree(Celsius) while playing Ark.\n\nWhen playing Rainbow 6 Siege with a friend, I ran the in game benchmark and was getting 250+FPS(not sure how accurate it is). It was quite impressive.\n\nAnd finally i use Uniging Heaven Benchmark to put a massive stress test on this GPU. I am happy to say that on the higest possible settings, It ran between 95-120 FPS without ANY Issues at all!\n\nI may buy a second and run SLI one day but for now, This graphics Card has NO DOWNSIDES!!!. The RGB lighting isn't overkill either. I have an Asus z270F motherboard and using the asus Aura app syncs all the RGB LEDs up flawlessly and easily I just can't say enough about this GPU.

I was told, don't worry, we will send you a check for the full value of the computer (over $2000) within 2-3 days. After 3 days I still hadn't received any check or advice on how to claim it.  I then emailed them and was told by Hasan, the Square Trade Care Specialist, who, as it turns out doesn't really care at all, that &#34;After reviewing your claim number 062178131139 I can see that, the case is already in the process of issuing you a check for the laptop price.&#34;  I received that gem from Hasan on 17 Feb.

That's right, the same bloody repair facility that didn't send the part or the technician. When I asked why they were waiting on the word of these subcontractors who were proven as unreliable, I was condescendingly told that I wasn't aware of their procedures and that someone would be in touch. If, despite my advice to not purchase this warranty, you still feel like going ahead, consider this:  I told Squaretrade that this is a computer that I run my home business from.  I repeatedly told them that I needed it to be repaired so I could keep up with my customers projects.  They simply DONT care that I am losing business over this.  Do yourself a favor and purchase the warranty elsewhere.  Anywhere but with these guys.  They'll just let you down when the chips are down.  Having had enough of the delay, I actually went ahead and had Fry's run a diagnostic check on my computer.  Turns out the motherboard is the problem, not the power supply.

Its now 27th of February and guess what....  still no check.  When I phoned them to ask where the hell it could be now, I was told they are waiting on the repair facility to contact them.  That's right, the same bloody repair facility that didn't send the part or the technician. When I asked why they were waiting on the word of these subcontractors who were proven as unreliable, I was condescendingly told that I wasn't aware of their procedures and that someone would be in touch. If, despite my advice to not purchase this warranty, you still feel like going ahead, consider this:  I told Squaretrade that this is a computer that I run my home business from.  I repeatedly told them that I needed it to be repaired so I could keep up with my customers projects.  They simply DONT care that I am losing business over this.  Do yourself a favor and purchase the warranty elsewhere.  Anywhere but with these guys.  They'll just let you down when the chips are down.  Having had enough of the delay, I actually went ahead and had Fry's run a diagnostic check on my computer.  Turns out the motherboard is the problem, not the power supply.  So even if they had turned up, they would have cocked up the repair anyway.  I would give these cowboys minus 5 stars if Amazon would let me.",

         "What a wonderful device! Well made, pretty and has so many features too. I bought the paired set SMH10-11 that had 2 different microphones because I wasn't sure which was best for my modular helmet. I ended up using the boom microphone on my Nolan N43 Trilogy helmet. The Sena headset comes with a wide selection of mounting accessories too. I installed the speakers easily but decided to install the extra speaker pads too so they were closer to my ears.  I'm using this primarily for communicating with other riders in my group. The units work wonderful for talking to each other and have a very long range. We paired the head sets to our cell phones and when we got out of Intercom Range, I voice dialed my friend and we could talk while we got close enough to use the intercom again. In my area, basically, if we can SEE each other, the intercom works and works well. When the Intercom Mode is enabled and on, you just talk back and forth like on a phone call, you can hear the other person talking while you talk, you don't have to wait for the other to stop talking first like a radio or walkie-talkie. I guess that's what Full-Duplex means. I'm not sure if all other headsets work like that but this one does. My Star Raider with straight Cobra Swept pipes and windshield is louder than his full dressed Spyder and while I did not hear any wind noise at all, my friend said he heard 'some wind noise' while I wasn't talking, but when I talked the noise went away. The headset paired perfectly with my iPhone 5C; the phone, SIRI and GPS all worked fine, which was a pleasant surprise. I hadn't tried listening to music yet so don't know how well the speakers perform in that manner, but all regular talking and communications were loud and clear. I'm able to ask Siri to text someone too, very cool. While in Intercom Mode and talking I received a phone call, took the call and when ended it went right back to Intercom. All very easy and not distracting at all while riding. We rode for about 4 hours and the battery was still &#34;full&#34; when I got home, I expect the stated 10-12 hours ride time will be correct. Initially we are very pleased with this Sena model and I'll update the review later after more experience, especially after pairing with more riders in the group.",

         "I am so happy with this bluetooth speaker! This JBL Flip 3 is one of the best purchases I have ever made! I grew up with old time amplifiers, turntables, and huge living room speakers, and have not heard anything I respect or like since then . . until now. THIS is the best music sound I have heard in many years (!!!Much!!! better than the Bose Sound Dock I bought a few years back).\n\nThis JBL speaker arrived last night. I got it connected to my Galaxy S7 via bluetooth and put it through it's paces with a variety of music - everything from Streisand to Zepplin. This thing is incredible! The fact that it is so small astounds me. The music sound quality is excellent. I mean it. It produces very smooth, very balanced, very rich response across the spectrum. No harshness, no boominess, no shrillness, no muffled tones. The sound is full and unbelievably rich. Nothing but really clean, balanced tones. My friend and I sat there with our jaws dropped open. Even subtle bass is incredibly warm, smooth, and rich - not boomy. Highs are very present, crisp, and clean - never shrill. Mids are beautifully balanced and clear.\n\nAnd, on top of it, no wires!!! I LOVE that I can just pick it up and move it wherever I want and it just keeps playing - and no wires all getting in the way. Oh, and my Android Galaxy S7 stayed paired with this speaker just from up to around maybe thirty feet away.\n\nAnd, it sits just fine on a flat surface and stays in place. There is no rolling or anything. When you set it down, you seem to intuitively feel that there is a &#34;sweet spot&#34; where it just likes to sit flat and stay put.\n\nThe size is smaller than I expected, too. It's maybe six o to seven inches long, and maybe three inches in diameter. And, it's got a little weight to it. It feels substantial and very well made. And, it blends into the background well without screaming attention to itself.\n\nThe one things that isn't good is the documentation that comes with it (or lack of docucmentation).

         "I purchased the Peplink Pepwave Surf On-The-Go Wi-Fi Router (SUS-AGN1) to use in a camper conversion. I want to use a Verizon PanTech 4G cellular modem and, when available, wifi hotspots. This little router does both without being overly complex.\nThis router (purchased 10/1/2017) came with the most recent firmware installed, but no user manual or even a quick setup sheet. There is a spec sheet and manual (.pdf) available on the support area of the peplink websie, but is doesn't reflect the most recent firmware. Not too bad since most of the functions are covered in the manual or fairly easy to understand; but it would be nice to have up-to-date documentation. Some things changed from a manual selection to &#34;AUTO&#34; and it would be helpful to understand the &#34;AUTO&#34; criteria.\nIt comes with a 120VAC-12VDC power supply, which is OK, but since it's named &#34;On-The-Go&#34; wouldn't a 12V plug/regulator be a good idea also? It's not like the thing was really inexpensive.\nSetup was easy once I got the manual, but the router takes a LONG time to boot up and find connections, and several minutes to change modes from cell to hotspots. Not a deal breaker, but inconvenient.\nThe 5dbi antenna does a good job of pulling in wifi signals from hotspots and campground networks, better than my laptop alone, and the rebroadcast coverage in the camper is excellent. It needs to be reconfigured for each new SSID, but different profiles can be saved so regular spots can be easily selected. Setup can be done with a laptop, but I use my tablet most of the time. Anything with a browser should work; just bookmark the admin page for easy access.\nWhen I'm using the 4G modem there is nothing to do but turn it on. With wifi, in addition to getting better range; being able to set all the devices to the router SSID/encryption, and then just reconfigure the router to the local hotspot info is nice.\nSo... great performance, out-of-date documentation, and long boot/change times add up to four stars.

         "This mouse is great! TL;DR - Buy this mouse if you have the money.",
         "This mouse is absolutely great.\n\nAs a person with slightly above average hand size, it is surprisingly difficult for me to find a good feeling mouse, as I use a claw grip when gaming most of the time. It fits my hand like a glove. I hardly ever have to adjust my hand when I reach for it. The ergonomics are spectacular.\n\nThe RGB LEDs are pretty color correct, although some lighter colors aren't quite as accurate. For most of my setups with my other RGBs, it does absolutely fine.\n\nThe Logitech Gaming software is phenomenal. It works exactly as you would expect, and is very responsive. It's what the Cue software with Corsair should have been.\n\nThe weight tuning is great. The mouse is fairly light without the weights, but once they are added it is a good weight. I would like if the weight was heavier fully loaded, but it's absolutely fine for me.\n\nAll of the buttons on the mouse are easily acceptable and are all programmable. The configuration is fine with me from stock, but it is easily changed for your individual needs. You can even add macros to each button as well!\n\nThe DPI sensitivity is insane. 200 dpi to 12000 dpi. You can set 5 individual levels of DPI according to your needs, all easily adjustable on the buttons of your choosing (from stock they are the buttons directly to the left of the primary mouse button). You can also include a DPI shift, which is accessed by holding the button where your thumb rests. It can be used to lower (although some use it to heighten) the DPI for more accurate (or faster, respectively) mouse movement depending on your needs.\n\nThe scroll wheel is also great. I was unaware of the usefulness of the feature until I received the product. It makes scrolling through long web pages or applications a breeze. Instead of restricting the mouse by making it &#34;click&#34; every so often, you can release the mouse wheel and allow it to spin freely. You can also use it normally, if you wish.\n\nThe mouse itself is very grippy, but not too rubberized as to promote sweaty hands or be uncomfortable.\n\nAll in all, if you have the money, buy this mouse. It is great for both gaming and productivity.",

         "I bought this adapter in an attempt to add a USB 3.0 port to my mid-2012 iMac (called &#34;model 12,2&#34; in About This Mac...), which has two Thunderbolt (1.0?) ports and only USB 2.0 ports.  Unfortunately, I quickly discovered that it requires OS 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion) or above, while I still run Snow Leopard (10.6.8).  I'm not crazy about any of the newer Mac OSes starting with 10.7.  The adapter is recognized by the Mac + Snow Leopard, as indicated by going into About This Mac and clicking on Thunderbolt.  However, that doesn't mean you'll get functionality out of it.  It just sits there like a bump on a log, refusing to acknowledge anything you plug into the USB 3.0 port. On a Mac, says Sonnet, there are no drivers to install; the assumption is that the OS already has them built in, but there are probably no such drivers included in Snow Leopard, which is 6-7 years old as I write this.\n\nIf you go to Sonnet's web page to find its specs (and yes, I regret not doing so before I bought it), you will see in red letters &#34;Product no longer available.&#34;  Nowhere but Amazon, apparently. Don't expect to see it listed much longer.\n\nThe good news is that it did not fry my new external SSD when I connected to it. Oh, and since you often see such questions raised, the flexible part of the cable is a mere 3.0&#34; long.\n\nI wish I could tell you that it works, or even that it doesn't work, but I don't know one way or the other.  Sonnet makes good stuff, so I expect it does work if you have the right operating system to support it.  How many stars to give it?  I chose three, only because of the incomplete Amazon listing.  Amazon should state in its product spec the two limitations I describe above, which would have warned me not to buy it for my particular iMac.  Strangely, I'll probably keep it in case I one day decide to bite the bullet and install a partition running Sierra or above. If/when I do that, I'll update this review and change the star rating accordingly.",

I read about complaints about the plastic giving out, and while there is a little bit of play once it's in the connector port (I have the USB-C version), the actually ball joint is very stiff and stable.  My friend has the Apple version, and surprisingly that one fit like a glove. There was practically no movement in the connection. It's still great in the USB-C version, but it did feel much better in Apple's lighting connector version. So in conclusion, the metal is great, but the plastic in the USB-C version is a little finicky, and I suspect with time, it may become loose. But mine is still going strong after 1 year!\n\nErgonomically this gadget works wonders. I often use it as a stand for my phone at work, and sometimes when I'm sitting and trying to watch a video, I'll place it in the horizontal tilt mode so I don't have to the phone in my hand. I absolutely love this setup because the 6P has forward facing speakers, and tripod provides the perfect tilt angle all without having to hold it at all. Furthermore, there is a small key chain mounting whole in the base so you can attach this to your key chain.\n\nLastly, if you're one of those people that constantly needs to do something with their hands, this is a nice key chain addition that will keep you occupied in addition to being useful.\n\nI did read some comments about this not being compatible with cases, and I agree, the clearance is very small. I've never used a case so it doesn't matter to me, but I know many people do so that might be a legitimate concern. I can't confirm the problem because I don't have any cases, but be aware of this.

         "Great noise canceling earbuds for the price!\n\nUsage:  I purchased these as I am frequently traveling by air, and I wanted to hear my movies and audio better in flight.  These things work great for earbud style headphones and they drastically reduce the ambient noise on airplanes, though there is still a bit of background hum from the engines and you will still hear loud talkers. I never fly without this headset!\n\nPros:\n- Active Noise Cancellation vs, Passive\n- They are good at noise reduction without having gigantic over the ear versions.\n- Powered by a single AAA battery that's easily replaceable when needed\n- Long usage time on single battery.\n- Comfortable fit inside the ear with multiple sized rubber tips to fit every ear canal\n- Volume control built in to the headset with a wheel so you don't need to mess with your device to turn it up or down.\n- Functional on/of slider switch to enable and disable noise canceling (You can still use them in the off position just with no noise cancellation)\n- If you purchase with the Blucoil extender (6'ft extension cable), it comes with a compact carry case with room for headset and spare batteries, just don't expect to fit the extension cable and the headset together.\n\nCons:\n-The inline battery, on/off switch and volume control are just long enough to clip to a belt or clothing, but can sometimes be a nuisance if you re-adjust your seated position or can get in the way if you are moving things around in your close proximity.\n-It's more of a Noise reduction than a noise canceling performance but I believe that's the nature of variable sound. Though the functionality is obviously working, the headset appears to struggle with certain ambient sounds or db levels. I had hoped that since the earbuds are essentially obstructing your ear canal with the fit, the results would be better as well.\n\nSummary:\nI love this headset and it is a staple in my luggage when traveling but often times its a bit constrictive to body movement. I think it could also be a little better at Cancellation but you can't beat the price for the quality. That being said, I have no intention on finding an alternate headset as these perform very nicely!",

         "Years back, I wanted a Bluetooth tape adapter..",
         "[update 6-Nov] A week later, it stopped raining and I took the car out for a Sunday drive. Three bad things happened that are making me think about just listening to the radio.\n\nFirst - more pairing/unpairing issues. Randomly unpairing in the middle of a song. A few minutes later I switched to radio and then back to the tape - a good 20 seconds or so until the tape adapter spun up and re-paired.\n\nSecond - if I would do anything to the phone (unlock, attempt to change volume on the phone), playback skipped. This is odd, as it has never happened while paired to factory Bluetooth on my other car (fwiw, 2015 Toyota).\n\nThird - audio quality, even though I did not actually touch the tape adapter, was far worse than the week before. Super tinny. Switching Dolby settings on the car's tape player, playing with the DSP/equalizer on the car, and equalizer on the phone - nothing really helped.\n\n[Original review]\nI recently bought a 15-year-old car with a CD changer and a tape player. It's 15 years old and I don't want to spend hundreds on retrofitting Bluetooth the proper way. I remember years back when Bluetooth was first becoming a thing how wonderful it would be if a Bluetooth tape adapter existed... now it does.\n\nAs other reviewers mentioned, you're well-served by taking the clear plastic film off of the play head. The sound isn't anything special - but it's better than I recall from other tape adapters and regular tapes. I had to set the volume on my phone to about 7/8 to get the best sound.\n\nA couple things are a little irritating. First - the packaging is that horrible clamshell plastic. Second - over the course of a couple days, I had pairing issues with my phone. Random unpairings, not pairing gracefully when starting the car, etc.\n\nAt the end of the day, it gets the job done, but it is still a bit of a hacky solution for older cars. The factory unit on my other car (model year 2015) is a relative dream - but the ION adapter allows my model year 2002 car to work for mid-length road trips where I might not have great radio reception.",

         "October 20 2017 UPDATE. I now have 2 SoundTouch 30's, 8 SoundTouch 20's, 1 SoundTouch 10 pair and a SoundTouch 130 Home Theater System. I purchased the first of them on July 28 2016. The 30 and the 20 are good quality MONO speakers (it's absurd you still can't turn the 20's and 30's into stereo pairs). I would give the 30 and 20 both 5 stars and the 10 2 stars as a stand alone speaker. This update is regarding the SoundTouch software. After using it for over a year and updating it with each new update I am beyond frustrated. The current version is 16.0.9 and it's the worst yet. With each new update they add some nice features but fail to make the speakers sync reliably. Most often I play together 1 30, 2 20's and my 10 stereo pair. Sometimes it will work well for 1-3 hours and then it's chaos - with speakers dropping out and the music speeding up and slowing down. The 10 is the biggest problem - sometimes I can turn off the 10 pair and it will work but other times it still won't work. Sometimes turning them all off and disconnecting/reconnecting bluetooth will solve the issue but other times it will not. This has always been a problem with the software but it's probably worse it's ever been with version 16.0.9. I have called Bose support many times. I called today and they told me their engineers are aware of the problem and are working on it. They have always been aware and working on it. If you're only playing one of the speakers it works pretty reliably.\n\nGood sound and good bass. I use it with Amazon Echo Dot. In my house I have 2 SoundTouch 30's, 3 SoundTouch 20's and 1 SoundTouch 10. They all sync well with occasional one-second dropouts. I use the SoundTouch 20's in my guest room bathroom (pictured) and in my master bathroom and in my smallest bedroom and it's great in those small rooms. For larger rooms I think it's well worth it to go up to the SoundTouch 30. I like my music loud and with a lot of bass - if you don't you'll probably be happy with the SoundTouch 20 even in large rooms.\n\n(The only thing I use the SoundTouch 10 for is some music right in front of me in a large room where I also have a SoundTouch 30.)",

         "This is a versatile tablet that works very well for personal and business use. The halo keys work very well and I've taken several hours of meeting notes this way and it is so small, sleek and compact that it isn't obtrusive at all and with the halo keys, it is silent unlike a laptop would be. The keyboard is a bit small but I am getting used to it. The halo keyboard is also nice to have as when it is flipped in tablet mode, no keys are sticking out and the keyboard &#34;shuts off&#34; so you don't have to worry about accidental key presses.\n\nIt is extremely fast and responsive and the screen is superb. I love watching HD videos on it as the screen is nice and clear and sound is really good for its size though I usually use headphones. An added bonus is it can be use as a traditional tablet, opened like a laptop, or in tent mode. I've used all 3 depending on what I am doing so its a nice option to have. The battery life is very good for a tablet of this size and I have no problem getting through the day with it at work. The screen and size of the tablet seems to work quite well. The only benefit of wishing it was a bit bigger would be to have a larger halo keyboard, but not a huge issue for me.\n\nI haven't used the pad for my notes much as I prefer to type my notes, but when I did try it out, it did work out quite well. I'm just more of a typist, so just not something I would use much, but is a nice feature that works well if that is your preference. I also used the stylus in tablet mode and that worked very well. Response was good as was using my finger. They did a nice job with this touch screen.\n\nIf you need more space you can add a micro SD card to increase the capacity beyond the 64GB. Not an issue for me yet as it is new, but nice to have the option or if you want to store a lot of pictures, music, etc... I do plan to take this on vacation with me instead of my big clunky laptop so might pop a card in before then to store some videos to watch or to store pictures.\n\nOverall this is a fantastic device that I would recommend for personal use, business use, or a mix of both.",

         "First, I was very happy but later, very sad.  The H.265 HEVC decoding is very efficient.  HDR algorithms work very well, no artifacts, menus are ugly but work.  Small but practical remote control, I was a happy.\n\nThen I decided to compare the H.264 decoding using another H.264 decoder that I am quite familiar with:  Playstation 3.  The first thing you will notice is less detail, which makes us think about the quality of the H.264 decoder in this player.  Less detail translates into a less efficient decoder or a decoder that was intentionally set at a lower bitrate, when compared to the Playstation 3 decoder.  Now, there are some color aberrations and there is no control to reduce the apparent high temperature of the color palette.  When looking closer at the TV screen (I have a good one, a XBR-65X950B), one can conclude that this decoder does not feature a well implemented deblocking filter.  I am sad and disappointed.  And, if am a little technical here, is because I tried my best to make a fair set of assumptions before publishing a negative review for an otherwise nice player.  But the H.264 decoder needs to be improved or serious videophiles like me will not go for this product.\n\nIn a nutshell:  4K Ultra High Definition is very well implemented.  Conventional Blu-Ray playing is mediocre and does not upscale but actually downscales normal Blu-Ray content.  If you intend to play ONLY 4K content, go for it. If you intend to play BOTH 4K AND 1080p Blu-Ray content, wait a bit more for future upgrades or new players or plan to pay $500 with a more expensive player.\n\n****UPDATE IN JULY 30***\n\nApparently Sony has updated the AVC decoding algorithm with the newest firmware upgrade and now the deblocking filter has been implemented and other improvements are evident on the AVC (Advanced Video Coding) decoder which is the one that upscales Blu-Ray content to 4K.  Highly recommended!\n\nPerhaps if the storage would not be necessary via an external USB drive it would be cleaner for the purpose of having BD-Live content viewing and storage.  In any case, this units seems to be solid and now performs as expected.",

         "I upgraded to this from a Netgear G router I bought a decade ago because I switched from Spectrum internet to fiber. I chose this model for a balance between price and dual band network capability.\n\nSetup was a snap and took a total of 5 minutes! It connects directly to the wall because I don’t have a modem with fiber.\nWent to the website and followed the installation wizard. I have not looked for open source firmware, so I’m only commenting on the router with TP-link installed firmware.\n\nA couple of things to noteas far as performance: my old spectrum/ G router combo only gave me wireless speeds of 12 mbps, so I’m not hard to please when it comes to super fast connections.\n\nI have 7 devices in my household- laptop, tablet, Roku, 2 phones, a Wii and Xbox.\nThe fiber connection is *advertised* to support up to 250 mbps.\n\nI did not test my wired speed because I don’t use my devices that way.\n\nI ran the speed test on my IPhone on the 5G network (which also has the Xbox and tablet connected)  and am showing around 36 mbps. Good enough for me. The picture shows: TOP TP-link router/ fiber internet MIDDLE Netgear G router/fiber and BOTTOM Netgear G router/Spectrum Internet. You can really see how much better this is over a G router.\n\nOn the 2.4 network, my laptop(which has a b, g, n adapter and won’t connect to ac) speed test clocked around 26. The Roku is also connected to this network, and streams fine (but it also streamed fine on the old one too)\n\nThe signal on both bands is very strong upstairs, downstairs and on my back porch.\n\nOverall, this is a great router if you want a low cost option to get in on the 5G WiFi network.\n\n It’s not lightening fast, but it’s better than the old G Router and 5 G speed is better than decent for my needs.\nIt does not perform like higher class and higher priced routers but then again, it’s way, way better than what I expected for $40.",

         "I've tested a great many bluetooth speakers and only a few bubble up as clear winners: in the mid-size portable range, Klipsch KMC3 and Bang & Olufsen Beolit 15 / 17 are the distinct winners for big sound from a small machine. In the ultra-portable range, Bose SoundLink Mini has simply dominated every other compact offering, bar none, for four years. I gave up looking for anything better-sounding in that ultraportable range two years ago - until Bose figured out how to outdo itself. They recently released the Revolve / Revolve+. I bought a Revolve+ the instant I learned about it and found it to be good - but different than the Mini, and not clearly BETTER.\n\nI also recently went back to the well and thought, maybe there's an ultraportable out there that can pack more good sound (ESPECIALLY bass) into a comparably tiny package. I tried the KEF Gravity One... and spit it back out. Fine treble, weird soundstage, twice the price, and absolutely no bass of any kind under 120Hz. Puzzling, but unacceptable. Spit it back out.\n\nI've been eyeballing the B&W T7 as well for some time now and figured, OK, I'll give it a spin. Just bought it and... whiff.\n\nIt doesn't have weak bass, it has no bass. Great crisp treble, good warm vocals, but no bass at all. It's about on par with the KEF Gravity One for having great treble, good mids, and abysmal, entirely absent bass. It looks great, it's well built, it feels and looks like quality, but the sound simply fails. It's so dramatically inferior to the SoundLink Mini and even the Revolve+ that the rest of the features (call handling, battery, etc.) are irrelevant. This is going back. On the basis of sound quality alone, this is &#34;and the rest&#34;. At some point, some engineers and product managers at another company is going to need to force themselves to listen to the tiny Bose speakers - ideally side by side with their own - before they say, yep, good enough, ship it.

I gave up looking for anything better-sounding in that ultraportable range two years ago - until Bose figured out how to outdo itself. They recently released the Revolve / Revolve+. I bought a Revolve+ the instant I learned about it and found it to be good - but different than the Mini, and not clearly BETTER.\n\nI also recently went back to the well and thought, maybe there's an ultraportable out there that can pack more good sound (ESPECIALLY bass) into a comparably tiny package. I tried the KEF Gravity One... and spit it back out. Fine treble, weird soundstage, twice the price, and absolutely no bass of any kind under 120Hz. Puzzling, but unacceptable. Spit it back out.\n\nI've been eyeballing the B&W T7 as well for some time now and figured, OK, I'll give it a spin. Just bought it and... whiff.\n\nIt doesn't have weak bass, it has no bass. Great crisp treble, good warm vocals, but no bass at all. It's about on par with the KEF Gravity One for having great treble, good mids, and abysmal, entirely absent bass. It looks great, it's well built, it feels and looks like quality, but the sound simply fails. It's so dramatically inferior to the SoundLink Mini and even the Revolve+ that the rest of the features (call handling, battery, etc.) are irrelevant. This is going back. On the basis of sound quality alone, this is &#34;and the rest&#34;. At some point, some engineers and product managers at another company is going to need to force themselves to listen to the tiny Bose speakers - ideally side by side with their own - before they say, yep, good enough, ship it. Such as it is, I can tell that no such exercise occurred before shipping this speaker, or any other tiny one for that matter.",

         "Very nice physical build quality, but electronically not very good. I spent ovet an hour cutting wires to length and terminating them with banana plugs.  Then I moved my two heavy large audio cabinets away from the wall and began plugging everything in.  I am using the switch box to switch between a modern surround sound receiver and a vintage 70's intigrated amp that will be used strictly for turntable playback. I am sharing the front speakers between the receiver and amp, since my front channel speakers ate also vintage 70's floorstanding speakers.\n\nWhen i finished plugging everything in, I switched on the surround sound receiver and heard only the subs - no front left and right channel speakers. Playing with the speaker switches on this brand new switchbox, I could intermittently get the speakers to work momentarily if I kept pushing the appropriate speaker switch.\n\nFirst of all I was furious after spending all this time preparing wires and moving furniture. Secondly, I thought to myself, these speaker switches on this box are acting like they have 50 years of oxidation on their contacts.

         "Outstanding quality!  This cable replaced a DVI cable with fully functional HDMI capability.  My video is now crystal clear and the colors vibrant and true with no artifacts.  Although the cable, as pictured, looks as though it might be stiff, it is amazingly supple and compliant.  I'm so impressed with this excellent product that I am ordering another one so that I can have both my desktop and laptop computers attached to my 1080P Panasonic plasma TV.  And when I can afford a 4K OLED TV, they will work with that too.  Did I mention that the audio now comes over the HDMI?\n\nBTW, and although this has nothing to do with this cable, be sure to turn off your TV's OVERSCAN feature.  Do this on ALL inputs and, if it is a 'smart' TV, do it to the phantom input that is assigned to it's W/LAN, as well.  You will be astounded in the improved picture you will get!  Not only can you see the full computer monitor screen on your TV but, you will get much more detailed pictures and video as well.  Search the WWWeb under &#34;how to turn off overscan on my TV&#34; or some such wording, and you will shortly become an expert.  Overscan is a default feature found on virtually all digital TV's, and is a left over, built-in &#34;fix&#34; for analog, CRT TV's.  It CAN be turned off, usually by simply renaming your inputs to DVI/PC, but the actual procedure may vary by manufacturer.  Look it up.\n\nOkay, so why defeat overscan?  Well simply, because it throws away as much as 20% of your pixels and enlarges the remainder to fill your screen.  This means that your nice sharp, big screen TV is showing you a DIGITALLY ZOOMED image.  Not good.  And, if you are using your TV as a PC monitor, all your border detail is missing or only partially there,as well; your tool bars, your edge icons, etc.  Oh yes, and that nice wallpaper that looks so good on your laptop is blurry, washed out, and missing all the good stuff that went into making an appealing, photgraphic composition.\n\n'Nuff said.

         "I bought this laptop about 7 or 8 months ago and it has performed pretty well. Here is what I've out about it since then:\n\nPros:\nScreen - the screen is a good size and bright - I rarely set the brightness above 75%.\n2-in-1 - I don't use it as a tablet nearly as often as I thought I would, but it is nice to have when I need it.\nKeyboard - good size, responsive keys - backlighting is very helpful\nTouchpad - very responsive - great if you typically only use one hand\n\nCons:\nBuild quality - it is quite flimsy. If you pick it up with one hand while it is open you will hear all kinds of pops and creaks. Also, if you typically rest your hands to the sides of the touchpad while you type, it will occasionally register the heal of your hand pressing down as a &#34;click&#34; - even when not touching the touchpad.\nTouchpad - If you normally use two hands to use your touchpad - finger of one hand resting on the left button while the finger(s) of the other hand move the cursor - you'll have problems. The touchpad buttons on this one are also capacitive and you end up zooming in and out repeatedly. So either get use to using one hand or use a mouse.\nTouchscreen - most of the time it works fine, but every couple days it'll just stop working and you'll need to reboot to get it back. Typically it happens when you move it to/from tablet mode.\n\nOverall - for the price this has been a good laptop. It, like most things, has it good points and its bad. I've learned to work around the bad, but would prefer not to. Would I buy it again? Probably not. There are others out there for the same price point that work better. For my job I am assigned HP laptops and of the 3 I've had over the past 6 years, none have had the number of issues this one has had. But then those havent' been 2-in-1 laptops with touchscreens. I didn't mention battery life as either a pro nor a con - it is okay. I typically get about 2 hours depending on what I am doing, screen brightness, and if it involves a lot of wifi.",

Slower than any technology in this century. Whether you're transferring data, or simply browsing data on the drive, this thing is slow. I can walk into my kitchen and get a cup of coffee before it shows the contents of the folder.\n\n3. Thumbnails of images don't appear until days later. Not sure if it's building a preview library or what, but it's annoying.\n\n4. No rescue capability. If you delete a file, it's gone baby. No software you have will rescue it. MAYBE if you spend thousands of dollars and send it to some company, maybe they'll be able to do it. And that's the words from Segate tech support.\n\n5. Transfer speeds crawl after awhile. When transferring data to the drive, it starts out at one speed, but then after awhile, it goes down quite a bit. It's ridiculous that you can't just connect it to a computer to start with to transfer data or move data around on the drive and organize it.\n\n6. Does not do incremental backups. This is so terrible it's unbelievable that they released this on the market. If you have 1 TB of data, and you modify some data files, it will not do an incremental backup to your external USB drive (which they recommend). You'll have to do a full backup every time. 1 TB took me many days to transfer to the USB drive.\n\nI can't tell you how much I dislike this drive. I can't return it or sell it since it has my data on it and I can't do any sort of secure wipe of the drive. I'm stuck with this thing.\n\nMaybe a better option is to buy a external drive and stick on to my router, or even a dedicated computer that's on all the time (so i can do nightly backups, access files 24/7, etc.)\n\nEDIT: April 2017.

I have 3 computers (desktop win 7, laptop win 7, laptop win 10) and all 3 had different problems accessing this drive. I spent at least 4 hours on tech support with different issues.\n\n2. Slower than any technology in this century. Whether you're transferring data, or simply browsing data on the drive, this thing is slow. I can walk into my kitchen and get a cup of coffee before it shows the contents of the folder.\n\n3. Thumbnails of images don't appear until days later. Not sure if it's building a preview library or what, but it's annoying.\n\n4. No rescue capability. If you delete a file, it's gone baby. No software you have will rescue it. MAYBE if you spend thousands of dollars and send it to some company, maybe they'll be able to do it. And that's the words from Segate tech support.\n\n5. Transfer speeds crawl after awhile. When transferring data to the drive, it starts out at one speed, but then after awhile, it goes down quite a bit. It's ridiculous that you can't just connect it to a computer to start with to transfer data or move data around on the drive and organize it.\n\n6. Does not do incremental backups. This is so terrible it's unbelievable that they released this on the market. If you have 1 TB of data, and you modify some data files, it will not do an incremental backup to your external USB drive (which they recommend). You'll have to do a full backup every time. 1 TB took me many days to transfer to the USB drive.\n\nI can't tell you how much I dislike this drive. I can't return it or sell it since it has my data on it and I can't do any sort of secure wipe of the drive. I'm stuck with this thing.\n\nMaybe a better option is to buy a external drive and stick on to my router, or even a dedicated computer that's on all the time (so i can do nightly backups, access files 24/7, etc.)\n\nEDIT: April 2017. I've disconnected drive and no longer use it because of the reasons listed above. Now I have a $180 door stop.",

         "and functional wall mount that is easy to install",
         "4 stars for build quality and ease of use.  3 stars for my application.\nThis is a very simple, affordable, and functional wall mount that is easy to install. The included 4K HDMI cable is a nice bonus. It seems well made and works fine; however, the braided jacket makes it a very stiff cable and it doesn’t route easily. In my opinion, a cable used in a wall mount application should be very flexible and easy to route. The included level is fine; however, I recommend using at least a 2ft level since the included 6” level offers very little confidence for installation. If you plan on mounting this bracket with the outlet(s) situated between the upper and lower rails like I did, be aware that the opening is the EXACT height of a typical outlet cover. If you have more than one outlet, make sure they are at the exact same height or you will need to trim the covers to attach the mount to the wall. And low profile surge suppressors may or may not interfere with the bracket. The spacing between railings is the biggest negative I have against this mount. The top & bottom bracket rails are in two pieces for TV’s over 32”, or for TV mounting holes wider than 400mm and unfortunately they aren’t quite long enough to cover 2 studs in all cases. I used a slot to the left of center for a stud and the far right of the bracket was not long enough to reach another stud 16” away. I would have chosen a longer wall mount if I had known the bracket dimensions up front. But thankfully LCD TV’s are pretty light so I’m not too concerned about having to use the drywall option for the right side. At east I have one solid stud connection and it’s close to the center of the TV. There’s a decent assortment of bolts and washers, but even one more spacer option, maybe 1”, would be welcome. The blue plastic pull tabs to release the bracket from the lower rail hang down below the level of my 55” TV and the supplied adhesive magnet strips to attach to the plastic pull tabs don’t stick well, so plan on tucking the pull tabs into the bracket, or wiring, so they are not visible. Overall, this is a very inexpensive mount and will likely work fine in most cases, but based on my experience I can’t rate it much above average.",

         "Outstanding performance and price. I rate it a 9 out of 10. Just received this well engineered and constructed hybrid camera. The OSD button is used to chose between Analog HD, TVI, CVI, or analog modes. I use the camera with a Annke DT81Y DVR in TVI mode, purchased through Amazon. The camera delivers excellent color in high definition during the day. For the night, the camera has 4 high powered infrared leds mounted behind a black masking filter and low light technology. The 4 leds are not hidden and are visible as small red dots. I have an Annke camera, purchased through Amazon, which completely hides its powerful leds. The camera comes in a well designed, robust, weatherproof metal case, sunshade, and mounting bracket. The cable is threaded through the mounting bracket to protect it from harsh sun and weather. The camera would get a 10 except for some minor issues. My camera is used to watch a parking lot. The parking lot receives light from three very tall street HID lights illuminating a major commercial 4 lane street, and one parking lot HID lamp. At night the camera delivers a crisp image in very light color that is almost all black and white. The more artificial light from the HID sources the more color. The camera comes with a hex wrench to adjust the variable 2.8mm to 12mm lens. There are two hex nuts under the barrel of the camera. The first nut moves the lense back to increase the magnification. The second nut focuses the image. It was touch and go to get the wrench to fit into the hex holes in the nuts. Once the wrench was finally pushed into place with each nut, turning the nuts was not a smooth and light operation. Force was needed to turn the nuts. There was snapping and popping. Did I break the lens? After moving the lens to the 12mm position, there was no response in trying to focus. I do not give up. My philosophy with any type of mechanical or electronic thing is improvise, and &quot;fix it or break it.&quot; After spending an excessive amount of time messing with the adjusting screws  I wound up with a 12mm, close up, focused image. The last small issue is that the bracket design is mainly for mounting on a vertical surface. It can be adjusted to mount on a horizontal surface, but the mount will not allow the bracket to be adjusted to look down more than 45 degrees from the arm.",

         "A very good camera on the price-performance scale",
         "Ok, I have to admit I’m getting to be a fan of SV3C.  This is the third camera I have purchased from them for various rental properties, and this PTZ security camera is spot-on when it comes to performance vs. cost.\n\nRight out of the box the installation process was a breeze. The camera comes with everything you need to get it set up, including mounting hardware and power cable/adaptor – you just supply the ladder.  I had it connected to my WiFi network in minutes, so it went from box to live feed on my phone in less than an hour.\n\nThe PTZ (pan, tilt, zoom) functionality on this camera is top notch. It lets me easily control the camera from my phone and move it around to get a better view of the area being monitored.  This camera is being used in the back of a rental property looking out for wildlife, specifically coyotes, and kids using ATV’s and motorcycles in my fields. With the PTZ feature, I can easily move the camera around to get a better view of the surrounding area, and with the cloud feature and motion detection, I can review film over the course of the day to find out in anyone is trespassing on my land.  Best of all, the camera can be set to follow an object as it moves across the field of view, set off an alarm, and/or turn on a light.\n\nThe image quality of the camera is also excellent, especially the smart full-color night vision (when motion is detected). It has 5 megapixel HD resolution, which means the video footage is crystal clear even when digitally zoomed in. The camera rotates 355 degrees, which allows it to capture an entire six acres from one vantage point on my barn. In terms of durability, the camera seems to be very well-made. It already had its first battle against the weather – almost 3” of rain – and came out without fogging up or other issues.  This is critical for Massachusetts as we can get some rather extreme weather at times.\n\nOverall, I’m extremely happy with this latest PTZ security camera from SV3C.

         "I was not sure about this thing when we ordered it. In the box are the display with a long cord with plug ends on it, a tool to open a panel in the car, and some instructions.  It was nice that it came with the tool. Installing this thing was really easy. I even was able to install it while the car was still in the garage…not a lot of space to open the doors all the way. I needed a flashlight, and that was it. You open the panel on the back of the center console from the back seat. There is only one cable there with a connector.  You undo this connector and then connect the cable with the new display to it. The connectors only fit in one way, so you can’t mess this up. Then you just run the cable along the driver side to the front. You wedge it into the air vent centered behind the steering wheel. I was a little skeptical about this and thought it would come out, but it is a good fit. Nothing gets damaged…no screws or glue or double sided tape which is nice. Remember the cord comes out the RIGHT side of the display and goes behind it to the left. If you do not do this it will be upside down. After this is in and centered, tuck the cord in. I tucked it in around the side plastic trim and then under the floor mats in the back. You only see the cord in two spots. You see it right where it comes out of the air vent and goes over to the side panel for about 2 inches and then you see 1 inch of it right where it goes from the back of the driver’s seat to the center console near the base. Not too bad. I like how I did not have to take 1/2 the car apart to hide this cord. I also like that the display changes light intensity to match the light intensity of the normal display screen. This is nice for night and day driving, so you can see it but it is not blinding. It has turn signals, speed, seatbelt warning, and gear. When the car is stopped it will tell you battery percent. I am glad I got this thing.  I will say, the instructions it comes with are not really good. The pictures are so small you have no idea what you are looking at. Seriously, just look at the video on Amazon.  It is way more instructive than the instructions that are included. Aside from crummy instructions, this thing",

         "Quality Optical Components, Bright & Clear Images,",
         "If you've been looking for a quality monocular, this model is a great choice for the price.  It's rated at 10 x 42.  Objects viewed will appear 10 times closer.  The 42 refers to the size in millimeters of the large glass lens at the end of the scope.  The larger the outer lens is, the more light that can enter resulting in a brighter object being viewed.  I was impressed with this monocular's internal construction using high quality glass BAK4 prisms and FMC coatings.  These two features are typically found on higher-end optical devices and the end result is clearer and brighter images.\n\nBut as this monocular is designed for outdoor use, the chamber is encased in a thick, rubberized coating which is rated at IPX7 waterproof.  An IPX7 rating means the device can physically survive a dunk in water 2-3' deep but not if immersed in flowing water or driving wind and rain conditions when force is involved.\n\nI like many design features such as the small supplied insert that screws into the 1/4-20 tripod socket beneath the scope.  A supplied wrist lanyard can be looped into this insert adding a little extra safety when handling the device.  A small tripod is also included and is good for desktop use especially when viewing objects near eye level.  If you're looking at birds overhead or stars at night, I recommend using a monopod or tripod to help steady the view.  Ten power is about the maximum you can hand-hold and external stabilization is always a big help.  The scope also comes with a phone holder allowing you to take photographs through the lens.  I've included a photo but due to cloudy skies at night, I haven't been able to take a picture of the moon yet. Comes with handy small tripod, carrying pouch, wrist lanyard, durable lens covers.  Easy to focus with large knurled knob.\n\nBottom Line: Monoculars by design are a cross between a spotting scope, binocular and telescope.  This one juggles the constraints of each one and in the end, is versatile, durable and optically accurate.  I think it works best in combination with a monopod for birding and general observation.  For star gazing or when using it as a spotting scope, you'll want a tripod.  Rugged design and waterproof makes it good for camping or the beach.",

         "Wonderful Indoor Security Camera!",
         "Hey everyone! It's your favorite Amazon reviewer, Sean 'The Tester' Chao, back again with a new product! Today we're looking at blurams' Security Camera 2K.\n\n- Build: This product is very well-made.  The material used is hard, durable plastic.  The moving components, to include the swivel, does so seamlessly.  Our inspection did not identify any manufacturer defect with our test product, nor did we find any notable design flaw.  We assess that this product will last 3+ years if treated with proper care.\n- Price: At the time of writing, this product is priced comparably to similar products on the market. The indoor security camera  niche is highly saturated, and we observed comparable products coming in at both lower and higher price points.  However, this product differentiates itself with an exceptional in-house app support, high resolution imagery, multiple practical features (e.g. two-way chatting, siren, motion detection), and 360 degree swivel. Additionally, blurams is an established brand, thereby commanding it a premium price when compared to many of its competitors.  For this reason, we consider this product to be a great value.\n- Function: This product works as intended. We were able to use the blurams app to control the camera without any issue.  We do note that the initial pairing process does take a few attempts, particularly with the camera reading the QR code to sync into the account.  Beyond that initial sync process, though, we were very satisfied with the control and cloud recording for this device.  We'd like to note that the app alone makes this a worthwhile investment, as it is a very polished product, and becomes even more so as you add more blurams products to your home.\n- Aesthetics: This product is compact and is unassuming when placed in the background.\n\nBottom line: This is a great security camera.  It is compact, packed with features, and is priced competitively.  We therefore recommend this to anyone looking for this type of product.\n\nThis product earns the 'Sean's Supreme Seal.'\n\n**Seals are rated on this scale**\nPoor: No Seal\nAverage: 'Sean's Satisfactory Seal'\nGood: \"Sean's Superior Seal'\nExcellent: \"Sean's Supreme Seal'",

The drive features a durable and rugged ABS and metal housing body with a ring design, and the inside uses an imported smart chip to ensure excellent resistance against water, magnets, high temperatures, and X-rays. The compact size of the drive, at 1.9 x 0.5 x 0.4 inches, makes it easy to carry, and it comes with a loop that can be attached to a keychain or lanyard to prevent loss.

         "I’ve looked at enough earbuds these days to have developed what is for me a good set of criteria to judge them and only one of those criteria is how they sound.\n\n1) How they sound – of course this is important!\nThese earbuds sound pretty good! Mostly that’s because they have sufficient bass something that is not common with earbuds that do not also have an equalizer app. These are by no means super-audiophile level earbuds but they do not disappoint like so many inexpensive earbuds do. These get a thumbs up on sound.\n\n2) Playing time\nThese earbuds are rated to last 5 hours before needing to go back into the case and they do last that long. That’s a little too short for me because I use them to help me sleep using Apple iPhone Background sounds (which is fantastic!) and I will literally wake up to the sound of the earbuds telling me to charge them. But it’s not terrible – I just pop in the other earbud and it’s back to zzzzz-ing.\n\n3) The case\nThe case with these earbuds opens easily and with sufficient clearance to make getting the earbuds out of the case easy. This is important because I have earbuds where the top of the case does not get far enough out of the way so you can get the darn things out! These earbuds also rest high enough out of their charging position so that there is plenty to grab to get them out. USB-C connection to charge it – check! I like the case.\n\n4) Fit\nFor me the earbuds mostly fit well but one slipped out a couple of times even after trying different ear tips. A little annoying but everyone is different and considering how many really good (and expensive) earbuds turn up in Lost-And-Found’s this is not an issue specific to this product.\n\n5) Overall\nFor me 5 stars means it’s a great product and only the somewhat limited play time bumps this down a notch. This will probably not make a difference for most people who listen on and off during the day and can pop the ‘buds back in the case for a top-off. I can easily recommend these.",

         "I'll start by saying that in terms of being fast, it's fast. If you come from a mechanic hard drive, it's like going from a horse carriage to a Lamborghini. Even from a SATA SSD, you'll feel some gains. If you currently have an M.2 ssd, unless you're doing very specific transfer tasks, you're not going to 'feel' a difference. Windows boot will be similar, and game loading will still be limited to the game developers optimization for pc. I upgraded from a 980 Pro, and knew I wouldn't see a difference, but I need it another SSD anyways. The reason this gets four stars is because of the fact that these should all be coming with heatsinks nowadays. The fact that I couldn't even purchase the heat sink version because of the sold out is so annoying. I would have had no problem paying an extra 10 or $20 for a heat sink but Samsung should have just made them all with heatsinks by default and show that they are truly a premium brand when it comes to solid state drives. So as you'd expect, it gets toasty and I see no difference in heat compared to the 980 pro, so Samsung gimmicky cooling solution nonsense on their website is just that, nonsense. The heatsink is what will make a difference, not their 'utting-edge thermal control algorithm technology'. As far as advertised speeds go, I typically get anywhere from 6500 to 6800 read and 5500 to 6500 write. That's typical as it's very rare that you'll get your SSD to push its top limits, and you're never going to feel a speed difference that small. Random read and random write speeds for benchmarking are all over the place, and these are the important speeds, but they fluctuates depending on heat and 8 million other factors going from bios settings to whatever windows is doing at any given time. All in all, it is the fastest SSD on the market and you can't go wrong, but if you're looking for a speed boost you're not going to see one coming from an M.2 drive. I would however consider upgrading from a pci 3.0 drive if you've made the switch to a pci 4.0 motherboard.  If you're able to get the heat sink version definitely 100% get it. Because of this card it's ridiculously hot. Not hot to wear it will get damaged, but hot enough to slow down speeds. Then again, it's still fast and it's Inferno conditions.",

Even from a SATA SSD, you'll feel some gains. If you currently have an M.2 ssd, unless you're doing very specific transfer tasks, you're not going to 'feel' a difference. Windows boot will be similar, and game loading will still be limited to the game developers optimization for pc. I upgraded from a 980 Pro, and knew I wouldn't see a difference, but I need it another SSD anyways. The reason this gets four stars is because of the fact that these should all be coming with heatsinks nowadays. The fact that I couldn't even purchase the heat sink version because of the sold out is so annoying. I would have had no problem paying an extra 10 or $20 for a heat sink but Samsung should have just made them all with heatsinks by default and show that they are truly a premium brand when it comes to solid state drives. So as you'd expect, it gets toasty and I see no difference in heat compared to the 980 pro, so Samsung gimmicky cooling solution nonsense on their website is just that, nonsense. The heatsink is what will make a difference, not their 'utting-edge thermal control algorithm technology'. As far as advertised speeds go, I typically get anywhere from 6500 to 6800 read and 5500 to 6500 write. That's typical as it's very rare that you'll get your SSD to push its top limits, and you're never going to feel a speed difference that small. Random read and random write speeds for benchmarking are all over the place, and these are the important speeds, but they fluctuates depending on heat and 8 million other factors going from bios settings to whatever windows is doing at any given time. All in all, it is the fastest SSD on the market and you can't go wrong, but if you're looking for a speed boost you're not going to see one coming from an M.2 drive. I would however consider upgrading from a pci 3.0 drive if you've made the switch to a pci 4.0 motherboard.  If you're able to get the heat sink version definitely 100% get it. Because of this card it's ridiculously hot. Not hot to wear it will get damaged, but hot enough to slow down speeds. Then again, it's still fast and it's Inferno conditions.",

         "I recently used this kit on two different builds, one that was 6 years old and a new one.  It did a great job.\n\nOld Build:\nThe cleaner turned a dark blue/green color and was non-transparent after the 8 hours it ran through the loop.  Once it was rinsed and the Superflush run through for 24 hours, the PETG tubing and acrylic reservoir shined like new.  Both had become a little cloudy over the years but now they're clear.\n\nNew Build:\nFollowing the same process produced the same results.  The cleaner again, turned blue/green but this time was still transparent.  The GPU water-block top is clear acrylic, and even though it's a new block, I can see that the nickel channels are noticeably brighter.  All of the acrylic tubing and nickel parts gleam now.\n\nThe instructions aren't on the bottles, so you'll want to download the manuals from EK.  In them it calls for a 15-minute rinse of the cleaner using the Superflush but to continue rinsing until all of the foam is gone then refill with Superflush and run for 24 hours.  That said, the cleaner foams a lot once you start flushing, so in my case it took several refill/rinse cycles and there wasn't enough Superflush mixture to use it for all of the rinse cycles.  So, I rinsed each loop for 15 minutes x2 with Superflush and for the remainder of the rinse cycles I used distilled water.  Once the foam was completely gone, I refilled with Superflush and let them run for 24 hours.\n\nOne thing that happed in the new loop that didn't with the old one, flux washed out of one of the radiators and the sticky residue collected on the GPU water-block.  OCD got the best of me and I didn't trust that the Superflush would remove it, so once the rinse cycles were complete, I opened the GPU block and cleaned off the flux, but now I think the Superflush would have removed it.  The instructions state you might manually flush the radiators with the cleaner before they're installed but mine were already installed so it wasn't an option.\n\nAfter the cleaning, I refilled both loops with Cryofuel Clear and am very happy with the results.

         "Forces you to use their mobile app (ew, give me a web interface so I can use any device) and create a cloud account. Not happy at all about that. It does give an amazing quality image for the price though.\n\nPros:\n- Has a great image quality during day and nighttime (didn't except such a good quality night time image for this price)\n- Can add an SD card to store recordings on-device\n- Small form-factor\n\nCons:\n- RTSP support was dropped and you have to use some old beta firmware that they no longer have on their website. As someone who hates cloud (if I was going to break into your house I will just jam your wifi and bam, you have no security video of the event) this was a huge bummer. The beta RTSP firmware does work but this should be an officially supported thing and it's really not hard to add. They just want to milk you for that cloud subscription.\n- No ability to set static IP address. Huge bummer for a security camera.\n- You can only configure this via their cloud app that requires internet and tracks everything you do.\n- Forces you to install the mobile app to configure the device. As someone who is security conscious I absolutely hate mobile apps. Just give me a web interface I can access over my LAN.\n- If the company cloud system goes down your camera is a fancy paper weight\n\nThis device basically takes the shaver and blades model by selling the device at a loss (or barely any profit) and make it up in cloud subscription sales. I would totally pay an extra bit of money to get a device that doesn't require their cloud at all and lets you access the streams over the LAN from the camera.\n\nI enabled RTSP and blocked all internet access to the device from my router. This makes it as secure as it can get for now. I just hate that I can't configure the device now because the app has to use the internet to communicate with the camera. I will not be buying more of these products unless they change things.\n\nI would never use one of these for an actual security camera due to the above limitations. I am just using it to monitor my bearded dragon cage so it is fine. I will never buy one of these products again unless they change.",

         "This is a very nice fitness tracker for anyone in any age range looking to try their first watch/fitness tracker.  I wanted one because my doctor told me I need to increase my daily activity.  I got it mainly to track my daily steps, total walking distance, calories burned, and heart rate.  Which this does very well.  It also tracks other indicators as well.  You can link it to your phone and accept/reject calls, etc.  But, I mainly wanted to know how my activity levels are over time.  It seems to be accurate, but I couldn't really check scientifically.\n\nThis tracker only takes a few minutes to setup and create an account for the App on your phone.  It has a lot of permissions and allows you to connect to many different social media accounts, which I didn't do.  It has a nice magnetic charge that you plug into any USB port and attach to the watch.  It also comes with a plastic screen protector you can attach.  There are a lot of different options you can set for the watch through the App, as well as a number of different watch faces to choose from.\n\nThe watch and band are comfortable, but it can get a little warm after awhile, because it is just plastic.  But after using it for a week I hardly knew it is there anymore.  It has all of the functions available easily from the watch face.  This includes your email, phone, text, weather, etc.  Initially, I choose to setup the minimum options and not use it to make phone calls, etc.  I just wanted to see how well the health/fitness tracker information was at first.  But, after a couple weeks I added the ability to call/receive phone calls and text messages.  These are \"nice to have\" things and they worked well.  Making a call was easy and talking via the watches microphone worked surprisingly well.  (It made me think I was Maxwell Smart from the old TV show \"Get Smart.\")\n\nOverall, I think it is a very good fitness tracker for the price.  The watch and App work well.  I didn't see any power drain on my phone's battery from the App or being linked to my phone all the time.  I would certainly recommend this watch/fitness tracker to anyone.  I think it would be great for a Middle School or High School student too.",

         "This monitor is great. It's thin, light weight, the aluminum housing feels plenty strong and lends a reassuring rigidity to the monitor, the speakers are surprisingly not bad, and it comes with all the cables you need.\nThe picture quality is quite good - 1080p at 15.6\" is pretty ideal in my book. You don't have any weird scaling to deal with but you also don't have to squint to see anything. The colors are solid and look good. I wouldn't trust it for color accurate work but for watching a video it was quite good. The speakers were way better than I expected - I was playing sound from my 2017 workstation class laptop and the speakers sounded pretty comparable in quality. Not good enough for audio mixing but impressively decent for how thin the display is and for the fact that the speakers face away from you. The full size HDMI port means you'll never have to rely on a single cable and can instead use any regular HDMI cable which is a huge win and the two USB C ports, are both full function despite one being labelled for power only.\n\nWhere I'm slightly disappointed is that for most devices I think you'll have to bring along more than just one USB C cable. I was able to power on the display but not have anything show up using both my phone and my Switch. Looking through the instructions they do recommend using both a power and data cable for nearly every use case. I did get it to power on and display an image with use a single USB C type cable plugged into a Thunderbolt 3 port but I would recommend always bringing the power brick with you just in case.\nThe downside of that is that the fabric sleeve doesn't have a pocket for the large power brick. Despite only needing a 5V 3A brick the included power brick is larger than some of my 40W USB PD charging bricks. And without a nice spot to store that massive brick in the sleeve, I find myself either tossing it in with the screen (far from ideal) or using another pocket in my backpack to bring the brick along. Certainly not a deal breaker and somewhere expected for a display without a battery but still disappointing.\n\nOverall this is a solid screen and I really do like it.

Problem here was that I needed to look at the small image of the watch in the guide to determine the side band that needed removal. There is no text identification for which band needs removal. The band was so tightly attached to the watch that I could not pull it off by hand. Just would not budge and thought I was breaking the watch.

Get one, or several. You won’t regret it. What I don’t like is the Alexa app. I’ve been programming computers since 1969, and have used every human interface imaginable, including punching in hex codes from the front panel while the machine was running. The Alexa app is, by far, the worst I have ever used. Yes, it’s even worse than punching in hex codes. It obviously was never designed. People just added stuff whenever they felt like it, without regard to anything that anyone else had done. For example, when you make a change, sometimes you have to save the change, sometimes it just happens immediately. You never know which is which. When you need to save, you never know where to look for the save button. Sometimes it’s at the top, sometimes it’s at the bottom, sometimes it’s big, sometimes it’s tiny and barely noticeable.  You will notice that you can display “all devices” from several locations, but the displays are all different, and there are things you can do from one display that you can’t from another. Good luck on remembering where you found the one you actually needed. And then there’s the “help” feature. Once you manage to find it, you’ll find lots of “make sure your device is plugged in” instructions and other brainless nonsense. There are occasional references to menu selections that don’t exist. Once you follow the instructions, you will find that nothing happens. This is not always the case, but it happens more often than not. This is because two or more features are working at cross purposes to one another. Apparently they were developed by two different groups that never talked to each other. The Alexa app needs to be redesigned from the ground up. The documentation needs to be thoroughly scrubbed. Sets of instructions need to be tested to make sure they actually work. Instructions need to be created for things that people actually want to do. No, I don’t want to order 25 tons of paper clips, and I don’t want you to tell me how to do it.

         "I love this product. I bought one echo dot 3, and immediately fell in love. I now own several of version 3 and several of version 5, along with a couple echo sow 5s. I love them all. Get one, or several. You won’t regret it. What I don’t like is the Alexa app. I’ve been programming computers since 1969, and have used every human interface imaginable, including punching in hex codes from the front panel while the machine was running. The Alexa app is, by far, the worst I have ever used. Yes, it’s even worse than punching in hex codes. It obviously was never designed. People just added stuff whenever they felt like it, without regard to anything that anyone else had done. For example, when you make a change, sometimes you have to save the change, sometimes it just happens immediately. You never know which is which. When you need to save, you never know where to look for the save button. Sometimes it’s at the top, sometimes it’s at the bottom, sometimes it’s big, sometimes it’s tiny and barely noticeable.  You will notice that you can display “all devices” from several locations, but the displays are all different, and there are things you can do from one display that you can’t from another. Good luck on remembering where you found the one you actually needed. And then there’s the “help” feature. Once you manage to find it, you’ll find lots of “make sure your device is plugged in” instructions and other brainless nonsense. There are occasional references to menu selections that don’t exist. Once you follow the instructions, you will find that nothing happens. This is not always the case, but it happens more often than not. This is because two or more features are working at cross purposes to one another. Apparently they were developed by two different groups that never talked to each other. The Alexa app needs to be redesigned from the ground up. The documentation needs to be thoroughly scrubbed. Sets of instructions need to be tested to make sure they actually work. Instructions need to be created for things that people actually want to do. No, I don’t want to order 25 tons of paper clips, and I don’t want you to tell me how to do it. (I’m kidding, but not by much.)",

However it didn’t start out that way because they are different enough from regular headphones that I needed to adapt to their differences.\nA. When I first received these I was disconcerted by the fact that they do not hold snug to the back of my head or neck which is what I was used to with regular types. They kind of flopped about and I was annoyed that I couldn’t wear my ponytail in certain ways without it interfering with the headphones. It really irritated me. With use however I got used to the fact that these need more room for movement in order to stay in the right position for bone conduction. Now I don’t even notice it.\nB. I am starting to have low vision issues due to an eye condition. This made it hard for me to figure out what slots, tabs and buttons were for which function. As you can see in one of my photos, I accidentally ripped a button off the side while trying to figure out where the charging port was. I don’t know what that button was for, but the headphones work fine for me without it.\nC. I had no idea what to expect from bone conduction sound. The sound quality was good enough that I didn’t know until reading about bone conduction headphones later that it can be an issue. I was miffed at first that others can hear what I am listening too. I thought these would make the sound private like with other headphones. I was also upset that I couldn’t hear people clearly in my environment like other reviews claim. I still need to pause my audio or take off the headphones if someone needs to speak to me. The sound needs to be really low for me to be able to have music going AND be able to hear others. This still confuses me, but it’s still slightly better than regular headphones. The other factor that may be playing a large part in my struggle here is that I have ADHD so it is ALWAYS hard for me to focus on two sound events at once. So it is likely not an issue with these headphones, but just an issue with my own brain. I just cannot have music going on in my ear if I am going to try to converse with and understand someone talking to me.

         "Im writing this review because I purchased this laptop on 03/22/2022. Today is March 1, 2023. I am two weeks away from having owned this pc for a year. The pros- super fast everything- awesome graphics- doesnt hurt the pocket as much as other gaming laptops. The cons? Battery life SUCKS- it is basically on an IV- you can adjust the settings but even on the optimal or silent condiotions, this CPU and GPU are so powerful they drain the battery in 2 hours or less- even when your not doing anything serios. Just using excel or word- battery drain. The only other con that i have that I ant pepl to be aware of- about 2 weeks ago I started having fan noise- bearings failing. I am now trying to find OEM replacements. This things spins fans at over 6000RPMs. . . yes, that is correct- 6000RPMs. I can not find fans that are rated for that high of RPMs and I need them before my PC melts down- I have always used a cooling pad as support and kept the guts clean and treated this ting like a newborn baby in terms of gentleness. It is just a parts issue- not a user/operator error. I am a MEchatronics Engineering Student and a programmer as well as a controls system specialost so my computer is my every day tool and with that said- my purposes demand quality and power as much as reliability and I take very good care of my equipment. This PC has not let me down- besides the fact that the fan bearings are barking now. I also want to mention that this little PC will support up to 4 extended displays wit hno issues, run multiple intense programs and take it  all with a beating- has never went over 70 degrees celcius and i rin this littlpe puppy overclocked to the max- hence the fan issue- however that is what this PC is meant/designed/built for. If anyone knows were i can find cooling fans PLEASE let me know. I really want to replace them with high performance fans and not just run of  the mill aftermarket general condition types fans. Thanks!!!!!! I deinately wisay that I do not think you will be dissapointed in your purchasse of this PC. Ii have only \"gamed\" on it once or twice- EVE Online and it performed flawlessly. Unbelievable graphics- a 12 hour binge with not a single issue.",

         "I've owned between three to four pairs of the Jabra Elite Active 65t over the last several years. They're great earbuds for working out, but with two usability complaints:\n\n1. After sweating a lot when working out the earbuds may fall off when your head is facing downwards (such as when doing a plank or pushups). Not a big deal in my case, as you can start feeling the earbuds loosening, so you can push them back in.\n\n2. Sometime when pulling the earbud out, the earpad would often get stuck in my ear. One time it was rather scary, as I couldn't get it out and a doctor needed a tool to remove it (He did gift me the tool in case it happened again, and probably a laugh he saved until I was out the door).\n\nEither way, if you're reading this, it's likely because the earbuds are more affordably priced as Jabra has made newer models since.\n\nDo NOT buy them.\n\nI bought a new pair as my original Active 65t could only remain on for a little over 30min after having owned them from 3-to-4 years, with its capacity to hold a charge slowly dwindling over time.\n\nI should have kept them.\n\nThis new pair of earbuds would never turn on. Their LEDs would not show low battery, despite charging the case overnight. I got a replacement for another new-in-box pair, and the same issue occurred. Went through the same steps on Jabra's website to attempt to fix the issue, repeated them when dealing with customer service, at which point they told me to try to get an exchange.\n\nMy uneducated guess is that this paid being a model several years old, and already having some battery issues with them in the past, their battery has simply died over time even if never used.\n\nAt this point I just gave up and got the Beats Pro on an online recommendation. Took seconds to pair to my iPhone, and though I've only used them once so far, they work like a charm.\n\nPlease note I also own the Jabra Elite 75t for regular home use, and they work just fine.\n\nJust avoid the Elite Active 65t.",

         "In the world of BT speakers, you want several things.  Portability to take your music or podcasts with you.  Long play time.  You want the music to keep playing for as long as the party lasts.  Quality sound.  You want deep bass sound, nice highs and smooth undistorted vocals.  And among the most important, affordability.\n\nWell, congratulations, you've found the SBOSENT Bluetooth Portable Speaker and your bases are covered for not a lot of money.\n\nThis speaker is rugged.  You can take it with you camping or hiking or to the beach or virtually anywhere.  It's built tough with a hard, rubberized coating that will protect your investment for a long time.  The speaker is water resistant and the seal that protects the speakers connections is tight and will resist everything except being submerged for an extended period of time.  Rain and splashes will bounce right off.\n\nIn addition to the BT feature, the SBOSENT Bluetooth Portable Speaker can play music from an SD card, or  by way of AUX in cord (for devices that don't use BT technology) and it also has the ability to play FM radio, though I find that connecting the supplied AUX cord will serve as an antenna and allow for more stations and clearer reception.\n\nThe speaker also has up to 8 hours of play time.  Obviously using the speakers lights or raising the volume will shorten play time, but if you are looking to extend play time, turning off the lights or lowering the volume will help.\n\nNice, full sound.  The bass is deep, the mids are clear and you can hear the high(er) end of the music spectrum as cymbals ring out.  Nice sound.  You're not going to rock a stadium, but this speaker plays clearly even at louder volumes.\n\nAt just $26 per speaker (you can get two of these, connect them to each other, then to your BT device, for a truer stereo sound), this speaker is a great deal.  It's rugged, it plays music or podcasts in a variety of ways, it's portable enough to go wherever you go and you can connect to FM radio for weather updates or emergency situation information.  And up to 8 hours of play time.\n\nAll in all, this is a great value and will provide years of service.",

         "A very flexibly device that works surprisingly well.\n\nBiggest surprise is that you can only share audio if both people have 3.5mm devices - only the 3.5mm ports or the USB C audio port can be used at one time. So if one person has a 3.5mm headphone and the other has a USB C audio headphone, you can't share the audio.\n\nPros:\n+ Tested both 3.5mm ports with multiple headphones (Apple OEM, Sennheiser, Bose with Apple in-line controls, cheap no-name). All work perfectly with equal volume from both.\n+ Tested the USB C audio port with both a native USB C headphone and regular headphones with a USB C to 3.5mm  adapter.  Worked with both.  In-line controls even worked for both the native USB C headphone and those used via Adapter.\n+ Both 3.5mm audio ports can be used at the same time\n+ Apple OEM devices in-line controls work - volume, start/stop\n+ Can provide power to PD-enabled device and use audio ports (see limitation below)\n+ Power port supports full PD power throughput (tested to 30w)\n\nCons:\n- Does not charge non-PD devices, regardless of power type (PD, non-PD) provided\n- Cannot use both the USB C audio with any of the 3.5mm audio ports at the same time\n- Bose Apple in-line controls do not work, but the music does play\n- With USB C audio port - you have to connect the adapter first, then USB C audio device to the adapter for the USB C audio to engage.  Otherwise seems they don't work.\n- My copy seems to have a minor grounding problem - there is a faint background hum on the 3.5mm ports.  Detectable when used with noise-cancelling headphones.  Same headphones do not have the problem on other adapters.\n\nIf you have an iPad, this is a good device.  The audio works well with my low-end Android 12 tablet, but it's a non-PD power device so I can't power it from this.\n\nIf you device supports PD power, this is a very versatile device that works well.",

I had some memory sticks so I bumped it up to 16gb DDR4 dual channel.  You have no overclocking in the BIOS so limited to 2100 mhz on the mem.(HP business computer after all).  There is a NVME connector so out went the mech. HD and in with 1TB NVME.  There is a connector for a WiFi card on the MB but I had USB dongles for WiFI and Bluetooth laying around.  I added a low profile video card to the PCI-E 16 port.  Hard to remove the cover from the port to the outside but with a bit of work it was almost impossible to remove.  I ended bending the low quality pot metal case part but finally got the cover off the port and mounted the card.

This would not be a good choice for a novice computer user or gamer.  The list of what you don't get is much bigger than what you do.  Remember...you can't upgrade the OS because it won't run Windows 11 - no TPM 2.0.  Upgrader's dream but poor choice for the end user looking for a complete system.  This is not it.

Price is cheap but you get no more than you pay for.  I would stay away from it unless you know how to make it work.  It will not work out of the box.  Just being real on this.",

Another con was continuity on clarity within the corners of the screen. When setting up these projectors, do your best to project as straight as possible for best overall clarity  using as little keystone necessary and, again, keep in mind this is not a $1,000 projector.

The projector even feels more solid, which I noticed immediately, taking out of the box. The remote is basic, keystone basic, speaker basic, typical fan noise, play around with it for a night and these insignificant perceived flaws will not matter/disappear. Remember the price point and this projector is a no brainer.\nI honestly have no complaints on this projector keeping the price point in mind.

         "Kudos to WAVLINK for taking the weatherproofing claim seriously.  I previously tested an \"outdoor\" wifi extender that claimed to be weatherproof, and literally all they had done was put a plastic shield over the ethernet port.  This device is FAR better designed than that.  There is a single ethernet cable running to the device using power over ethernet, and the cable is tightly sealed by a thick foam rubber gasket and a plastic cover.  Each of the 4 antennas also has a rubber gasket around it to keep water out.  The POE injector is designed to live inside the house, garage, etc, and you use a long ethernet cable to get the wifi extender outdoors.  This is a very well thought out design.  In my case, I temporarily have the extender propped up inside the garage because it's the middle of winter - when spring comes around I will move it outside.\n\nTo configure it as a wifi extender you plug it in, join to it's SSID, and then log in to the admin web page - there is no required mobile app.  The web page requires you to change the admin password and set the country and time zone.  Then it lets you configure the wifi.\n\nI like that when searching for local SSID's to mirror, it clearly calls out which are 5ghz and which are 2.4ghz.  I also like that when mirroring it creates two separate SSID's with the 5ghz and 2.4ghz in the name - so for the devices you are extending to, you can tell them which network to connect to.  There is a power meter (3 LED's) on the device itself so you can tell how much of a network signal it is collecting.  In my case it seems to do quite well - I have it in the garage about 80 feet away from my router and it is showing 3 LED's - full strength.\n\nOverall, I am shocked at how well thought out and easy to use this extender is.  I started working on configuring this about half an hour ago, and I had planned to tinker with it most of the morning.  Instead, here I am half an hour later writing up a positive review - it's all assembled, configured, and parked in the garage.\n\nFantastic job WAVLINK!",

         "[[VIDEOID:4ceed20e94fe3e22dc132253e2edd4b9]] ~ ~ SHORT & SWEET NOTES\n\nMy first impression with this was, \"this feels SOLID.\" And it is. I popped the NVMe tray out to see how much might've been empty space and its sparing: only enough for the tray itself. The rest appears to be forged from a single billet - you can feel it in your hand! It's sturdy and won't be damaged lightly.\n\nI've used other external casings like this one, advertised as having aluminium shells for heat reduction - but none were even close to as thick as this is.\nIt doesn't have anything in the way of gimmicks (USB ports for your USB things, audio jacks, thermal readouts, etc), likely because it's just solid metal.

         "It's enough to say that this fully supports HDMI 2.1 because the standard speaks for itself. Your eyes can see a lot more detail than you realize. The newest tvs support large pixel densities on large screens which makes it easy to pick out single pixels that don't display correctly. At the highest densities each pixel can carry up to 10 or 11 bits of data to support HDR And your refreshing the screen 30 to 60 times per second. A 4k screen is really 3840 pixels across and 2180 pixels vertically.  Thats about 8.3 megapixels.  Or about 99.5 mb/s per refresh.  Or 6 Gb/s at 60 hz.  An 8k screen will be approaching 24 Gb/s.  If you are gaming, devices can try to push the refresh rate higher.\n\nIt's easy to say so what, I am not running these resolutions or refresh rates. But you have to recognize that the only way that you can handle high signals is through special cables. The reason cable companies use that thick coaxial cable is because of a unique property that allows special constructions to act as lossless and low interference conductors. But for most flexible cables we have to use something called twisted pairs. Each of those pairs has to have a very special rate of twisting and separation and a ground plane shield to keep interference at a minimum. Every time you bend a cable especially if it's a sharp bend you cause a signal distortion. That can cause a few bits to arrive a bit later than others. That requires reconstructing the data or resending which slows things down and results in signal loss. Changing the twist rate or crushing the cable also reduces the signal strength. The longer the cable the more critical the design is.\n\nI have a gaming PC that is attached to a high speed monitor and I can run At resolutions greater than 4K and sync speeds approaching 120 hertz. And on a 32 inch monitor you can see if there is any jitter. The bottom line is that good quality cables matter. In this cable is clearly well made. Flexible, on the thick side because it has a very durable outer coating to keep crushing and bending losses to a minimum. The connectors are solid and well made. I know that this cable is going to continue to be useful to me for many years. And to be honest the price is amazing. A few years ago this would have cost 4-6 times more.",

         "I got this headset to replace a headset I use for teleconferencing (using WebEx, or Teams). It comes with a control switch with a permanently attached 3-foot cable and a USB-C connector on the opposite end. It also comes with a USB-A to USB-C adapter, which makes it usable for different configurations right out of the box. The control switch provides functions for Volume, Play/Pause, Answer/Hangup and Mute/Unmute. The headset has a permanently attached 5-foot cable with an audio jack on the opposite end, which plugs into the control switch.\n\nThe headset worked as soon as I plugged it into my laptop USB port. The control switch \"Phone\" button illuminates when the headset is powered. In my setup, the mute button and volume button functions, but pressing the \"Play\" and \"Phone\" buttons has no affect even when on a conference call. These may work with some other applications that I don't use. When not actively connected to a conference call, a female voice announces \"Mute\" through the headset speakers when the mute button is pressed. Likewise, \"Unmute\" is announced when the mute button is pressed again. When the headset is muted, the mute button illuminates red.\n\nI've been using the headset for a few weeks now and every call connection is very clear. Participants inform me that my voice comes across very clear as well. Compared to my old headset, this headset is much more comfortable, and I especially like that the mic boom can be rotated slightly over 180 degrees, making it usable regardless of how you wear it (e.g., you may prefer the cable on your right, rather than on your left). One minor issue for me is the length of the cable from the headset: at 5-feet long, it puts the switch control out of arms reach and you must \"reel it in\" to use it. My solution was to simply coil up the excess cable and secure it with a twist-tie. Not elegant, but effective. If I could change anything about the design, it would be to swap the cord lengths, so the switch control is much closer to the headset.\n\nMy review is strictly based on using this headset for teleconferencing, so I cannot provide an opinion on its use for listening to music, or gaming. For my use, this is a good product: 5-stars.",

         "I'll admit, some of the negative reviews had me doubting this cooler, but I bought one anyways to give it a shot, and I have been very pleasantly surprised.\n\nI build quite a few systems, and so I go through lots of CPU coolers.  Some builds warrant the expensive coolers, but many do not.  I wanted to find a decent quality 'flower' type cooler that could effectively cool a CPU and look good in the process.  I've use many different models of these flower coolers, including the 'UFO' style as well as the very cheap ones with the thin aluminum fins and almost non-existent cowl, so I wanted to see where this one fell.\n\nI'm very happy to say that this one does a fantastic job, seems to have good quality construction, feels like it is made with a decent amount of metal to properly transfer the heat, and looks good in the process.\n\nIn the case of my installation, I mounted it on a Xeon E3-1245 CPU (basically a Xeon equivalent of an i7-2600k), overclocked from 3.3 to 3.7 GHz.  I used a bog-standard gold color thermal paste and mounted it using the provided black plastic ring mount and clips.  This cooler mounts very easily on this ring, just as easily as mounting on a standard AM3 or AM4 cooler mount.  Motherboard is an ASUS P8Z77-LE Plus, for what it's worth.\n\nThe fan is quiet, airflow is very good, and does a good job of cooling the components near the CPU in the process.\n\nWith ambient air temps of around 72F (~22C), idle CPU temps hovered around 29-30C, and once I placed a sustained 100% load on the CPU, stabilized around a max of 68C.  Mind you, this is a 95W CPU, overclocked, and this cooler is a sub-$15 cooler.

         "The Reindoo tablet is a surprisingly decent tablet for the low cost. Its build is not metal but it feels quite well made. The battery lasts a long time, over 5hrs of continuous use per charge. It runs on an Android OS, similar to a mobile interface. It runs a bit slower than higher end tablets and cellphones, but it still works quite well for basic applications such as watching videos and browsing the web. It also seems to only run on 2.4G Wifi networks. I had an issue with it crashing apps and unable to open them again without immediately going back to the home screen, but that problem seemed to disappear after updating and I haven't had that issue since.\n\nOverall, it is just like using an Android phone. Most things seem to default to low quality video that looks pixelated (480P). Since it seems to run more on a mobile interface, it auto selects video resolution based on \"Data rate\" and that always defaults to 480P even on a fast Wifi network. You have to manually change it to 1080P (max) on every video. The result is good though, with good color and resolution. I attached an image of it playing a \"4k\" video on Youtube, but in 1080P. It also has a \"comfort viewing\" setting other than screen brightness where you can adjust the blue light levels of the screen.\n\nThe tablet also comes with a screen protector. The protector is easy to put on if you're familiar with using a card to squeeze out the air bubbles. Be aware that there is a groove for the screen side camera so it must go on in a specific orientation. The protector is also EXACTLY the size of the tablet screen so you must perfectly align the protector to one side within 0.5mm or less, or it will stick out the other end and leave a raised air bubble edge. I accidentally skewed it so one side had a 1 mm gap on one end, so the other side stuck 1mm over the edge, leaving a small air bubble gap at the edge. It doesn't affect the use though. The screen protector is somewhat antireflective has a textured feel like a Kindle reader which I quite like.\n\nOverall, this is a surprisingly great tablet under $100. It is suitable for light work and general browsing. I think this is a great tablet for children instead of more expensive tablets like Ipads and Surfaces.",

         "For the last 6 months, I have tested many IEMs from $20-$300.  I am surprised how good they are.  For the ones I've tested, none of them were bad.  In fact, all of them are better than my airpod pros.  Many times better.  Unless you have to have a wireless earbuds, there is no reason not to buy one of these budget IEMs to listen to music.\n\nDunu Titan S is one of the more popular budget IEMs in the market, and one of the IEMsI  tested.\n\nThere are tons of YouTube reviews about this IEM.  You can learn about more the Pros and Cons from these videos.\n\nOne thing that stands out to me is the accessories came with this IEM.  Th pouch is high quality, and the color is beautiful.  It feels like and “smell” like a $100 fashion branded wallet.  I actually prefer it over the cases came with other more expensive IEMs.\n\nIt also comes with a number of high-quality silicone ear tips.  You must try them all to determine which set best fits you.  Ear tips make or break your experience.  If the bass is lacking, it is probably due to poor fit of your ear tips.\n\nAs for the sound quality, I really like this IEM.  It sounds natural with a slight bump in mid bass.  I prefer warm and dark sound.  I like how tight the bass is.  It is not super punchy but sounds just right.  The bass is very clean.  It gives you the sense of weight but not overwhelming.  Sometimes I do wish it had a bit more bass when listening to Jazz.\n\nThe mids are thick and comfortable.  I prefer Jazz and female vocals.  This IEM sounds so relaxing that I can listen to it for hours.  As for the highs, it is slightly on the bright side, but not shouty.  The detail is very good.  Soundstage is good for IEM, and imaging is great.  Instrument separation is surprisingly capable.  I have no problem pinpointing the position of different instruments.\n\nOverall, I really like Dunu Titan S.  For the price, it is as good as it gets.  Highly recommended.",

         "Typically I stick to higher end gaming keyboards.  Mechanical and optical switches are generally my go to.  I had never used a keyboard from this brand before so when I was given the chance to grab one, I figured I would see how it stacks up.\n\nSo far I'm fairly impressed.  I've used some tournament edition keyboards with the smaller form factor from other brands so I knew what I was getting into when it came to the size of the keyboard.  All in all, sizing is fine.  They key placement and distance between keys works fine.  I do run into issues at times where my fingers get lost on the right side of the keyboard.  Getting used to that will come in time though.  The key response is quick.  They are mechanical switches but they do manage to deaden the sound a bit which is nice.  The RGB features are basic at best.  You have a few settings you can select from and all of it is done directly on the keyboard itself.  It has your normal basic modes.  It illuminates well though and you can increase/decrease the brightness.  The build quality is nice.  For being a 75% keyboard, it has some weight to it.  I like the fact the keys are labeled for both Mac and PC.  I primarily use it on my PC though.  The place where it seems to shine is in the connectivity department.  I can connect it by bluetooth to numerous devices or I can have it wired.  I generally run wired to my main PC and if I need to use it on my MacBook or other devices, I just unplug it from the PC and connect by BT to the other device.  It works out nicely.\n\nFrom a gaming standpoint (which I do a lot of), I'm not certain that I like it as much yet.  Emphasis on the \"yet\".  I know it takes some time to become accustomed to a new keyboard.  The response and feel.  I'm going to continue gaming on it for a while to see if I become more adapted to it.  It just feels different than what I'm used to.  It most likely has to do with the key spacing more so than anything else.\n\nThis is definitely a nice keyboard and I recommend it.

         "I have an Omni Fire TV which I purchased about 6 months ago. I was excited about this sound bar - especially when I unboxed it. It looks fantastic and I thought for sure it'd be a very nice upgrade to the sound. I tried bluetooth first and it connected without a problem, but there was no sound. I tried everything I could think of but no-go. I've hooked up many speaker systems so I can almost always figure out what the problem is and it's never a big deal to me.\n\nI next tried hdmi - same thing no sound. Next, I tried the optical (which I've never used before) and it worked immediately with no problem. Well, no problem getting sound at least. A few problems came up: My Fire remote wouldn't change the sound so I would have to use the soundbar remote for sound. That's pretty much a no-go for me because that was a typical issue with technology 20 years ago - today, it's highly unusual that I can't get the soundbar to obey the Fire TV commands.\n\nAlso, the sound quality wasn't nearly as good as the native speakers on the TV. There was very little bass and the upper ranges sounded... well, what's the word? Tinny and flat? It was definitely not an improvement in sound but a significant downgrade.\n\nThis leaves the final problem which out of them all, for me, is a complete deal breaker. The soundbar volume ranges from 1-30. On 2 it was too loud for me, on 1 it was too soft. The difference between those two was huge - no gradation in sound between the numbers.\n\nWith all of the issues, I spent a long time trying to remedy them. I definitely didn't give up after 5 mins. Pretty much a whole day was spent trying to make the soundbar produce good, quality sound. I've read the reviews from others and I don't know if I got a dud or what - so many people love theirs. Overall I'm very disappointed. There's no way I'll be using this soundbar, unfortunately.\n\n* This review is for: LARKSOUND All-in-One 2.1 Sound Bar for TV, 36 Inch Soundbar with Build-in Subwoofer, Surround Sound System TV Speaker with Bluetooth/HDMI ARC/Optical/AUX/USB",

         "I used these recently on a road trip which had two 10hr+ days in the car during my \"rest period\" as a passenger.  I paired these headphones with my iPhone and iPad Pro, listening to music and also watching content from Netflix.  Although neither device has a headphone jack, I appreciate that the manufacturer includes the capability to use a cord, since that would come in particularly handy using in-seat entertainment on an airplane.  I own a set of wired Bose QuietComfort headphones that are over 10 years old and also more modern 1st gen Air Pods Pro, so that's what I will be comparing the noise cancellation against.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality.  I wouldn't say it is better than the Air Pods Pro, but was very good for the price point.  Many inexpensive headphones emphasize too much bass or not enough, these seem to be very well balanced.  The noise cancellation was also effective at getting rid of the road noise.  It is old school noise cancellation focused primarily on the lower range frequencies like road noise, airplane hum, etc. not next-level sophistication like the QC700s, Air Pods Pro 2, or Air Pods Max.  But entirely appropriate for the price point, since those models cost several times more than these.\n\nTwo things hold me back from giving these headphones five stars.  1) there is no case.  I ended up storing them in the cardboard box that they shipped in, but that is not gonna hold up long term.  I hoped that they might fit inside my old QuietComfort case but alas that did not work.  Looking at the construction materials and also knowing how my QuietComfort held up with a case, I don't think these will last long just thrown loosely into a bag.  2) the tension on the headband is quite tight.  I found myself taking these off after 3-4 hours because they were hurting my ears.  Perhaps the tension will loosen over time/usage, but I can't imagine wearing these for a whole 8 hour work day.\n\nAnother minor problem that I encountered - which possibly may be an issue only with Apple devices:  there was a slight lip-sync delay when I was watching a show on Netflix.  This delay did not occur when I switched to the Air Pods Pro, so possibly there is an issue with the Bluetooth handshaking between these headphones and Apple products.",

Looking at the construction materials and also knowing how my QuietComfort held up with a case, I don't think these will last long just thrown loosely into a bag.  2) the tension on the headband is quite tight.  I found myself taking these off after 3-4 hours because they were hurting my ears.  Perhaps the tension will loosen over time/usage, but I can't imagine wearing these for a whole 8 hour work day.\n\nAnother minor problem that I encountered - which possibly may be an issue only with Apple devices:  there was a slight lip-sync delay when I was watching a show on Netflix.  This delay did not occur when I switched to the Air Pods Pro, so possibly there is an issue with the Bluetooth handshaking between these headphones and Apple products.",

         "I use mine for a flight sim setup where i put little maps, FPL, Navigraph, MSFS and XP12 detached windows, and Helios button displays for DCS.  I also have a detachable TM MFD setup (2) that fits great over the widescreen, allowing me to port both MFD's to the same screen under each MFD bezel.  They both just fit with room on either side and in the middle to adjust to the MFD bezel position.  Edge is thick enough to hold MFDs with tape if that is what you prefer.  The monitor is plug and play, with a quick adjustment in Windows 10 display settings to get it perfect.  Oh I left the plastic protective cover on the screen to keep the TM MFDs from damaging the screen.\nDisplay is not great, but tbf, that wasn't my goal.  Its a small monitor and you are NOT gonna be watching 1080p movies on it IMHO.  I mean you can, but its not that great.  Color is a bit diffused, but brightness is excellent.  Contrast ratio is not great and there is a distinctive \"bright spot\" in the lower left hand corner (which I've covered conveniently with a TM MFD bezel plate!)  My maps and cockpit repeaters / HUD look fine on it.  It is 1920x1080 so the text / icons are very small.  But I like that.  Menu is a bit fumbled for the monitor settings, with the buttons on the back right side.\nHDMI cable provided is not good, but there is a handy extension provided to offset the HDMI plug from the back (convenient as I don't always use it (like swapping in a VR headset instead) and can easily unplug the HDMI without screwing up my setup.  The stand is meh.  It holds the monitor ok, but you can't use it to hold it when the MFDs are on it, and try to press.  It folds back and moves around with any decent pressing pressure.  Therefore I mounted it against my main monitor stand to press up against.  Works 4.0.\nI was surprised to hear it had speakers (which my Win 10 defaulted to when I plugged it in.  Not terrible but fairly loud for the size of the monitor.  Good backup speaker I guess.\nAll in all, happy with it.  It gets daily use.",

         "I wasn't looking for anything specific for wirelessly streaming music out of my phone or laptop into my vintage Kenwood and Vector Research AM/FM receivers from the late 70's. So I figured I would initially try this Esinkin Bluetooth adapter device out, as is was under $25. I just wanted to try out the technology, even though there are much higher spec and higher cost receiver adapters out there to choose from. I found out it is really the exact same device as the Logitech version, which costs just a little more. Anyway, the simple illustration type instructions could be better if written out, but easy to decipher. I like that it came with power plug adapter, and a simple 1/8\" into RCA plugs cord to get you going immediately. You can also run a dedicated short RCA cord from the Esinkin device into your Aux or Tape Monitor input jacks, but you must supply that RCA cord, which many people have lying around. Note: Do NOT plug it into the Phono input jacks. Instructions indicate you CAN actually power it off by holding down the top pairing button for at least 3 seconds. But it paired very quickly with my android phone, no problem. I have the Esinkin always in \"auto on\" mode by simply having its power adapter plugged into the \"switched\" power outlet on back of both my vintage receivers, so it will only power on and attempt to connect to my Bluetooth music devices when actually I power up the receivers themselves. Perfect. From day one since using it works flawlessly and provides nice acceptable sound when streaming Pandora, Spotify, or YouTube audio. Good lows and highs. You can look up the specs, but again will not be up to the same sound quality you may get out of the ones costing hundreds more. I get a more compressed sound quality of say MP3 files, and it will not be a full CD or FLAC/lossless audio quality. But it works great for my needs and not feeling a need to upgrade to anything else at the moment. More than satisfactory for streaming background music too. Also, the signal range was fine to any room in the house I was in with my phone, but I have a smaller home. I'm just glad I found a cool new unobtrusive device that gives me another music source option to run into my vintage home receivers, and enjoy when not listening to AM/FM, phono, or CD player.

         "I was looking for another pair of headphones/earbuds that I could keep at work. I had purchased a pair of Capoxo D8 headphones a few months ago and really liked them. Keep those at home. Great sound and features for the price. Anyways, since I was already familiar with Capaxo brand, I saw these smaller headphones with similar features.\n\nKey highlights that I like about these headphones/earbuds:\n-Extremely comfortable to wear. They don't feel heavy and fit very well. Barely feel them in your ear. I feel they fit better than the higher end headphones I have. Can shake my head and they don't budge unlike some of my past headphones/earbuds that come loose after 20-30mins or you have to adjust them so they fit better in your ear.\n-The headphones/earbuds are very compact and light. I like the compact size. As previously mentioned you can barely feel them.\n- I like the color of them. Very stylish. Nicer than the white color on the competitor headphones.\n-One of the best features is they have wireless charging! This is so convenient compared to my old headphones that you plugged into a USB port. Theres a USB C port but I'd rather do wireless charging.\nThe case is compact and not bulky. That was one complaint I had with my Capoxo D8 headphones. The case was rather large but this case is very small where its barely noticeable in your pocket.\n-Offer an excellent amount of battery life. They charge quickly and lasted me about 4 days running for 8hrs) before having to recharge them. My old headphones/earbuds would only last for about 4-5hours and then I would have to recharge them. I also like that they have a display with the battery life.\n-The hinge feels solid and not flimsy. Constructed very well. You can tell its a quality product.\n-They have good sound quality. Good amount of treble and bass.

         "OVERALL: great value, compact design, great battery, single-device connection, easy controls\n\nPROS: These earbuds have the best sound quality and BASS of all the wireless Bluetooth devices I own. The Battery arrives charged and ready to go and is unbelievably long-lasting, with extra charges in the charging case. I really like the controls and system of indicators, which are clearly explained in both the full manual as well as a smaller quick guide that I kept on my desk for the first few days. There are no buttons, all controls are just different taps on either L/R. That being said, the controls are very sensitive and I often accidentally change the volume when messing with my hair or glasses. But it's just as easily changed back. Pairing with a device is as easy as taking the earbuds out of the case and selecting the N09-A device in the Bluetooth settings on your phone/computer/TV. After charging, the earbuds connect automatically to the last device they were connected to, assuming that the device has Bluetooth turned on.\nI had low expectations for the phone function after experiences with older devices, but the phone functions on these earbuds are EXCELLENT. They work very similarly to modern Bluetooth hearing aids, whereby you accept, decline, and end calls with a tap or hold of either earpiece. Volume and music control works on a left/right system whereby the right earpiece increases volume or skips to the next music track, and the left decreases volume or skips back a track. Pretty easy stuff to learn with a little practice. You don't have to worry about wasting battery if you forget to turn them off: there is no \"OFF\" function, and they turn themselves off after 5 minutes of no Bluetooth connection (or when you put them into the case).\n\nCON: You can \"pair\" these earbuds with multiple Bluetooth devices of pretty much any type (transmitter, phone, computer, TV) BUT they will only \"connect\" with one device at a time. So, for example, I can't use them with my phone and computer at the same time. To switch from my laptop to my phone, for example, I have to turn Bluetooth off on the laptop, and then select the N09-A device on my phone.

         "When I saw this item I was excited.  I like being prepared for emergencies.  This has a solar panel, is supposedly waterproof, has a speaker, flashlight, radio, and for some reason party lights.  So in terms of use lets look at the speaker and bluetooth function.  This device connected easily and the speaker is loud.  The sound quality is good not great, not being full sounding, and slightly garbled on some songs when played at full volume.  The flashlight works and has a strobe function.  The radio works. The party lights work.  It has several inputs on the back and an on off switch none of which looked weather rated and decided not to tempt fate and ruin this thing.  There is no display so you cannot see what radio station you are listening to, volume, mode, nor your battery percentage, etc.  The sound when on the radio function was sub par, but I think of this as more of an emergency feature in this day and age, so I did not judge that too harshly.  The buttons are very confusing overall, and with no printed instructions on the unit you could get very confused trying to operate this without the box that seemed to be the only instruction list included.  I listened to it outside on BT and got about 3 hours with 80% battery (it did show battery % under my bluetooth on the phone) on full volume.  All of this would have gotten it 3 stars from me normally.  So why 1 star?  I used it outside on a sunny day and it died after 3 hours as I said.  If there is some special way to get it to charge using the solar panel I don't know.  There is no special instructions from what I saw, so I should have been able to use this in the sun and it should have charged it, or at least maintained the original battery level instead of letting it drain out.  In an emergency this would be useless since you couldn't maintain the battery with no power supply.  And I couldn't turn off the party lights, and there were no instructions, if there is a way to do so.  In any case I don't know how many flashlight radio emergency situations that call for different colored flashing lights you can't get rid of.  So 1 star, add a display, give me confidence this is weather proof, kill the party lights, and most importantly get your solar panel to work, and I'd be glad to give it 5 stars.",

If there is some special way to get it to charge using the solar panel I don't know.  There is no special instructions from what I saw, so I should have been able to use this in the sun and it should have charged it, or at least maintained the original battery level instead of letting it drain out.  In an emergency this would be useless since you couldn't maintain the battery with no power supply.  And I couldn't turn off the party lights, and there were no instructions, if there is a way to do so.  In any case I don't know how many flashlight radio emergency situations that call for different colored flashing lights you can't get rid of.

         "If you are tired of ring reflections on your glasses or an odd halo effect, this light is perfect for you.\n\nI'll start by saying the pictures for this device and the illumination shown are 100% accurate - so much that there is no need for me to include pictures of my face (thank goodness). included are pictures of the set up and the \"instruction manual\" that come with the light.\n\nThe seller notes the run time is 120 min. I found on the bright setting the light will go out after 90 - 120  min ... even though it is plugged in via the USB C compatible charging cable (included).  The cable is 1 meter long (about 39 in.).  It did not come charged right out of the box, so I had to charge it for two hours first.  This is important, as it looks like it doesn't work at first glance - it really needs to be fully charged before using or the light will go off prematurely.  Just because it is plugged into a power source, it doesn't work right away as it takes time for the Li-On 1500 m Ah to charge.\n\nThe good thing is that it the light rotates side to side and it clamps perfectly on top of a lap top and doesn't obscure the camera.  It also doesn't give me the ring reflection on my glasses that those round lights do. This light is definitely better than the overrated ring lights.\n\nThe issue is I am on Zoom for hours at a time and even 2 hours is too short if I was to use the lowest light setting.  This product is good for short calls or videos and/or a camera if you cannot plug the light into a power source.  I will need to use another light to supplement this one (or take a job with less Zoom meetings!!) as it does go out after two hours to recharge.  This will work well while on travel and for short meetings.  The clamp on this light is superb.\n\nThe instructions are funny.  \"Manul of fill light\" is definitely a bad translation and the instructions to \"connect the power outlet charging\" are 4 steps of rubbish.  Still... most could figure out how to attach the included cord from the light to your power block (not included).\n\nThis product arrived really fast and the minimal packaging is appreciated.  Hope this review helps.",

         "Very happy with this case and keyboard",
         "I purchased this for my Surface Go 3 because I wanted the keyboard, I didn't care about the case.  But after receiving it, the case is very nice.\n\nAs you can see from my pictures, the case has cut outs so you can easily turn on the tablet and adjust the volume.  Also, on the side there is a nice cut out so the different openings can be accessed, such as the charging port.  The case doesn't block anything that you need access to.  The only thing I would like to have seen be different with the case, is some type of protection around the bottom of the tablet.  This does have protection that goes around the base of the kickstand, but that will only protect the bottom of the tablet if the kickstand is in the closed position.  Once open, there is no protection to the bottom of the tablet.\n\nThe keyboard did need to be charged before I could use it.  Once charged setting it up to blue tooth was very easy.  The included instructions are very easy to understand.  It walked me through it step by step.\n\nOn the bottom right side of the keyboard is the on/off switch and the charging port for the keyboard.  It uses a USB C cable.\n\nI really like that the keyboard is wireless.  I don't have to have it attached to my tablet for it to work.  I just have to be within 33 feet.  That makes it nice when I don't have a lot of room to sit at comfortably, I can have the keyboard separate from the tablet and everything still works.  When you do want the keyboard to be attached, it is done magnetically.  Just get the keyboard close to the edge of the tablet and it snaps right in place.\n\nWhen you are done, just close the tablet using the keyboard as the cover and now you have the screen protected.  The keyboard does not snap in place once you put it over the tablet itself, but it does keep the screen covered.  It would have been nice to have some sort of snap mechanism that the keyboard went into to keep it secured to the front of the screen.\n\nI think this is a fantastic keyboard and case.  I had been pricing keyboards and going with this one saved me a lot of money and I got a case in the bargain.  This is well worth the price.",
